## About Kairos

Kairos is an intelligent layer that transforms static voice AI agents into dynamic, self-optimizing assets. The current approach to managing agents is broken; it involves endless manual prompt tweaking and analysis after performance inevitably plateaus.

We are solving this by building a system that doesn't just provide insights‚Äîit autonomously acts on them. Kairos observes an agent's real-world interactions, learns what conversational strategies lead to success, and automatically experiments with and deploys these winning strategies in real-time.

## The Problem

1.  **Static Performance:** Voice agents today operate on fixed prompts and cannot learn from experience, leading to repeated mistakes and customer frustration.
2.  **The "Cold Start" Problem:** New agents launch with zero experience, requiring weeks or months of manual tuning to become effective.
3.  **Manual & Unscalable Optimization:** Improving agents relies on humans analyzing logs and guessing at better prompts‚Äîa slow, unscientific, and expensive process.

## The Solution: The Kairos Learning Loop

Kairos introduces a perpetual, autonomous improvement cycle built on three core pillars:

1.  **Analyze & Discover:** We ingest and analyze live and historical call data to find statistically significant patterns, learning what your best agents and humans do to achieve successful outcomes.
2.  **Experiment Autonomously:** Our contextual bandit engine safely tests new, data-driven strategies in real-time, intelligently balancing the use of proven winners with the exploration of new possibilities.
3.  **Adapt & Improve:** Winning strategies are automatically promoted and deployed, dynamically enhancing your agent's behavior. Your agent gets quantifiably better with every call.

## Core Features

*   **Expertise Distillation Engine:** Solve the cold-start problem by bootstrapping your new agent with the distilled wisdom from years of your own historical call logs. Achieve high performance from day one.
*   ‚ö° **Real-time Adaptation Engine:** Our live learning loop never stops. The contextual bandit ensures your agent is always using the optimal strategy for any given user or situation, adapting its behavior in milliseconds.
*   **Proactive Opportunity Engine:** Kairos doesn't just optimize‚Äîit innovates. We analyze conversations to proactively suggest new, data-driven product offerings and process improvements for your business.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) & Celery
*   **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript) & Tailwind CSS
*   **Database:** Supabase Postgres with `pgvector`
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
*   **AI/ML:** OpenRouter (LLMs), OpenAI (Embeddings), Scikit-learn, and a custom Thompson Sampling implementation.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing the core Kairos platform.

*   `/backend`: The FastAPI application, learning engines, and public-facing API. (Closed Source)
*   `/frontend`: The Next.js Command Center for analytics and management. (Closed Source)
*   `kairos-agent-sdk` (Coming Soon): The open-source Python SDK will be hosted in a separate public repository to foster community trust and easy integration.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the **pre-development planning phase**. The codebase is being actively built according to a phased engineering plan.
