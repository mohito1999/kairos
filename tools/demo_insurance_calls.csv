Customer: I'm okay, but I'm not really interested in any Medicare plans right now.

Agent: I completely understand, and I appreciate your honesty. Many people feel that way at first. However, there are plans that could potentially save you money or offer additional benefits. Can I just verify your information to see what options might be available for you?

Customer: I guess, but I just don’t want to be pushed into anything.

Agent: I hear you, and I want to assure you that my goal is not to push you into anything. Instead, I want to ensure you have accurate information about what’s available. Can you confirm your date of birth for me?
