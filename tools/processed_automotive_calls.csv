Oh, no, I'm saying can get it fixed on your part, like figure out who it was and do something about the situation. Not just a slap on the wrist. I mean, obviously. Well, you can settle there, but if you're just going to.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How may I direct your call? [PERSON_NAME], maybe? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. One moment. Thank you. You're welcome. It's a great day here at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Is [PERSON_NAME], how can I help? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], I had a missed call. I'm not sure if it was from you or [PERSON_NAME] or Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. All right, hang on a second. All right. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, sir. Hey, man, this is [PERSON_NAME] over at [ORGANIZATION]. How's it going today? Doing good, man, how are you? I'm doing well. Appreciate you asking. So we've been taking a look at the deal and this is kind of where we're at. So since you're out of state, we only have one [OCCUPATION] that we can use because we have a [DURATION] [DURATION] funding policy and we only have one [OCCUPATION] that is able to accomplish that for us. It's [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. So [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] for Prime is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. However, you would still get all of the equity back for the credit cards that you were talking about. And it's way, way lower than those rates. And it's always an option to refi in the future as well, especially if your bank will give you five. Five. You can just buy it here and turn around and refinance it. So. So the total loan amount would be what, [MONEY_AMOUNT], is that right? Let me. I'm actually mobile right now over at [PERSON_NAME] desk. I'm gonna have him transfer me to my. Actually, I don't have. Give me just a second. Will you pull up his file? We've got a lot of construction going on in the dealership, so they have us upstairs in like this little tiny room. No worries. There we go. Okay. So you don't have to, do you, [PERSON_NAME], give me just a second, okay? Okay, yeah, no worries. Cool, thanks. He's on there and I've got it turned up. Can you hear me, [PERSON_NAME]? Yeah, I can hear you. Okay, cool. So it looks like I've got your deal pulled up over here. What was the trade? The Tacoma [DATE_INTERVAL]. [DATE_INTERVAL] Tacoma TRD. This half was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is that correct? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. 3 Tacoma. We're hitting it [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So total amount financed would be [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's if we applied the equity towards the vehicle. So what if I took out all the equity? What did the rate change at? $[MONEY_AMOUNT] of equity. So let me see what that would do to it. So us giving you an $[MONEY_AMOUNT] check would put your total finance at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So how do we get to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] when the price of the truck online was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]? We have a [MONEY_AMOUNT] processing fee, and then there's a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] lien fee. That's for the filing, state filing. So it ends up being a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] add for the back end. So if you take the [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Unless your trade. So. Because if I got [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the Tacoma minus my payoff, that's like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. No, I do apologize. [PERSON_NAME] just told me that it was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I was going off of [MONEY_AMOUNT] because that was the last thing that was saved in here. So at [MONEY_AMOUNT] Fox, it would put you at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So let me change these numbers real quick. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So [MONEY_AMOUNT], you'd be financing [MONEY_AMOUNT] if you took that check back now at 7.49%. Do what at 7.49%. I believe that's what their prime is. Yes, man. A lot cheaper than that. Than that rate at the credit card. Oh, yeah, no, that's. That's for sure. But, man, that's. The truck's worth about [MONEY_AMOUNT], I think. Do you. Is it that they'll finance you once you get back? Probably, yeah. I mean, you know, I work here, so probably, man, you're looking at about a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] difference between [MONEY_AMOUNT] and [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So realistically, you know, come here finance with us just because we don't. Now, you could always send us a wire. That is an option. So. And that, you know, again, $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] over the course of [DURATION] [DURATION] saves you quite a bit of money. About [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. Let's see. The only issue we're having is that a lot of our [OCCUPATION] are unable to fund a deal within [DURATION] [DURATION] if it's an out of state purchase. Yeah. So basically, how long does this deal last? Sells. If you call me back today or tomorrow, I'm gonna honor it. But if someone walks in here and buys the vehicle, then, you know, there's nothing I can do about that. Yeah. But if you want to think on it, then I'll honor that deal. I mean, you know, for as long as you need, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] or whatever. But we'd like to get something done before the end of the month if possible. Just. Yeah, yeah. The thing is, you know, about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] away. And I just realized my nephew's birthday party is tomorrow, so my timing isn't great. I have a [OCCUPATION] that is a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] that is actually insured and employed by our dealership. And this is all he does, is he does out of state deliveries for us. When there's a trade involved, it's super easy because it only requires one [OCCUPATION], and he can bring it straight to you at the birthday party or if you were at work or home or whatever. So that's always an option, too. All right, man. So I'm kind of stuck. Not really sure what I could do. You know, if you'd be willing to do, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT] even on the truck, and, you know, that being the finance amount, then, you know, I'd probably take that offer. And I know it's not a big difference, but it at least gives me a little bit of peace of mind. Let me look at this for a second. What's wrong with [MONEY_AMOUNT]? [MONEY_AMOUNT] [PERSON_NAME]? I'm gonna need to run this by someone with a little bit authority than I am, because at that. All right, that's. All right. $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So let me deal with him, and I'll give you a holler right back. All right, man. I appreciate it. Yep. Thank you. Bye.

I call and they told me that that same vehicle and that told me the same thing on that vehicle. So there's like three dealerships, you know, pulling the same vehicle. Nine. Hold on. Oh, the second one. I'm sorry. All right, let's see. Okay, so that was [ORGANIZATION]. So the second one was [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Now they were probably just trying to earn your business. I'm not sure as to why they told you that that specific one was on ground, but this one is at our level. That, that's just kind of scary because why would the three [OCCUPATION] tell me on one vehicle that this is just what I, I cannot understand. Last time I was searching for a vehicle there and it was just, I Guess some weird stuff going on there and it's just like, you know, I just. Wow. I guess it's better to buy it from the public then, you know, because. Yeah. So would you, would you write for me? Would you like for me to get you over to a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] so they can clarify this for you? No, no, no, no, no, no. I just, that this is just kind of. I don't want to do this because it's just kind of. I, I don't know. You don't have the vehicle, they don't have. But I go, the other [OCCUPATION] doesn't have the vehicle. I don't know who has the vehicle. But you don't have to. That's the thing. I. Now I do apologize about what the other dealerships might have told you, but I am telling you that this deal vehicle is here. That's what they told me. Now the first number I want to mention, 163,000 miles, [DATE_INTERVAL] LE. Right now the first number that you've given me, [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. That is our dealership. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. So that vehicle is here. I do remember you mentioning the [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] number. Yeah. But now the other dealership told me the same thing. The other number told me the same thing. And now you telling me the same thing. So who owns the vehicle? Sir, I'm. Like I said, I'm not sure as to why the other dealerships may have told you that they have this vehicle, but I'm telling you that there's only one way to find out. Okay, I just gave you the number. You might want to call them and have somebody call them and ask for a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Sienna. La. I'm looking right at the Sienna. There is no reason for me to call the other dealerships. Well, I mean, I'm just saying that. So why are they giving me the same information you are? And if you telling me that you, you guys own the vehicle. They're saying they own the vehicle. Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and transfer to one of my [OCCUPATION]. Let's put it at the customer. Customer.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION]. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? Hey, this is [PERSON_NAME]. How you doing? Hey, good. How you doing, Mr. [PERSON_NAME]? I'm good. What's your name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, sir. That'll work. I'll make sure I heard it right. I was looking around online a little bit. I think I chatted with somebody over the weekend. I gave her my email, but I don't know if she passed it on. I didn't hear from anybody, but I was noticing and they might out and still be there. But I was noticing you had a couple of white [ORGANIZATION] CRVs, the Sport model. Yes, sir, I do. You talking about new, correct? Brand new? Yes, sir. I have like three or four of them, I believe. Yeah, I was looking at the ones with the black interior. Can you do me a favor? I'm at work right now, but can you fix me up a drive out price and send it to my email? Because I don't live in [LOCATION]. What's the best email for you? Okay, I've got a [DATE_INTERVAL], a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] CRV. We want white. Yep. White on black. And does it matter? All wheel or front wheel? It really don't. The ones that I looked at was showing hybrid and all wheel drive. I think I looked at two of them that y' all had. I didn't know you had four of them, but. Yeah, so you could send both and. But you know, just the best drive out price you can give me. And I. And I probably. I've got a [ORGANIZATION] CRV [DATE_INTERVAL] right now, EXL. And it's black. It's black leather. I love the black leather. I know those seats are not leather in the sports, but if the price is right, I might talk about swapping them out for leather seats anyway or just doing it on my own. I don't know. I gotcha. I got you. How many are you gonna be trading in your crv? I probably will if they'll give me the right amount. It's. It's got. I drive the hell out of it. On all interstate, though. I drive from [LOCATION] to [LOCATION] to [LOCATION], [LOCATION], and I do that every week. So it's got 26,700 or 26,800 miles on it, but I mean, there's nothing wrong with it. It's nice. Except for I do, I do put a lot of miles on it. Yeah. Just because work and everything. Yes, this. But they're showing. You know, I sent in a few offers. Cargo rules. Carvana so everybody's offering like right around $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for it on trade in or whatever or buy. So it probably needs to be somewhere in that area. Depends on how much the new car is too, at drive out. But I don't know if I even want to. It's gonna have to be something I can afford. I owe about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. A little over [MONEY_AMOUNT] on this car I've got now. But that's because I bought it during the. God dang. When the chip. When they didn't have no chips for them. And so I bought this car, I went upside down and to start with from day one. But I love my car, though. And can you also. I don't know if it's too much trouble. Don't worry about it. But like, when you send the email, can you tell me some of the differences between. From looking just looking at the pictures, only thing I see different between mine and the Sport is the seats are not leather because it's still got the sunroof. I mean, still got the moon roof, of course, the package. You know, the wheels are different, the mirrors are different, all that. But I'm just. I don't see a whole lot of difference in the exl in the Sport. No, there's not going to be a ton of difference. I mean, mine, you know, this one's got everything. Yeah. The only difference you would see because, I mean, you still have the heated seats and everything. It would literally be the leather seats now in the2023, the EXLs have wireless charging pads. Yeah, I can. Does yours have a wild charging set? No, I don't. Yeah, I probably won't go. I like the Sport models better because they got the. They got the black rims and the black mirrors and the black grill and the ones I got. I love my car, but God dang everyone. You look at everybody, they're all just alike. My neighbor's got one exactly like it right next door and. And you know, the. All the wheels are the same from 20, 21 and 22. All the wheels are the same. So you can't tell them apart. Get on my nerves. I definitely get it. But send that stuff over to your email. Yeah. See what you can do. A good trade about evaluation. I have to that to probably put a better number. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I, I do understand that. That they'll have somebody have to see it and drive it and all that. I do know that. But I'm just telling you what other people has offered so that. I do know that. I Have to bring it up there and let somebody drive it and all that crap. Yeah. And like I said, the numbers, the numbers are going to be the big thing if we can get all these numbers worked out and see, I'm confused too about. I'll probably go through my bank for financing unless you guys can beat it. But if you see a lot of advertisements on TV, they're advertising 2.9, 3.9, but if you look it up online, Everybody's showing like 5.7, 5.9 right now. Yes. See that's now the way that we're able to do the 3.9s and things like that and the 4 point whatevers is short term financing. So like [ORGANIZATION] will offer that for like let's say if it's like [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah. You would get that rate and then I could flip it over to the bank. The rates may come down. Yeah. Like you could refinance it. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. The last time when I bought my truck, I financed it through the [ORGANIZATION], but the very next day I went to the bank and. And they paid off the [ORGANIZATION] and I just financed it through the bank. It was cheaper, a lot cheaper. Yeah. But now [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] got. [ORGANIZATION] got some pretty good rates. Yeah, but yeah, it just depends. Like I said, it's going to be a numbers game for me. I don't want to. I got a feeling I'm gonna have to pay a little more. Yeah. Monthly. But I don't want to go up. I don't want to do something I can't afford. For sure. For sure. But see what kind of deals you can work up. Help me out and because like I said, I'm putting a lot of miles on these vehicles. That's why I was thinking about. Just go ahead and before I get submitted down miles on it, just go ahead and get a. No while you got some equity in it. Exactly. Yeah. I got you. I definitely got that. I can get it figured out and do everything. All right, my friend. Yes, sir. And Mr. [PERSON_NAME]. What was your last name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. I'm originally from [LOCATION], but I live in [LOCATION] now. Gotcha, gotcha. Okay. Live in [LOCATION]. Working [LOCATION]. Father my. Yeah. You drive a lot. Yeah, I mean it's all pretty much four lane interstate. Hardly do any city driving, but still it's just putting a lot of miles on the car. Yeah, yeah. But [ORGANIZATION] service. [ORGANIZATION] done all my service. I just had a service. Wheels rotated. I just had an air filter put on it, so it's in good shape. Okay, well, that's good to hear. You gonna be hearing back from me? Just a little bit. I'm getting my [OCCUPATION] to send that over to you. Okay. All right, that's fine. I'm in no hurry. Yeah, okay. All right, Sounds good.

Hey, I had a question. Sure. We had bought a car from y' all like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago and we got the warranty on it and so actually we were. We unexpectedly got [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. So do you. If we were to trade it in, is there a rebate value for what you haven't used or how does that work? Is there or is it. Yeah. So yeah, when it comes to extended warranty that you're going to be canceling out early, essentially you just get prorated the remaining amount. Okay. And it gets refunded to you and you can apply that towards. Or either just to check back to you directly or you can apply it towards another warranty on another vehicle. Okay. Okay. Now is that, is that any. Okay, I see what you're saying. Well, thank you so much. Yeah, yeah, you'll just get accredited towards another one. Are you looking to upgrade to a bigger vehicle?

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How to help you? Hi, I looked on your website and it listed an msrp. And then below it it had a [ORGANIZATION] msrp. What is that exactly? Yes. Well, [PERSON_NAME], what were you interested in? I was looking at your 20, 24 tracts, 2Rs. Oh, got it. Yes. So basically what that would just mean is the vehicle on top of this price itself. And then of course, whatever is at the bottom is a [ORGANIZATION] employee discount. If you have like a [ORGANIZATION] code. No, I don't have it. Oh, so it's only for [ORGANIZATION] employees, It's not for anybody else? That is correct yet, but let me verify for us. Give me one moment. Just so I don't give you false information. I just want to see what you're looking at. Okay. And your name was? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, got it. Let's see. Oh, I was looking at your 2Rs. Oh, got it. Now I know what you mean. Yes. So what that just means is that right now the price of the vehicle is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [ORGANIZATION] MSRP is whatever. When that vehicle arrives to a dealership, it may change a little bit or it could stay the same because the vehicle hasn't arrived just yet. I thought it was some kind of a discount. Yeah.

Yeah, because I already put down they deposit at another [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION]. And I thought if you guys had a discount, then I would move over to you guys. But it doesn't sound like you do, so I'm just. What I could do is follow up with you and see if you're still on the market when the vehicle arrives. And whatever incentive rate incentives or rebates there is, we'll go ahead and honor it for you. Okay. And the one I was looking at was your 2Rs with the. With the upgrade. So I think it was listed at [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh, yes, I do see that gray in gray. The one in gray? Yeah. Okay, got it. Okay, guys, if you like, I could write down your number. And then if I get it sooner and you're still interested in purchasing one, then you can come down with us as well. Okay, I'll give you my number, then you can text. Text or call. Yeah. I'm hoping that your offer like a discount because I think some people, some dealerships in the [LOCATION] and up north are offering discounts. So I was hoping you guys were too. Yes, we do offer discounts. If there's any discounts available when [ORGANIZATION] releases that rebates, we'll go ahead and honor them. But the vehicle is in here yet, so we're not sure what rebates it might have. But we're not marking up our new vehicles, which is a good thing to know as well. Right. And how can you tell when it's coming? Can you track it or you don't? Did it leave the factory or where it. Yes, I can most definitely track it for us. I'm sorry? Yes, I can most definitely track it for us to see when it should be here. Oh, okay. Can you tell. Tell me now when you think it'll be there? Yes. Is it the one that is like a. Exterior shark. Shark sin metallic. Is that the one you're looking at? Okay, got it. Yes, I think it was [MONEY_AMOUNT] listed. Yes. Let me see. Give me one moment. Okay. Thanks for your help. I appreciate it. Yes, no problem. Okay. And it looks like. Have you purchased vehicles here with us before? No. No. Oh, God. Okay. I did see your information in my system. I probably thought you did purchase a vehicle before. I. I tried to get you to purchase my car, but you didn't give me a good enough deal, so I went and sold it somewhere else for a lot more money. Like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. Okay. But that's been like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. So this one is looking to arrive on the [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DURATION]. It could be sooner than that. So in a, in about [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yes. Okay, then I'll just wait to hear from you. And if the other one comes in quicker or if I find you don't have any like brighter colors like blue or orange coming in, do you that have the same two RF with the both of those packages? Well, I definitely, most definitely want to keep your number just because they did mention to us we're going to get a couple coming in [DATE] [DURATION] and it's going to be a big shipment. So it might be possible that I might get like a brighter color, something you like going. Based on what I saw right now that you're interested in, I could see what would be equivalent to that on a different color. And I could also keep you updated as well with my inventory. I appreciate it. What was your name again? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. That's what I thought. Okay. And I'm just going to text you right now so you have my information as well.

Let me see if it's available. How long will it take from the factory? A special order? Something depends on the vehicle. Super duties tend to take a little longer. Yeah. So shows it's been here [DURATION] [DURATION]. Not sure why this customer hasn't picked up their car. Let me see something like this. Actually, something like this would be quick because I ordered [TIME]. Let me see exactly what it is. Yeah, this [TIME], I don't think this would take long. Maybe if we're still able to order something like this, probably [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yes. So this vehicle right here is available. Is it possible to pick it up or do you guys do it for [MONEY_AMOUNT]? No, it's not available. It's customers special order. And we don't discount Super Duties. We sell them right at MSRP. Every other vehicle we sell, [MONEY_AMOUNT] over invoice. It's a non specialty right now. Super duties. Other [OCCUPATION] are selling them for [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] over MSRP. So we just do right at sticker price. So the selling price would be the selling price if it becomes available. 75, 44 5. What's the actual ratio on this guy? [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Electronic locking. So people want the [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] instead of the 4, 8 because of the gas efficiency. Is that why? Yeah, yeah. You get a little better fuel mileage. If you don't need that for, for, for towing, then everybody just goes for the [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] or [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. I mean it tells enough, but you wouldn't know if this guy's picking it up or not or. I do not. It's been here looks like [DURATION] [DURATION]. Let me, let me see if I could search the customer's name, check the system, but no specials from [EVENT] [EVENT]. Not on super duties. Interest rate is whatever you get from whatever bank you want to go to. Or we can send your info to a bank and then sell it for msrp. No rebates. [ORGANIZATION] hasn't Posted rebates on super duties in probably over [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Unless the customer has their own certificate in their name.

Yes, [ORGANIZATION] Ultimate Package FX4. But the diesel, they tow more. Right. But yeah. Is it harder to change the oil on those guys? It's probably harder on any vehicle now. They're so jam packed in there that. Yeah, and more and more quarts of oil too. Oh, I see. Let's see, that's going for 80, 86. 86 and change. The customer's looking at it right now. Yeah. Okay. Either [TIME] of them become available? All. The blue [TIME] I'll know in the next probably [DURATION] [DURATION]. Oh, he's really. He's locked in on it? Yeah, yeah, he's just randomly walked in.

Sure, let me just log into the computer real quick. One second. Okay. Hu. You're in touch with the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] again for the hybrid, we're looking at the. The Gravity gray or the white one. What was, what colors? You said white. And what else? Gravity gray. Yeah. Are they the same price? One is like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] cheaper. The gravity grade is like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] cheaper. Yeah, well, either one would be fine. So it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT] less. Let's go for that one. It's just I have it up. So the Prestige. What is. I'm just, I'm trying to get familiar with the Sportage Pipers because there's a whole bunch of them. But the Alex and this Prestige, what's the difference between those [TIME]? So the LX is the base. So like it comes with cloth seats. Does it have. They both have. Well, the, the SX Prestige comes with leather seats, the LX comes with cloth. Ah, so the Prestige comes with leather, the other ones with clothes. Yeah, that's the only difference. And the Prestige is fully loaded, so it has everything like the surround view monitor, the upgraded sound system, the panoramic sunroof, the smart lift gate. You get the heated seats, cool seats, heated steering wheel, everything like that with the key control, they open up the trunk and stuff like that. Yeah. So like the automatic lift gates where you just press the button and opens by itself. Okay. That's why it's a little bit more than the lx. Yeah, it's about like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] more than [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] more than it has. Go ahead. I'm sorry. As the what Sorry. Has the. What you said the parking assist. So where like if somebody parks too close to you at the grocery store, you have that ability to move the car out without getting inside the car. I don't know what that. What is that? I don't have all these luxury cars. So what is if they're in the grocery store, what do I do? Yeah, but like, you know how like some people, like if they park too close to you, you can't get in your car? Uh huh. You can't get in the car. Okay. So you remote start a sport is hybrid, and then you have [TIME] buttons to press, either forward or backwards, depending on which way you park. You just hold that button down. Then the car moves out without you getting inside the car also. It pulls out so we can go in. Yes, ma' am. Ah. Oh, wow. It's a lot. So how in this website, try to understand. It said it says [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then they have a market adjustment. It comes out to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is that the out the door? Is that extra still? That's extra. So taxes on a hybrid is about [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], depending on your zip code. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. I just like to be prepared. I don't like going, going. And then I can't say I can't buy it because I don't. We're not able to offer a little less. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. One second. And then I just got to get your first and last name, then I'll get a zip code and then I'll get you the out the door price. Okay, sure. What is your first name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Your last name again? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. What is your zip code? [LOCATION]. Are you interested in, like, lifetime oil changes? So you get like four oil changes per [DURATION] [DURATION] for as long as you own the car. Oh, what was that on the car? For what? Sorry, we're driving Lifetime oil changes. Lifetime oil changes? Yes. You get four oil changes per [DURATION] [DURATION] for as long as you own the car. How much is that extra? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, go ahead and add it. You can always remove it, right? Yes. Are you interested in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? What was that? [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. He said no. Okay. After their price. Like, did you want to show me? Did you want me to show you? Like, finance options? You do finance? Okay. What's the interest rate on your end on the sportage Hybrid it is. What is the credit score? Let's just say it's about. We have about 7 to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. We have good credit. Okay. That's about a [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [DURATION] [DURATION]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. How long? [DURATION] [DURATION]. Just inside. Old message. You can go less if you want another one. About the same rate in the bank. The interest rate is with [ORGANIZATION], but we can always show you a different bank or we can send it to your bank. If you use the bank that we use. Yeah. Can you guys compare? Oh, that's good. What bank do you use? Do you guys use we have a cheap [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. There's no way it's going to be cheap. But I think a long time ago [ORGANIZATION] did some interest rate years ago. But we were going to try. It was going to be an [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. So we use different credit unions. We can always send you to a credit union. I think the best one is probably like [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Oh, I didn't know about that one. Okay. I think we use [ORGANIZATION]. We use [ORGANIZATION]. We use [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. We use. Yeah. Oh yeah, I said the [ORGANIZATION]. Looking online. No [ORGANIZATION]. No, I meant what's the other one? Oh there's like [ORGANIZATION]. Yes. And there's another one. I can't remember off the top of my head, but I looked at it. It was a little higher interest. But you'll help us there, right? If we go in. But what will be the. Give you give me an idea how much will be out the door for that one? Hello. So okay, so there is. So MSRP is [PHONE_NUMBER], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The [TIME] guy markup is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Taxes is [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Gap in lifetime oil changes in [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Registration fee is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Documentation fees $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Let's just keep at it, huh? So you're looking at at about so [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] even. Which would be the outer door price. Okay, so It'll be about [MONEY_AMOUNT] if you take out the maintenance. Yeah. If we don't do. If you don't do the oil changes it'll be. Yeah, like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, like 47ish. But that's the Prestige with everything. Yeah. And it has red interior. I don't know if you want red or black. But this one has red. Red interior. Yes. I never had a red. You see black or green. And then this one. A little bright, isn't it? No, it's not as bright. I have red interior in my K5. It's not as bright. Oh my goodness. Wow. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Almost $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. But I get it. The Prestige. So the Alex Hybrid L, the Alex would probably be about below [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Like probably like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. About [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, but the. Yeah. And I have the base one here that the SX Prestige would be here at the end of the month and all the one I saw on the website. Yes, the one, the gray one will be here at the end of the month. The end of the month. Okay, so that's [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then the regular [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], you don't have that. So I could see it. I have it installed. Let me see. Let me just double check. I have it here. I'm pretty sure. Okay. And you won't be able to lower the price. I mean, I'm not. I'm not fond of that. Red flag on the Sport of hybrids. Not. No. Just because we don't have those in stock. We have everything else but the Sport. Hybrid. Sportive, Hybrid are the only vehicles that are hard to keep on the lot. Yeah. So I have a white one and then I have a steel gray. The LX hybrid. Sport is hybrid. The LX hybrid. You have a white one and. I'm sorry, a white one. And what else? Steel gray. Steel gray. Okay. And you guys are located [LOCATION], where [LOCATION] is. Yes, we're right next to. We're kind of by the mall. [LOCATION] [LOCATION], a little past [LOCATION]. Okay. See, no, it's gonna be tough for us because we're in [LOCATION] and we have an appointment about [TIME], so it's gonna be hard for us to see it today. I can send you pictures of whichever. Okay, good. Yeah, can you send me both? Because on the website doesn't need to show me the inside of that procedure. And also, is the back the same as the. The. The hybrid lx? Yes, the whole body style is the same. Just the inside would be different. The leather, of course, instead of the fabric. And all the electronics. Yeah, correct. Yeah. Yeah. Can you send me the. The. The out the door as well for the Alex with the pictures that we can compare? Yeah. Okay. And then for the. And for the loan, do I do it there or. You just send me the bank lenders to call? I will send you. You could do the credit that. We'll send it to whatever credit union you want us to send it to. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah, please. Thank you. Yes, your email address. Let me know when you're ready. I'm ready. It's gonna be for my first initial of my name and then the last name is [PERSON_NAME]. I just sent it. Please let me know when you get it. If you don't get it, I will send it again. Yes. So you put [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. You said Ms. And [PERSON_NAME], right? Yeah, [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, I just sent it again. Oh, I got one. It says the new financial credit application. Wait, where'd it go? That is me. If you got it. That is me. Yeah, I don't know what happened to it. Is it not there anymore? I Don't know, I. I just saw it but it disappeared. This is so odd. I don't know, I just. Oh, it went to junk mail. I saw it on my inbox. It went away. It usually goes to your junk mail. Okay, so please click on the credit application. Yep. And then I'll email over the out the door price for the LX there. You have that too. And then you guys can compare it. Okay. Yes. Anybody? Photos. Trying to get familiar with your [ORGANIZATION]. I never had one before. They are better than they were back then. That's a good news. Yeah. The warranty is probably the best that [ORGANIZATION] could have done is the warranty. So you get a 10, 100 powertrain. So anything that touches the oil. And then if you get the hybrid, you get a 10,000, [DURATION] [DURATION] 100,000 mile battery warranty. You get a [DURATION] [DURATION] 60 roadside, a [DURATION] [DURATION] 60 limited basic, and a [PHONE_NUMBER] [DURATION] [MONEY_AMOUNT] bumper to bumper. Oh, okay. Thank you. You'll put that in the email. I will put that in the email too. Oh, perfect. Thank you. Yeah, we're like, we'll all look into it. I'll show it to my [MARITAL_STATUS]. And then first we gotta do the credit. And then you said about [DURATION] [DURATION] for the procedure. You have [TIME] to look at and we can, I guess [TIME] of the base models to look at. And then the SS proceeds will be here at the end of the month. Perfect, thank you. And I contact you through the email or call you or do you put your direct number. My direct numbers.

We look forward to talking. Be right back with you. Hello, it's [PERSON_NAME]. Hey [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME]. Hey [PERSON_NAME], can you help me with something? Certainly. So, stock number? Well, do you want the stock number or the last state of the thing? Because when I asked [PERSON_NAME], I got the answer that this car is at the dealership and apparently it's not. What is this talk number? The stock number is [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, that is a [DATE_INTERVAL] Elantra value. I have [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's correct. Yeah. Okay, can you physically tell me if this car is sitting at your dealership? It's. It says location is at a dess on [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay, well that's. That's the issue we're having because [PERSON_NAME] took it off the truck and then when I tried to verify because it up picked apparently when the truck dropped off. Right. Technically it's the truck's fault. I had re updated everything because they were supposed to take the number [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. That's allegedly the car that the driver was supposed to take. And apparently that is actually sitting at your yard. Oh boy. But [PERSON_NAME] told me the opposite. Okay, what's the other stock number? The other last date of the van. The other one is [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. To our knowledge, from the driver that was allegedly the one that was picked up and switched on the invoice because [PERSON_NAME] switched like two cars on that load. But now they're saying. And [PERSON_NAME] verified. When I react like I don't know, like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago I said is this car on your lot? Meaning the one that ends in [VEHICLE_ID]? He said that car is waiting for a title. It is an out of state title and it's taking a while to get here. I assumed that meant the car was on your lot. Right. So you want to hold? You want to hold? You want me to call you back? Can I hold please? Yeah, sure. Thank you. You're for waiting. Your patience is appreciated. Please hold the line and we'll be right back with you. Thank you for holding.

Please hold the line and we'll be right back with you. You're not A one deal. Hello? Hello? So I'm not sure I don't have the keys for either one of these cars. Okay, so hold on a minute. And I've looked everywhere. You know, they're not in the machine, they're sold out of the machine. And the. And they're not. They're not on the wholesale board either. Okay. So according to what I have is notes, [VEHICLE_ID] is allegedly from my. From what I know is allegedly still at your dealership, but [ORGANIZATION] is saying that they have it. But if they do have it and you can't seem to find the car now, I don't know where the car would be. So. Hang on, let me look. Let me look at my [ORGANIZATION] inventory real quick. Okay, so [VEHICLE_ID] is verified at. Is verified at [ORGANIZATION]. Apparently. It's. It's on there. It's on their. Their list. Okay, so 3. So they scanned it in [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. So the missing vehicle in question is the one ending in [PHONE_NUMBER]. Yes. So if that is not checked into Adesa, which according to my notes, it was, so you should have that car somewhere. Right, So I will go. Allegedly, Yes. I will go outside and I'll touch every Elantra out there. Okay. And. And I'll. I'll see if I can find it. If. And. And I'll email you, call you back. Okay.

Didn't know if maybe you could check your updated system and maybe it snuck in. Yeah, just about to the right screen here and my screen. My computer's being slow. Wouldn't you know it? That's hard for the course. Yeah. All right, I'm going to try her one more time and fingers crossed. All right, we're getting some information pulled up here. This one has not arrived yet. Let me see if I can get any kind of an ETA on when we might get this. But you're looking at the 2500 Sierra, the Pro edition, right? Yep. Okay. With the gas engine. Yeah. All right, let me see if I can tell you when we might see this thing. It looks like it will be here around the [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Approximately around the [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Okay, that's too late for us. Can you. Too late. Can you check your inventory and just see if you have anything else that would be similar or if that's the only one. I'm looking for a [ORGANIZATION] 2500. I want it to be gas, not diesel. And I need it in your hand on your lot. Not coming. Okay. And has to be a [ORGANIZATION] Chevy. Won't work. No. Thank you. Okay. All right, let's see what pops up here. And it can be new or used. It doesn't have to be brand new. Could be used. Okay. Well, I feel like I'm looking for a diamond in the rough. Yeah, the. That one that you gave me, that was a crew cab. Right. I guess I didn't even double check that. Yeah, I've got. It looks like I might have a double cab with the smaller back seat, but it does not look like I have a crew cab. Yeah, we have to get. Has to be a crew cab. Sure, sure. Yeah. And I think I. And I think I have a Silverado custom, but yeah, I don't. It does not look like I have a [ORGANIZATION] Sierra 2500 gas engine right now. And you're needing it like today basically. In other words, like before Wednesday. Before Wednesday. Okay. Before the end [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. So it'll take me a little while to look through our pre owned to see if I've got anything like that. But if I have something, is it something you'd be able to come over to [ORGANIZATION] today? I can find something. Possibly. I've got a couple errands to do here in [LOCATION] and I've got two kids that really just need to fall asleep and take a nap. All right. So I could make on the table would be like if you had a used [ORGANIZATION] S250 gas improved house. Again, if he had a. Those would be the only things that we would wiggle on. And if it's used, I really don't want it to have more than like 50,000 miles. Yeah. I was just going to ask what your criteria was for odometer, so. Okay. All right. And I didn't catch your name.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME]. Do you guys have any [ORGANIZATION] S5 available? I have a brand new one. You said your name is [PERSON_NAME]? Yeah, yeah, sounds great. [PERSON_NAME], when can you come in and see our beautiful [DATE_INTERVAL]? I'm located in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], so I was really just curious on all the details on it. Is it the sportback? Okay, yeah, it is a sportback. Do you have a bill sheet on it? Yeah, I can send it to you. Would you be just curious? Because, you know, on our vehicles we're just. We typically don't sell out of state, so, I mean, I wouldn't want to waste anybody's time here. Are you looking to buy the car or lease the car? I would buy the car, but I would go down there and buy it. Okay, so you would be coming in to buy the car. Okay, Just want to make sure. Just because again, one away from all these logistics. So, yeah, I can send you the build sheet. Do you want me to text it to you or email it to you? Text would be better, please. Sure. What's the number? I can text it to you. [PHONE_NUMBER] Sounds great. Okay, [PERSON_NAME], so I can text you that information in just a few moments. I'm going to just send it through my cell phone and. Yeah, so you said you'd be able to come in potentially and see the car. When would that be? If it checks all the boxes, it would most likely be this weekend or next. Okay, what are you looking for on your S5? The Sportback Black or white exterior with the red leather seats and black optic package with the sport package. Got it. Okay, well, mine has neither of those options. It's a Daytona gray with black interior. Okay. Do you guys have any on in transit on the way? Let's see. And all those, like, that's the most important options to you. Is the sportback black or white? You said black optics. Yeah, the black optic package with the sport package and sport package? Yeah. Is the red interior a must or can you. Yeah, that's another big one. Okay. These are pretty limited. We can't really order too many of them with the red interior because they're pretty specific. Right. I've been following around and I can't really find any stuff. Yeah, we're also in that part. Prospect of like probably switching to 2024s, to my understanding. So everything that's out there right now on the ground is pretty much all that's kind of remaining of just. I think, to my understanding, all that's remaining of the [DATE_INTERVAL] line. So basically, like, if you're looking to get one soon, I would just kind of, no offense. And it's not settling. It's a beautiful car. You're going to love it, right? I know we all want what we want, but truthfully, I would just snag what you can. That's co closest to what you're looking for. Because, I mean, I'm not saying it's not out there. Keep calling, but, I mean, I just. Let's see. Let me see what I have coming in and I'll let you know. So the next one. Yeah, these all got. The rest got canceled. And then the other two that I have are black interior, Kronos gray that's due in [DATE_INTERVAL], and a white one, but this is black in interior. Okay. All right. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, no problem. I'll call you back if I pay mine. Yeah, okay, sounds good. Well, I do have one on the lot, and it's ready to go home today. All right, thank you. Yeah. Good luck.

"[PERSON_NAME] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. How can I help you? Yeah, I have a few questions for you. Regarding what? As to whether or not I can answer them. Yep. Disregarding basically what. What happens if I return a car that is leased out? Did you lease it from here? Yes, that's correct, ma' am. Okay, who was your [OCCUPATION]? I don't remember. Okay, well, let me try and get you to one of them so that they can help you. Good afternoon. It's [PERSON_NAME]. And who am I speaking with? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], how's it going? This is [PERSON_NAME]. I just have a few questions for you about my lease. First of all, we've had some recalls on the transmission and then also the airbags. That's not the reason for my decision. I'm just wondering. What. I've never leased the car. I've always bought cars straight out. What if we return the lease? Okay, so you said. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Did you lease your vehicle from us? Yes. Okay, so let me just look up your file here real quick. Okay. All right, Sounds good, man. Yeah, and then I. Another question you're looking up my file is I can sell the car. And basically, does the warranty transfer to the new person or. Couple questions here, [PERSON_NAME]. Let me. Let me look up your foot. Let me look up your file here. Who's. Whose name is the car under? It's either under [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] or [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, so if I search a [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] in our system, there's. Let's see, there's three. What's the address? [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay, that's not under [PERSON_NAME]. I don't see a [PERSON_NAME] in there. Okay, [PERSON_NAME] or [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Yeah, that's correct. So it looks like he just bought this car, like, [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, and it was from [PERSON_NAME], right? No, I'm sorry. [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. It was almost [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. I'm sorry. No, I looked at the wrong screen and said there was an update [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Okay, so you bought it from [PERSON_NAME] last. Last summer. And it's a sportage that you're at, that you're talking about. Yeah, it's the X Pro Prestige. I mean, the car is beautiful, and I'm just wondering what my options are going forward. Okay. If I. If I return at the. It's basically a, you know, a lease, and then just. I don't know if I have to keep the equity. That's what I'm guessing. Or if I can sell it and try to. Yeah, you cannot. You cannot sell it because it's not yours. I, I don't know about that. I looked up the statute. You can sell the car. So. To any, any book. Yeah. Right. So this is where it gets tricky. So you owe money on the car. It's not yours. You. You're telling me a buyer is going to come in and pay off the car and transfer the title and pay taxes on it and then pay you for that? That's where you're. It's just never going to happen. You know what I mean? I mean, obviously you're right. They're not going to pay out the full amount. Right. So if you were to. If you were looking to sell it outright, you would want to buy it out first and then sell it, and then you'd owe money on it. And again, when a buyer comes to buy a car privately, you owe money on it. The buyer is going to want a clean title, and you don't get a clean title until there's no loan on the car. So it is very, very tricky to sell something privately that you owe money on. Understandable. So, yeah, I mean, if you want to return the lease. It's just that my company owes me $[MONEY_AMOUNT] and they're not, they're not paying me out. So it's kind of a conundrum. Okay. And we need [DURATION] cars, and for the price that I'm paying for this very nice car that I want to keep 100% that I can get probably [DURATION], you know, older model cars and I might purchase them from [ORGANIZATION]. To tell you the truth, if you have any vehicles, because I do like this style and even maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] old or [DURATION] years old, sorry I'm driving is, you know, worth purchasing and not going with the X Pro for speed. I was in a bind and I needed a car asap. And you know, this is the highest model that you can get with this portage. Yep, Sounds good. So I think what we need to do, [PERSON_NAME], is schedule an appointment with [PERSON_NAME]. So [PERSON_NAME] your [OCCUPATION], and she can take a look at the buyout on the vehicle and the market value for it. And there's a chance that we could just buy you out. And if there's equity left over, then we cut you a check if. But I mean, it's. It's hard to say without, you know, having the car here pulling up your file. You'd want to schedule that appointment with [PERSON_NAME] because [PERSON_NAME] was your [OCCUPATION]. No. Totally understand. Yeah. This car, I mean, on the street, I mean, everybody. I mean, like [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I could sell this in basically [DURATION] [DURATION], people already asked about it. It's a unique color. It's green and, you know, black. So I'm just wondering, you know, what. You guys. You know, like you said, you got to sit down and figure out a number. Okay. Yeah. Did you. Do you have [PERSON_NAME] contact info? Okay, so. Okay, and you're at [LOCATION] [LOCATION] or. No, that's correct. Okay, I will text you over her desk phone. She's just. She's not in the office today, but you want to get a hold of her and just get. Mm. All right. Sounds good, sir. Yeah. So ever give me a call at my number. Yep. All right. Sounds good. All right. Yeah, and then I. I had a question. One more question for you. So when I originally bought the car, they said I could change my oil myself. And then all of a sudden, I called in, and I was just making sure that, you know, we're using the correct oil, and I'm making the documentation, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, so the warranty won't be void. And then all of a sudden, they said, no, you have to go to either our dealership or you have to go to, like, an instant oil change or wherever you'd have to go for that documentation. They said that your receipts on the oil are just not enough. Is that correct? It was under my. It was under my understanding that you could change your own oil if you saved all your receipts and everything. So I've never heard otherwise from a technical standpoint, but it's just imperative that you make sure you're. You're documenting everything you purchased and to save your receipts. Absolutely. And that's what I've been doing. And I used to change it before you're even supposed to change it. I mean, I know how. How cars. How fickle cars are, especially new ones. Okay. Sounds good, sir. Well, I will let [PERSON_NAME] know you called in. All right, so once you answer, is it a yes or no? I'm. I'm in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], but I've never heard otherwise, that you can't do your own oil. You just have to save your own receipts. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Yes, sir. [OCCUPATION] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], please. I believe his name, [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Can you hold one moment? Okay. All right. Get the most out of every drive, every day from behind the wheel of a [ORGANIZATION] Camry. This midsize sedan is engineered for optimized handling and ride quality. Hello, sir. Hello, [PERSON_NAME]. So, no, this is not [PERSON_NAME]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. It looks like [PERSON_NAME] is out for right now. I think he. Something might have happened to him yesterday. His leg was a little messed up. So I think he might have went to the [OCCUPATION] and he might have told him to rest, but he's not in today. Is there anything I might be able to help you out with? Yeah, I recently got into a vehicle and I don't know what I was getting myself into. And I spoke with my [OCCUPATION] and to get a [DURATION] [DURATION] payoff. And I got it praised at [MONEY_AMOUNT] and some change. I can't remember right now. And I'm trying to see if I could trade that in. I haven't made. I got on the [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and like I said, I don't know what I was getting into. I haven't done my first payment yet. No problem. So let me see what I can do for you here. And you already started talking to [PERSON_NAME]. I just want to check if your information is already in our system. I have bought a Camry there not too long ago, or actually [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Okay, what was your name? It's under [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and it's under [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. See if I can find it. Yeah, because we work with [PERSON_NAME] and that's why I was trying to see if I could get a hold of him like. But you said he was out. Yeah. Let me see what I can do for you. You know, me and [PERSON_NAME] work pretty closely together, so I don't mind taking care of you. Let's see if I can figure out where your information is. Yeah, because I got a high interest rate and you know, I don't have the VIN number on me. But the vehicle is in good condition. It only has 60,000 miles. I got it used here at [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay, no problem. Okay, I think I found the information. Are y' all on [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? That's our old address. Okay, so that's where you were. Yes, yes. Okay, let's see. And. All right, so let me ask you a question. So y' all were looking at trying to trade in that vehicle. What [DURATION] is it? It's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Rogue SV, all wheel drive. SV all wheel drive. Okay. You said you owe [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it? Yes, that's the payoff on it because that's what that time, I guess how much I have left. But I haven't done my first payment yet. Okay. I don't know what I was getting into. And at that day, that day I was kind of like all over the place. I really. I wasn't really, you know, know, focused. I just said, okay, let's go. Yeah, that's understandable. So how much is your payment right now with with that vehicle? [MONEY_AMOUNT] and [MONEY_AMOUNT]. $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And that's for how long? That is for, I believe, [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. All right, let me see what I can do now. Is there any way you might be able to come on in tomorrow and we can take a look at the Rogue and see what we can do for you value wise? I could try. What time do you have post tomorrow at [TIME]? [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. Okay. Yeah. My [MARITAL_STATUS] gets off at [TIME]. She's driving the road. Okay, so what about on Saturday? Would y' all be available? Saturday? She works this Saturday. So do I. Okay. All right. What about this evening? I could try. Like. Like I said, she gets up at [TIME] and I'm at work right now and I know it's gonna be kind of late to get there and I'm parking be party. If I do come in this evening, it will be, you know, cutting it short with y' all. So. But like I said, I spoke with my. One of my relatives and he used to be a [OCCUPATION] in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] at. Okay. That [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I believe. Okay. And he goes, I mean, you will be upside down, but with that payoff, you would. You wouldn't be negative that much, you know, because I spoke with the girl earlier. She said, yeah, with this amount of money, you'll probably be paying the same as much as a new Camry. Because I'm looking for either a new Camry or a Highlander. Okay. No, but she goes with that, you know, with that kind of no money down, you'll probably, you know, with all this negative equity, you'll probably paying the same amount as you're paying right now for the Rogue. So I'm like, oh, man. Got it. Because I'm trying to. Huh? Yeah, I can always see what we can do. But I honestly need to be able to take a look at the Rogue itself to see the condition. Because like you said, you know, being a [DATE_INTERVAL], it having miles on it, things of that nature, I'd have to look at it to make sure of the condition. And then we could always work from there, see what we can do. Because I checked the Carfax there when I was there at the dealership and it was a one owner. This lady bought it in [LOCATION]. Some [LOCATION], I believe so. So, yeah. So, man, I'm trying to think of a good time. What time works best for y' all, man, I'm trying to see what I could do to help y' all out. Oh, man, like I said, she gets up at [TIME]. By the time she gets home, probably [TIME], [TIME] with her maybe. Okay. How long would it take just to get it appraised, you know, just to start looking. I know you are closing [TIME]. Yeah. Usually it takes around, I'd say between [DURATION] [DURATION] to [DURATION] [DURATION], depending on the situation, so. Depending on condition and things of that nature. Because we shop that information around to all of our dealerships under our umbrella to see exactly how much we can get for the rogue. And whoever gives us the most ends up getting the vehicle. Does that make any sense? So, because we are part of a larger auto group, so we try our best to make sure that we can take care of our customers in that regard. But, yeah, I have no problem seeing what I can do for y' all if y' all can make it in either tonight or tomorrow morning. Tomorrow evening, I should say. Uh huh. Yeah. Because like he was saying too. What was he saying earlier? I just had a great part right now. He said something about that [ORGANIZATION] works with, you know, with credit. When I went in, my credit was okay. So it's. That's what that thing and the finance. Get. [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] there at [ORGANIZATION] said, you know, you're getting this pin because your credit is not really good. Mm. So. And like I said, my cousin said, you know, [ORGANIZATION] works real good with people that have low credit. And I went in there with [ORGANIZATION], with [ORGANIZATION], when I got the camera with no money down. Okay, so. But he goes, you probably not might need, you know, anywhere from a [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] put down just to cover a little bit of that equity. Yeah, man. So I honestly can't give you numbers because I have to see the whole picture. I wouldn't want to. I wouldn't want to set you up for failure in that regard, if that makes any sense. I don't want to tell you something and it turns out not being that way. So I would much rather take a look at all the factors and see what we can do to be able to help you all out. And like I said, we should be able to do that for you guys. I don't think that will be difficult to accomplish. We would basically just look at the trade and we would look at your situation and see what we can do to work with that. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's good. Because, I mean, like I said, I mean, that [MONEY_AMOUNT] payment, I'm like, oh, man, I really don't want to be paying that much. Yeah, I completely understand, man. A [DURATION] [DURATION] old vehicle, you know, it's still new, but it's still kind of [DURATION] [DURATION]. I'm like, yeah, okay. Yeah, let me. Let me get with my [MARITAL_STATUS] and see what time she gets off and I could try to get it. The vehicle praise and we'll. I. I guess we'll work from there. No problem at all, man. So what I'll do is I'll be ready for y' all this evening. I'm going to text you in just a little bit so that way we can stay in contact. And if anything's changed and she needs to come in tomorrow, then no problem. But we'll go ahead and work with you either way. Okay, But I'll go ahead and do it for this evening. Okay, sounds good. Your name is [PERSON_NAME], correct? Yes, sir. Okay, sounds good. I'll be looking forward to hearing from you. All right. No problem at all, man. I definitely appreciate you calling in, and I know I'll work as hard as possible to get you into another vehicle. All right. Okay, sounds good. Appreciate it. All right. Anytime. Thank you.

What was your name? I can transfer you. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, one moment. Thank you. All right, thanks. Good afternoon. Thank you for calling. [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME], how can I help you? Hey [PERSON_NAME], how are you? I'm good. How about yourself? I'm doing pretty good, thank you. I was calling about vans. Do you have any, any vans that are set up like a camper that are used? Sure, yeah, let me go, let's see, let me get in my inventory here. [ORGANIZATION] used you said. Correct. All right, guys do a lease or a lease return? No, usually we do trade inside and sometimes we do purchases. Like sometimes we'll call people and say, hey, you know what, you bought something from us [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, are you still using it? If not, we want to buy it back to you just so we can have some pre owned inventory. What are you looking for? Well, like a sprinter van, you know, let's say 18ft long, set up as a camper. Okay, let's see, on the sprinter I'm showing 1, 2, 3. This is more of a class C. I'm showing 4 on the sprinter platform. And what did the prices range on Those least expensive one, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Most expensive one, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to help a friend of mine and he's given me a budget so far of [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that's what I'm trying to work. Okay, does it have to be a sprinter? No, not necessarily, but a good quality van. Okay, give me two seconds here. Let me, let me rearrange my search here just for a [MARITAL_STATUS] person. He is a [MARITAL_STATUS] person, yes. Okay, so we're not, we're. There's no kids? No. No kids, no. He's got grandkids, but his kids, his kids are all grown, but he has grandkids that are young. Okay, so in the state of [LOCATION], least expensive one that we've got [MONEY_AMOUNT], that would be a [ORGANIZATION] Rise 18M. If you're looking at kind of something that's like a happy medium between like affordable and a Quality unit. There's one that's called an Active loft. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] for [MONEY_AMOUNT] that's available. How many miles does that have on it? The Active has 24,000 miles on it. Okay. So that's reasonable. Yeah, it's the [DATE_INTERVAL]. So kind of how it works is like, you know, on our cars we're putting maybe 15, 20,000 miles on it each year. This is gonna be a lot less because they're just not used as much. As far as the stuff that we've got here. Excuse me. As far as the stuff that we've got here, there is a really nice travato here that would be great for one person. That the [DATE_INTERVAL] with about 11,000 miles on it for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Those are like a win. That's a Winnebago. So that thing is filled like a tank. Okay. Yeah. So we've got, we've got stuff available. It might be a little bit more than what you wanted to spend, but you can finance these things as long as you've got pretty decent credit. You know, if you wanted to explore that option. That option is always there. Yeah. He, he is the beneficiary of a father that passed away and left his estate. So he has about a [MONEY_AMOUNT] that he inherited. So he's gonna pay cash. Okay. So if you're looking at something that, you know, maybe long term use, a sprinter might be a more viable option. I would suggest maybe something a little bit bigger than just a van. We do have them here like a class C. That would just afford him some more space and more storage. And those, those are about the same price. Yeah. I think he lives in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] area. Do you know anything about [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? And then really he kind of lives off, off the grid, if you will. It's 40 acres in the, in the hills. Okay. I think I'm trying to stay away from the classy and go to something like a regular van. I think he's even looking for four wheel drive. Okay. So if he's looking for four wheel drive, it's going to be a lot more money than [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. I think the least expensive used one we have right now is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But the least expensive new one that we've got, that's a four wheel drive. Let me see here is like [MONEY_AMOUNT], I think [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Let me see if I can find it. Hold on one second. Yeah. [MONEY_AMOUNT] for a four wheel drive Rebel, which is set up like that. Okay. Yeah. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I'm the class [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] here for the [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]. So if we show up at the location, you have these to look at, we can ask for you. Yes, sir. Except for on Thursdays and Fridays. Those are my daughters. Those Thursdays. And private. My days off. Okay. Let me see what I can do. All right. Thank you. You want to take my. Do you want to take my personal cell so you can call me directly? Can you send it to my text? I don't have a way to write right now. Yeah, absolutely. What's your number? This is my. This is my cell phone. Do you see the number? [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Got it. All right.

"Yes. Do you have any Odyssey XLS in stock? Give me one second. No, we only have Elite. You only have Elite? The Elite, yeah, the Elite. Are you getting any Excels in? Yes, give me one second. I'm gonna check right now. All right, One second. Yeah, it. With exl, right? That's the one that you're looking for. Yeah, Exo. I have one coming in that's gray and black by maybe by the following [DURATION]. The [DATE]. The [DATE], yeah. Okay. All right, I'll have to come down. I want to. I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] odyssey, which lease is ending, and I want to use that as a trade in. Okay, Give me one second to lease, and you're going to get another lease. Yes, I have. I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. And the payoff is $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. I want to trade that in for a new [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, but you, you lease him with us. No, I'm leasing it. No, I leased it with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, give me one second. I recommend you to come in before the vehicle arrive because there is more than one. But the other ones, they already have, like a down payment on it. That's what customers usually do, you know? Yes, yes, I understand. How much is a down payment? I think [MONEY_AMOUNT] others. Okay, let me. Okay, let me ask you this. How much do you think. How much do you think I could get for my trade in, for that? To be honest with you, I can. We can work on it, like. But I will. I will need, like, your VIN number and all that so I can pass that information over to my [OCCUPATION] so he can check. Well, can you tell me approximately, are we talking about $[MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT] from your. Which vehicle is it that you have? [DATE_INTERVAL] with 20,000 miles on it? The XL. Give me one second. [DATE_INTERVAL], 20,000 miles. Like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] payoff. Give me one second. Okay, I'm gonna ask my [OCCUPATION] real quick. If he says something, I will let you know. Just one second. Okay. Approximately. Okay. Okay, thanks. It's the same situation, [PERSON_NAME]. It's the same situation, but they. The cars that are coming in, people have put deposits. But they have one left. They said they have one left, but it's all the gray with the black inside. What's up? What type. What color is it? Outside, gray. Raise. But they don't know when it's coming in. That's right. Watch out. Using the trip right now, I'm thinking of paying off the [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] and keeping our car. You know what that would seem the simplest, you know, I mean, smartest size. What? You know, all the [OCCUPATION] have the elite, you know that. Hello? Yes, yes, give me one second. I'm going to transfer you over to my [OCCUPATION]. What's your name again, Mr. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] n.1 second. Passport crossover named [ORGANIZATION] [DATE_INTERVAL]. [PERSON_NAME] speaking, how can I help you? Yeah, I was just speaking to one of your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Very nice lady. I. I gave her some particulars. I want to trade in a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] odyssey. $[MONEY_AMOUNT] is the payoff. It's ending a [DURATION] [DURATION] lease and I want to get a new [ORGANIZATION] and I wanted to know approximately how much I can get a new one. I know you have to appraise it and you have to contact [ORGANIZATION] page to verify everything. I'm just trying to figure out whether it would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], approximately. Before I come in, can you. When you say five or [MONEY_AMOUNT], I'm just slightly confused. You mean an equity? Yeah, five. You want to know how much equity you have in your current Odyssey before you come down here to work out numbers on the new Odyssey, I want to have an idea. Sure. How many miles are on the car? I'm sorry? How many? 20,000. The [DATE_INTERVAL] XL Odyssey. 20,000 miles. Payoff of [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You could have anywhere from [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] up to $[MONEY_AMOUNT] in positive equity. Okay. All right. Yeah, I definitely think it's worth it for you because right now the Odyssey's are pretty hot on my used car market. We don't have a lot of them. And we're looking to get our hands on any certified Odyssey we can get our hands on. So when would be a good [DURATION] for you to come in so we could take a real appraisal and work out numbers? To be honest with you, I was up at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. The other [DURATION], okay. And they said, they said they would give me [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right. What were they charging it for the new Odyssey, though? Well, it's all be. To be honest with you, the only Odyssey they had was the Elite, Right. And they were probably about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] over the sticker. He told me that it would cost me [MONEY_AMOUNT] for a 30. So here's the thing. If I'm [MONEY_AMOUNT] in equity, but I'm only [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] over sticker on an Odyssey exl, I'm already beating them, Right. He said that this, the price is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the elite. Yeah. So He's. He's gonna. He's going $[MONEY_AMOUNT] over sticker on an Odyssey Elite. See, I'll do [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] over sticker on the Odyssey Elite, and I'll give you the [MONEY_AMOUNT] in equity. Now I'm beating them. I'm winning, you know, I mean, I'm saving you [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So if I give you [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] in equity and I'm only [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] over sticker on the Elite, we're done. But how much would that cost me [DURATION] [DURATION]? I'm looking less than what he's saying. He said [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So figure $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. You're talking about lowering your payment about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. No, the thing. The thing I'm looking for is to be able to trade in, get a new [ORGANIZATION] and still pay $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] for [DURATION] [DURATION]. Is that possible? So I will say this to you. It's very, very slim chances that that's going to happen because the cars just cost more. So to be at the same payment on something you were. You were paying [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, it's almost. I mean, think about what you paid for Milk [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. You paying that in the store now? No, it's way more. So it's going to be not way more. You'll be in the [MONEY_AMOUNT] on an EXL. I could definitely work the deal out for you, but it's not going to be [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You're going to be slightly more than what you're paying now. I'm looking, okay, looking for as close to even deal as possible. I could bring you here, appraise the car, put you into an ex L for somewhere around [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You know, maybe a little bit less. It depends on, actually when I appraise the vehicle, how much money I can really pull out. Yeah, okay. No, I think you're right. I think I should come down, but I do. I'll say this. What's your name? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. I really appreciate you giving some of this information. So you're telling me he's really making it up on the Elite so he can give me. Going up. My wa [ORGANIZATION] is very small compared to my dealership when it comes to how many cars we sell. So I can definitely be way more aggressive. So they're telling you. And that's the other thing is, I'll tell you, hey, man, I'm going to give you [MONEY_AMOUNT] in equity. It's all hearsay until the vehicle gets here and I appraise it you know, I could tell you [MONEY_AMOUNT], and my [OCCUPATION] may think it's worth [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And I've got more money than we said, so it's definitely worth it because. Two reasons. One, I'm a larger dealership than them, and two, I'm going to have more vehicles. Like, I'll have an exl. It's not here today, but it might be here tomorrow. Well, what do you call. Are you have any relationship to the [ORGANIZATION]? Yeah, that's my sister store. Okay. Because I. That's where I bought my car originally. Yeah, that's okay. [ORGANIZATION]. And [ORGANIZATION] is fine. But yeah, that's my. We call it the little sister store because they're much smaller than we are. But, yeah. All right. I would definitely say what. What's the [DURATION] in time that works for you, sir. So this way I can schedule it to the book, make sure my [OCCUPATION] are ready for you when you get here. Okay. Well, I have to. I'm sure you'll understand. Check with my [MARITAL_STATUS]. Sure. Absolutely. What I'll do is I'll have maybe contact you back in [DURATION] [DURATION] or so and you let her know if there's a time that you guys have available. Okay. So you think I could get pretty much to even. Yeah, I think you're going to get close enough to it for you to be happy. Let me ask you this. That some imposing on your goodwill. Should I keep. Did I keep the last Odyssey I had went to 200,000 miles. I mean, I'm [PERSON_AGE], [PERSON_AGE] years old. In other words, should I just pay off the [MONEY_AMOUNT] cash and keep it? I always tell people, don't buy anything cash, especially depreciating objects. What I would say to do is bring it in. Let me take an appraisal on it. Let's see what the new lease looks like for you. If it's a number that's comfortable, great. We move forward with a new one. If it's not comfortable, then we'll work out you buying the car out and keeping it for a little while until things calm down and the numbers get a little bit more aggressive. It's never a bad idea to buy a [ORGANIZATION] lease because like you said, I mean, my father's got a Ridgeline he leased. I told him, buy it out. Do not trade that thing in. He's got 350,000 miles on the truck, right? Still in his driveway running. You know, he came and leased the Civic for me, but he keeps the Ridgeline because there's nothing wrong with it, it still runs, so it's not a bad idea. But let's try and see if your first idea works. If it doesn't, then we go to plan B. Well, they gave me what he called. I, I called up the credit union and they'll do [DURATION] for 6.7%. Oh, God. I'll be that. I'll do [DURATION]. I'll do [DURATION] [DURATION] and save you at least one point on the interest. Okay, so, you know, I tried to get all the figures. All right, I think your name again, I'm sorry. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And like I said, sir, don't, don't worry. What's your name and phone number just in case you get disconnected? [ORGANIZATION]. Cal 2. I'm sorry, what was your first name? [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Perfect. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Because what I'm saying to you is when you get here, we'll work out appraising it and seeing what it's worth and what the new one looks like. Then I can show you my lease buyout numbers at a better interest rate, lowering the monthly payment for what the credit union told you. So I'll save you money either way. You know, whether you buy your car or you buy a new one, I'm going to save you money. So I'll have maybe give you a call in like [DURATION] [DURATION] or so and you guys try to work out a [DURATION] and time that works for you. And it's definitely going to benefit you to step foot in my dealership and see some real numbers. All right, how, how accurate is your delivery dates? I. I guess people are putting deposits down now. Yeah, so people are putting deposits down the delivery date. So if [ORGANIZATION] tells me, hey, it'll be here on the [DATE] figure, it's going to [DURATION] [DURATION] of that date. So it could be the [DATE], it could be the [DATE]. Why are there, why are there so many Elites left over? Because [ORGANIZATION] is. So what [ORGANIZATION] is doing is they can, they can only produce so many cars. This is the truth. Whatever everybody else tells you is a lie. They're going to produce the ones that generate the most money for them. So when I buy a car from [ORGANIZATION], if it's a base model, they make [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. If it's a top model, they make [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's a higher spread. So they're going to produce the ones that make them the most money, not the ones that make everybody happy. Even with [OCCUPATION], I'm going to have more of the expensive [OCCUPATION] because they're just producing more of them. So everybody's saying, hey, I want a Odyssey exl. And [ORGANIZATION] saying, nope, I'm going to send you all the Elites and the Tourings because we make the most money on those. But no one's buying them. No, no. I mean, look at where we're at right now. The economy is not screaming. I'm not making more money. Are you making more? At the end of the [DURATION], everybody wants more money for stuff, but nobody's getting paid more money. So it's, It's. It's leaving me with Odyssey, Elites, pilot Tourings. Every. Every car that I have in my inventory is like 50,000, 52, 47. None of the cheap cars are sitting here. All the cheaper cars, the less expensive ones are selling quickly. But I have a very good relationship with [ORGANIZATION], so they send me more cars than everybody else. So if I can get to the exl, it'll be quicker. Yeah. [PERSON_NAME], let me ask you. So wouldn't it pay for a [OCCUPATION] to do a tighter deal on the Elite? Just. Yeah, so sometimes I'll get a little bit more aggressive on my more expensive one just to get rid of it, but it still may not fit your budget, you know, like you're trying to be in the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You know, even if I got really aggressive on an elite, low sixes, maybe. Maybe you're going to be low sixes, but you're not going to get into the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I mean, that being said, I can't. I can't predict the future. My [OCCUPATION] loves it. He may. He may give you more money. Yeah, I doubt it. I want to hope for the [ORGANIZATION]. I want to hope for the [ORGANIZATION]. I'm just taking a quick look while I have you on the phone. I want to see. I'm pretty sure I have some Odyssey EXLs coming to me. Let me just see what I have here. I think they said they had one black left. I know I had a black one the other [DURATION] that was inbound. I got two. One black one. That one is treason. I got a gray one that's coming in with black interior. Right. That one has no date on it, so it'll probably be here at the end of the month. And then I have another one that is being built for me. Let me see. That one won't be here until next month, though. Okay. Yeah, but I could definitely. One that'll be here at the end of the month that I could do. Feel on an exl, I can try and get super aggressive on the elite, or we can look into the buying option of the one you have. Either way, once again, like I said, it's a benefit for you to come to this dealership because we're in the business of trying to save you money. You're right. Okay, [PERSON_NAME], I will call back and try to get my [MARITAL_STATUS] to, you know, to give me some kind of answer. Sounds awesome. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you.

It's not a thing in [OCCUPATION] anymore to get off on time. I'm pretty well aware. Right. Oh, no. And so, yeah, so we don't care. I mean, that doesn't matter to us. So just whatever works best for you guys. The, the. And even if you're like, you know what today is? Whatever. You can always. What some people do is they'll just like put a partial payment down on it and say, hey, if we drive this. And it's exactly what we're looking for. We're buying this car and put a partial payment down on them. We put a sold tag in there and nobody can touch it. None of our other dealerships can touch it. And then you say, you know what, tomorrow, Friday afternoon is going to be best. You know, whatever. Again, just whatever works best for you is what we're here to do. So. Okay, now you guys said that you would bring it to us. Do you have a dealership up north here somewhere that I don't know about? No, no. Your driveway, your work. I mean, the other day I was driving up and down [LOCATION] [LOCATION] in [LOCATION] with a guy on a test drive. Like we'll go anywhere. Yeah, no, that doesn't matter. Yeah, yeah. I did not know that was okay. Oh, yeah. Do you guys have a trade in or anything? I do not, no. The vehicle that we have. Yeah, the vehicle that we have, it's just an older vehicle and it's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] pickup. So we're just gonna keep it. It's still running, you know, but it's. Yeah, it's got worth more to you than it would be to trade it or something. Yeah, it's gonna pro. Probably be my niece's [PERSON_AGE] birthday car in a year, so. Type of thing. Oh, nice. Yeah, I love it. She's probably gonna do something like that for her and get him a new truck. So that's probably what we're gonna do. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, so he is super interested in this. I just want to make sure that by the time we get down there, it's not sold type of thing. That's the only thing I'm worried about is I don't want somebody to come and steal it from under him. That's all I'm worried about. Right, right. And it's. I mean, we can basically say what? And I am so sorry. What is your name? My name's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Your name? I didn't get that. I'm [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. All right, [PERSON_NAME]. We can. You know, there's been [DURATION] [DURATION] I just looking on here and this. First of all, [DURATION] [DURATION] things about [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Have you ever worked with us before [ORGANIZATION] or anything? No, no, no. Okay, so [DURATION] [DURATION] things just so you know is we are completely upfront pricing. We are one point of contact. It's the price of the car is the price of the car. We don't add on any [OCCUPATION] documentation fees or, you know, some of the stuff that these other dealerships do. That also being said is the price of the car is the price of car if we don't negotiate, you know, so it would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT] is the price of this truck. And from there it's pretty simple. You know, as long as you guys are good with it and everything. I mean, we can even do everything over the Internet, you know what I'm saying? I mean, obviously you guys got to drive it and all that, but we try and make it pretty darn simple where you're not getting under the heat lamp with some guy in [OCCUPATION] asking you about, you know, a bunch of other stuff. Oh gosh, that would be awesome. Yeah. So now that will be me. I will put you under the heat lamp. No, I'm kidding. But there is, there is with, with all these vehicles. It does. These vehicles come with a [DURATION] [DURATION], 3,000 mile warranty from us from [ORGANIZATION]. And, and then you also have a [DURATION] [DURATION], 700 mile return policy. For any reason you decide this isn't the one, then you can always bring back to us and everything. And then, and then we do go over. I mean there's ways to extend the warranty if you want it longer than [DURATION] [DURATION], 3,000 miles and all that kind of stuff. So we have to go over that. But it's just me and I'm a pretty simple guy. So. Awesome. Now will you be there after [TIME] tonight then? You know, I. Normally not. I will do everything I absolutely can to be my [MARITAL_STATUS] from [LOCATION], which sounds really weird and sketchy, but I lived there for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. She is in town and I am off at [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] tonight. But no problem. I get that. I understand. Yeah. No, so, but, and, but she also understands life is life and I want to be able to help you guys. So I will do everything absolutely that I can to be here unless it hits the fan and I cannot then any one of my colleagues can help you out, you know. Okay. But yeah, I will plan to be here for you. No problem. Okay, perfect. So nobody's going to come in and purchase it. You guys will hold it for me until I get there tonight to buy it. The. I will do everything that I can. Typically, typically what happens is we have you put down a partial payment, but you're going to be here later today. So what I'll do is. What are you looking At. For a partial payment. What happens if I hate it? No, no. And you're not going to be out. What I'm going to do is I'm just going to put it out there that this is sold that you're coming in. I mean, sounds like everything is on the up and up on this. And then so nobody can touch it. We've got an appointment tonight about [TIME] [TIME] [TIME], and we're good. Don't worry about that. If you were going to come in on like, Friday, it would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT] that you would need to put down. Oh, gosh. My [MARITAL_STATUS] wouldn't let me wait that long. He would not. Well. Oh, I just, I mean, even if it's, if it's within [DURATION] [DURATION], basically that's where we say we got to have a partial payment behind it. But if you're, if you're coming in later today, you don't. You're, you're, you're, you're fine. Perfect. Okay, great. So. And you guys will accept a personal check, too? Oh, absolutely. And you make it out [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], right? Yeah. Oh, yeah. With an extra tip. Yeah. Right. I understand. Oh, that's so funny. Oh, I love it. Well, perfect. And [PERSON_NAME], what is your last name, [PERSON_NAME]? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And that ends like [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, perfect. All right, [PERSON_NAME]. Well, I am going to. I'm just going to put you in the system and get an appointment on here and then just go let my [OCCUPATION] and everybody know, like, that one is in, in all theory, that one is gone. And then is there any information? Have you guys done some research on, like, have you looked into the Carfax? Can I send you any of that or. Yeah, you sure could. That would be awesome. I haven't done any of the Carfax stuff yet. I assume my bank already pulled it. But I did see online that it had a clean one. But she. I don't know if you guys need my bank info too, but I can give you my bank contact gal. My [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] that I've been speaking with who always gets all that stuff. Good to go for me. But she told me he, you want to write a personal check, I'll just wire the money in your account, too. So I was like, that's fine. Whatever you guys want to do. So they're pretty good to work with. She's been dealing with me for like [DURATION] [DURATION] trying to find a truck for my [MARITAL_STATUS]. So he's pretty on the ball. I love it. Well, yeah, if there's a, if there's a good email address, I can just email you over all the information that [ORGANIZATION] and you know, original window sticker and you know, all that kind of stuff, if that helps. Yes, yes, that would be great. Let's do [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] for my first name, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [PERSON_NAME]. All right, perfect. I've got and is in [PERSON_NAME] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Yes, that is correct. All right, perfect. Well, I'm gonna send this right over to you and then we'll plan on seeing and it'll have all my contact information in case anything comes up, anything changes, whatnot. You'll know how to get a hold of me. But we'll plan on seeing you around, around [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. Perfect. Thank you so much, [PERSON_NAME]. I appreciate it. Right? Hey, absolutely. Thank you. Have a good rest of your day. All right. Hey, thank you. You too. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",success,inventory_check,1500 Bighorn,high,False,00d9dfff681242cd837581b6fcb66798_transcript.json
"Our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] are available from [TIME] to [TIME] Tuesday through. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME], who do I have a pleasure speaking with. Hi, [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How are you? Good, [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you today? So as you're aware, coming up on the [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] the lease, I got an email, I think it was from you, said that you're going to do a CPO at no charge. Yes, we are offering those right now. Absolutely. Are you thinking about keeping the car then? Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah. Yes, yes. You're so sure about. No, I'm so torn. Right. Because it's ridiculous. There's less. There's literally 3,000 miles on the car. Oh my gosh. Okay. Right, right. And so I sit back and I go, okay, listen, you know, I've. We've paid $[MONEY_AMOUNT] or whatever we paid right. In [DURATION] [DURATION] for 3,000 miles. I just can't, I can't just walk away from this thing. So, you know, [PERSON_NAME] trying to figure out like warranty. It's out of warranty at the [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DURATION] [DURATION], right? [DURATION] [DURATION] for [ORGANIZATION]. Oh, it's [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. Well that, that, that buys me a little peace of mind. Time to try and decide, you know, do we buy an extended. Do we sit with it? Do we, does she change vehicles? She loves to change vehicles. You may or may not remember. But so anyway, so I guess there's two questions I've got for cpo. Does she need to like, does it take hours of time? Do we need to drop it off and come get it another day? Or is this like an oil change? Nope, It's a pretty intensive inspection to make sure that the vehicle would qualify. So basically what we'd be doing is if I were to buy this car for my inventory, I'd be doing a certified pre owned inspection on the car. If it qualifies, I'd be making it a certified pre owned [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and turning around and selling it to my client. Right. But what we're doing for our clients who would like to purchase their vehicles, because it is a kind of a unique time as well. Right? I mean, even if you didn't have super low miles on it, we've had so many people just buy out their lease because they're looking at the new car. The new car's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. You're like, yeah, but for that, my current lease payment is, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And now the lease payment is [MONEY_AMOUNT] is like, that doesn't work for Me, why would I do that? For the same car almost. Right. And so what are the opportunities to keep that car but, but stay risk free, basically. So [ORGANIZATION] certainly has an investment in the dealerships to make sure that they don't want the cars back either. I don't know why, because they could make some money on them right now, but they don't want them back either. So they want us to make sure that we're facilitating whatever our customers decide. So here's the deal. If I do a certified pre owned inspection on the car, I'm probably going to need it maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] to do that. So that can be dropped off at any time for us to do that. Once I do the certified inspection, then I'm assuming it's not going to need tires based on how many miles you have on the vehicle, et cetera. Now you still have [DURATION] [DURATION] of warranty left from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], but if it passes the CPO inspection, which I expect it should, unless you've had a big accident on it, then you have the option, I think it's only like maybe [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] to certify the car to have it be an extra [DURATION] of warranty on top of that one that you have left. And that would also give it unlimited miles. So if your lifestyle changes a little bit or you know what, you got another family member that's going to drive it or whatever, then you can do that too and you get an unlimited mile warranty on it. So that's why we're offering the inspection for free, because most of our clients are taking advantage of that, saying, yes, I'm buying a car, I want more than [DURATION] [DURATION] of warranty on it, right? Because I'll probably have a car. So now yours is due in [DATE_INTERVAL] if I recall correctly. And so in order for us to do the certified inspection, we have to have made that decision that one, you're going to buy the car to keep it, and two, we're doing it now because technically I have to buy the car. Our dealership has to buy it from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], do the inspection and then turn around and sell it back to you for that same price, by the way. So there's no markup or anything like that, right? I'm just selling it to you to what your current payoff is. So the reason I bring that up is because right now your current payoff probably reflects that you have another payment that's still due. Who cares? One way or the other, you're making it right? It really just depends on whether you want to do it now, whether you want to do it in [DATE_INTERVAL], so to speak. And so that's really kind of the logistics of it. I buy the car from [ORGANIZATION], I turn around and sell it to you the next day or sometimes same day, whatever. And then we will also process your paperwork. So send it to the [ORGANIZATION] and do all of that. There's still no doc fees or anything with us. And so it really is extremely convenient for our clients for us to handle that for them and we collect your taxes and just do it all. When would you like to do that? Yeah, I'll have to ask her, but I'm just driving home now, so I can ask her and then text. I can text you at this number, right? Like you've texted me. Oh, yeah. And so, yeah, let me. I don't know if it's a phone number or not, but yeah, yeah, that sounds right. Yep. Yep. You can text me there as well. Go ahead. A [DURATION] [DURATION] other questions. Sure. I see three questions. We still need another service. I think we bought three oil changes. Would you suggest us waiting more into near the buyout to do that or should we schedule everything all at once? Potentially both. So one of the things that the certified inspection is going to require us to do is make sure that the vehicle is current on its services. And so if it is due for a service within [DURATION] [DURATION], we'd have to do that. So. And since you've already got that paid for, we'd probably just use that. We probably want to schedule that right before and have you use your maintenance to do that so that that's not putting a kink in anything. Does that make sense? And I just did this with another client. He scheduled. He did his oil change like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] before we did the certified inspection just so that he could get that done. Since he's already paid for it, it's like, yep, let's piece of that. Let's get it done and move on. So again, this is really kind of goes back to you, [PERSON_NAME], on what' if you don't care if it's done a little bit early, fine, bring it in. You know, let's do it in [DATE_INTERVAL] or kind of whatever. Or if you want to wait till [DATE_INTERVAL] to do it in [DATE_INTERVAL] and kind of do it all at the same time, that also works. I don't know that it really matters, you know, to us either direction. Again, I'm just here to. I know that we bought it on [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE], so does that mean [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE] is when the lease is over or is there another payment due [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE]? Well, I guess not because we pay [DATE] and last when you start a lease. Correct, correct. You pay for your payment. Sorry. For the next [DURATION] up front. But I am also logging into [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and I'm plugging in your VIN number to get you that for sure. And so I think your last payment would have been. Will be paid on the [DATE] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay. So we also have a [DURATION] [DURATION] safety recalls. I think I've seen those. So we can probably have that done at the same time that you have the car. Yeah, I do have a question about the car, though. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. So I do have a question about the car. So you're going to. Absolutely. We obviously you can tell we rarely drive the car or she rarely drives the car and it usually is to church and to special functions that she takes it. Right. But we're always getting emails from [ORGANIZATION] saying that battery monitor warning, you need to drive it longer. Right. This is hard on the battery or whatever. Is that just a general warning or is it telling me there's something wrong with your battery? Yeah, so it's telling you that the reading on your battery is low and that you need to get out and drive it because kind of like, you know, they talk about when you charge your phone, how often you should charge it, how long the battery lasts, things like that. They're all kind of relevant. And so that might be something, to be honest, I would discuss with one of the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] in your career, ask them more about it to understand it better, because then maybe you can just coordinate to say, hey, well, I'm going to intentionally take this on one of our trips once a [DURATION] where we go to [LOCATION]. [LOCATION] or where we do whatever and get some miles on it to keep the car in working order. So that on those days that you do want to use it, you go out there and. Yeah. Fires. Right. You have no problems. Right. So I would recommend that. So I am showing that you do have one more payment left on the vehicle that will be due on the [DATE]. And then it says, currently your payoff today for the dealership because I don't have to collect taxes yet, is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So to that [MONEY_AMOUNT], then we'd be adding taxes if you make one more payment. And I suspect I probably couldn't get this car in fast enough to get your oil change and CPO and stuff. Anyway, you're probably going to make your next payment on the [DATE] anyway. And then I'd say let's start working on trying to get the car in the shop to get your oil change and your recalls and stuff like that up to date so that then we can buy the car maybe [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] or [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] as well, and flip that to you and. And convert your lease to a purchase. Okay, so I will reach out to one of my [OCCUPATION] regarding an appointment for you, but go ahead. Are there, are there special rates that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] offers like. I don't particularly want to write a [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] check. Yep. Currently for this [DURATION], I don't have anything on a gle. I probably haven't had anything on a gle, but instead the other thing that we could do is just do financing to a [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] or whoever you want. So if you're like, well, let's just convert this to a loan. I'll put $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down. Let's finance whatever. Then when we're close to that, I'd have you just do the application and then we'll pull it open and see who's got the best terms available. Right. Because that's mostly what people want. I can do that online easily. That's not a worry. I was just going to say for me to sell it to you, we'd be processing that too. So again, there's no cost to you for us figuring out which credit union, whatever's got the lowest or you just tell me. [PERSON_NAME], I'm totally [MARITAL_STATUS] to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I want to use [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Fine, we'll send it to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. There's still no cost. You get yours customer rate with them anyway. But we just have to secure that part for you as well. And again, it's no cost. Easy. One more. What do you think the value of the vehicle is? Oh, my word. Definitely higher than that. Residual. So without looking at specifics for what your car has as far as features, it's a [DATE_INTERVAL], correct? I think that sounds right. I think I have a GLE in stock now. I think is a [DATE_INTERVAL], and it has 42,000 miles on it and it's certified and we're asking [MONEY_AMOUNT] or, sorry, [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So for a [DATE_INTERVAL], again, maybe if it's similarly equipped but with really super low miles. Am I probably mid to upper 40s maybe. Okay. If you were trying to replace that car with something similar, that's what you'd be paying for it. And that's really what we've been finding in the last [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] anyway is that the residual values were low enough. You paid enough depreciation that at this point you're like, well, I can't replace this car anywhere near what I could pay for it. Right. I think I'll take it. So. Okay, wonderful. Well, I'll just wait to hear from, I guess, one of your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] or [OCCUPATION]. Yep. See if we can get the appointment going for you. Yeah, I gotcha. All right. Thanks so much. Sounds great. All right, thanks. Take care. Bye. Bye.",success,general_inquiry,unknown,medium,True,00e1b1202e404d29a901fa5953d39041_transcript.json

Then watch for your appointment confirmation and courtesy reminders via email. Thanks for holding. This is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], hey, [PERSON_NAME] sent me over to you. I had an inquiry on looking at your [ORGANIZATION] 2500. Sure, yeah, yeah, and just get some questions. I've never had a diesel truck. Okay. I just talked to a guy in town. I'm over in [LOCATION]. Okay. But I was Just talking to a guy here that has a gas and loves it, has plenty of towing power. My use is it'll be my daily driver most of the time. And then I'm really only pulling like a skid steer that I've got around my own farm and occasionally to my dad's, which is like [DURATION] [DURATION] away. So I'm not using it for like daily, you know, real heavy hauling or campers or boats or whatever else. So wondering if gas is. Is sufficient, what the fuel economy difference is, if it's worth going diesel retail, if it's worth going diesel, winter, not worth going diesel, whatever. I don't know. Yeah, a diesel resale is definitely going to be better than gas. That I can tell you, hands down, because like, if you were. If you were to build one, [PERSON_NAME], it's going to be like an extra [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the diesel. Okay. Yep. It's going to cost an extra [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the diesel motor versus the gas engine. So. So. And as far as pulling power, I mean, do you pull a lot or. No, no, hardly at all. I mean, I'll just occasionally be pulling a skid steer and a tractor, but they're not real, you know, not crazy. Okay. Because if you're really pulling a lot, then I would say go diesel because diesel is going to give you the torque, you know. Yep. But if you're not really pulling that much, then you probably wouldn't need to. But like I said, I mean, resale value, diesel is going to be the answer to that. But if that doesn't mean that much to you as well, then I would definitely go gas. Okay. Gas, Gas, Go ahead. How is the difference in fuel efficiency versus cost of fuel and that stuff, or is it not a big deal? I can actually tell you. Let me pull. I have some of those statistics up here. Let me pull those up here. I can kind of give you fuel economy, gas versus diesel. And I can tell you like towing capacity too. Said tow the same, but I'll just double check just to, just to make sure here. All right. You said you're over in [LOCATION]? Yeah. Yep. Oh, okay. Let's see here is [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Do you guys. Are you guys like, do you get most of your stuff off leases or do you do new deal? Are you guys new dealerships also? Yeah, we're new too. Yeah, we have, we have new. We have new vehicles on one side of the lot and the other side of the lot is all pre owned. Gotcha. Okay. Are you guys a [ORGANIZATION] dealership? Yep. Correct. Okay. Gotcha let's see here. Okay, here we go. Specifications. All right, so horsepower and torque, let's see here. Yeah, 400 horse, 401 horse, 464 foot pound of torque. Let's see here. That for diesel, that just gives me a general. I was hoping it would break it down for me, gas versus diesel, but it doesn't. Let's see here. That doesn't break it down for me. I was kind of hoping it would see here. Towing. I know will tell me. Let me see. Okay, so towing capacity, four wheel drive, crew cab, standard bed. Okay. So The V, the 6, 6 turbo diesel is going to tow 18,005. Okay. If you went with the gas, it's 14.5. So you do get 4,000 more pounds on a diesel. Okay, let me see here and let me check one thing here. Okay. So on the looks like 12 and [DURATION] [DURATION] miles per gallon on the diesel. So the gas is probably going to, I would say they're probably going to be pretty, see. Oh, I take that back. I read that wrong. So 12 and [DURATION] [DURATION] on gas, diesel is going to be about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So now that's, now you got to remember, just so you know, that's what [ORGANIZATION] is telling me. So. Okay. Yeah. Okay. How long with the diesel, how long does it take to warm up and stuff in the winter? I mean, I've never had a diesel truck before. Oh, you've never owned a diesel before? Most guys, like if I have a customer coming in, [PERSON_NAME], that I know is gonna, wants to come in for a test drive, I'll usually leave it up, leave it running for [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION], sometimes [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] before just to warm everything up, you know, because the best, with a diesel truck, the best thing to do is to run those things hot. They're not good for short trips, they're good for longer hauls, longer trips. Okay. Like if you're just running down the road, five, six miles down the road, you know, it's not going to get that hot. Okay. And those things that you want the best, best outcome of a diesel, you got to run those things hot. You know, it's been made for 50, 60 mile trips, you know, that kind of thing. How far is your commute every day? I work out of my house most days, but when I do it's only 10 miles, 8 miles. Okay. Okay. And most of my driving, that's what most of my driving probably is. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So there's a little bit more upkeep with the diesel. You know, you gotta change the Fuel filters you gotta have. You gotta add def. Def fluid. Diesel exhaust fluid. That's got to get added, you know, Most guys, usually, they'll check at every oil change. Most guys, though, you can go, you know, six to 8,000 miles before you gotta add more. [PERSON_NAME], your phone's tougher here. All right. Does the AT4 gas that you guys have, is that a moon rough or. No, [PERSON_NAME], your water. What's that? You got an at 4. I think it was gas. Does that have a moon roof? Do you know? I'll check. Do you, by any chance have a stock number? Let me see if any of the text messages had that. Sure. Was it new or used? It was used. I think it was a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay. Was probably certified then, too. It was [ORGANIZATION], right? Yeah. Okay, let's see. I got 6.6. Yeah, 6.6. I couldn't tell the pictures. There wasn't a picture of it. But I thought all the AT4s had moon roofs. But I don't know that for sure. Oh, it was an at 4. Okay, that helps. Yeah. Okay, so. Because I got 84s or Denalis. Okay, so I got a red one and I got three black ones. Okay, so it wasn't a red one, right? No. Okay, so how many. Remember how many miles were on it? I think it was this one with 7,400 miles. Okay. Yep. So I'm. Got it. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] was the price. Yep. Okay, perfect. I got it. I'm clicking on it right now, so my computer definitely thinks it's a Monday because it's a little slow today here. No, that's. What. Okay. That's the gas. Okay. Yep. And what were you wondering about? If it had a moon roof? Yeah. Let me see. Once here. Because usually they'll take a picture of the moon roof if it has a moon roof. Yeah, the one into the cab looks like it has one, but it's not open. And I noticed on the other trucks, the pictures had the moon roof open, so I didn't know if it did for sure or not. It's hard to tell. Okay, let me take a look at some of these inside pictures once, because that should tell me. Yeah. It doesn't look like it has it. I mean, that you want a moon roof. Yeah. Yep. Yes, you do. Okay. So the other. I prefer it. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe just check when we're done if you can. And whatever. I can give you my contact info. You can just text me or whatever. Yeah. Actually, I guess my only other question is, it sounds like you get a lot of these GMCS in. Do you guys get. Or do you know if you have any charcoal ones coming in the gray ones? I'd have to ask [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] is my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], so he's the one that gets. Gets all these things. So yeah, I like him in the charcoal. Both are kind of. Kind of a little fire. More fired up about the charcoal, but. Okay. So that's what you prefer, the black or the charcoal? Yeah. Yep. Okay. And what I really want to do is that the 2500 has a little bit of a lift to. It doesn't. Or it sits higher than the 1500. Yep. Correct or no? Yes. Well, the. The 1500 [PERSON_NAME] has. Does have a two inch factory lift on the AT4. Okay. Yep. But the 2500. Anyway. Okay. Yeah, sounds good. Could a guy. What I kind of want to do. I love the AT4. The off road version that they have. Yeah. On the 1500. I mean it just looks so stinking beastly. So I. I'd be. What I do in the future is probably get some aftermarket stuff on this to try to give it that look a little bit of that. Whatever that off road version is that they have on the. But the charcoal one is super, super cool. I don't know if you want to just check with them to see if you have any of those going. And then I got a. I got a [MONEY_AMOUNT] Wrangler Unlimited that I'd maybe trade. I'll either sell it or else I'll potentially trade it and at least see what you guys would give me for it. Sure. So whoever I talk to about that, I can text a couple pictures. It's really clean. It's got a lift and fox shocks and all the aftermarket stuff that you could put on. It's really sharp truck. Okay. Yeah, we would definitely take it. For sure. I would just need the VIN from you and then the. A picture of the odometer and then just some basic, you know, inside and outside pictures. Okay. Let me give you my email. Can you just text me. Can you just email me what you need and then I'll throw something together? Yeah, absolutely. I can. What's your. What's your email, [PERSON_NAME]? And that's. Okay. Perfect. Yeah, I'll text. I'll not text you. I'll. I'll email you that information. I'm looking at the build through [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] on that truck and it does not have a sunroof or moon roof. Okay. Huh. That's interesting. [OCCUPATION]. Yeah. All right, Sounds good. Do Most of the AT4s have it or is that just an option? You can either pick or not pick. Correct. It's an option. Okay. All right. Okay, sounds good. I think. I mean, am I crazy thinking that maybe gas is more suitable for me or. No, I think so. No, I definitely think so. You know, hearing what you're going to be using it for and yeah, I think gas would probably be your best bet. Okay. And do I save that [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] on the resale on buying one used or are they all kind of pretty similar used wise? Let me just take a peek here. Yeah, used wise, they're all going to be right around that same price. The diesel will be a little bit more. Let's see here. Yeah, the diesels. The diesels are about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] more used, so. Okay. Yeah. All right, well, I don't think I'd go wrong doing a diesel. I think it'd be fine too, so. All right. Yeah, if you want to shoot me that stuff, I'll get you some info on my jeep once I get back around to it. And then, yeah, if you can ask your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] too, if you think you have any charcoal ones coming in, any of the gray ones. Yeah, he's on vacation. He's on vacation today in tomorrow, but he'll be back in on Wednesday, so. Okay, yeah, no sweat. I'm not in a huge hurry. I'm just. Okay. Kind of tired of the bumpiness of my jeep, so. Yeah, okay, yeah, I'll shoot that information over to you, [PERSON_NAME], and then. Yeah, not a problem. And then when Wednesday comes around, I'll talk to [PERSON_NAME]. Perfect. Okay. All right.

I actually think it's a little bit heavier and I'm thinking so. Yeah, see, I think it's closer. Just over four, I think. GVWR £5,700. So where are we? Yeah, I missed the grow. So that's fully loaded. So something's telling me it's gonna be about 42 then or something like that. That's kind of what I'm guessing it's like to be like to be accurate, but it's probably going to be in that.

What's going on? Yeah, I called a couple of times, but it didn't. I mean, I don't know if you got the message or not. Did you? Pretty good. You were calling my cell or my, my desk. Yeah, I call your cell phone, the one you gave me. Oh yeah, I was probably outside. Yeah, I apologize. I was my, my office number. Okay, so I got your link and everything. Now the question I have. Did you figure out the, the total, total price? The out the door total price? Yeah. No, not yet. So I handed it over to one of my [OCCUPATION]. Do you for like. You mean like your monthly payment is that we're trying to get. Well, I gave you all the information. Remember I said I'm going to put $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down. Right, right. I have [MONEY_AMOUNT] and you're gonna give me the credit of [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus another [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then I just wanted to find out what was the outdoor price. I'm putting $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down. So I want to know what the monthly payment going to be. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION], 12,000 miles. And I have another question. The [VEHICLE_ID], like [PERSON_NAME], what is, what vehicle is this? Where does it show that? That's just like the model code. They all have that like. I'm not sure if you're seeing that on the website, but the V is just a model code. That's how like on some paperwork It'll say that EQS 450v. Then there's an EQS 450x. The X means there's the SUV version. The V is a sedan. Okay. So the, you know, you send me the link. I looked at it for his good. So the, the tie, the wheels are. Is a 21 inch wheels on the, on the one that we talked about. The, the white one we were looking at. Yeah, they are. Let's see here. I do think there's 31 and there are 21. Sorry, 20 inch. I think they're 20 inch. So the 21 inch is a little bit bigger wheels. Right? I'm sorry, the 21 is a little bit larger than the 20. Correct. Okay, so do they have a spare tire or is that a run flat tire? These are run flats. Run flat. Okay. And then the. I was going to ask you, does this have the. I don't know, anything just slipped out of my mind. Should I wrote it down? So. So who is figuring out the total? Who? I said, who's working on the. You know, the outdoor door price? Oh, gotcha. One of my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Yes, I will go check in with him, see if he has a number for me. Roughly. Do you want the monthly payment? You're looking in the range of like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's kind of what you're looking at monthly for the lease payment. Okay. For the total amount. I'm not sure. I have to go. I have to go see what the. You want like the residual or like the total amount of the car or. Well, this is gonna be lease, so right now. So the outdoor wouldn't matter much unless you were paying cash. Right. So actually the, you know, I have the. I. I used to have a [ORGANIZATION] and so then I can use the same charger. No, actually [ORGANIZATION] has a different type of charger. No, but I mean, don't you have a. Like a. Like an adapter that fits in there? Yeah, they sell adapters, but directly. These don't work with [ORGANIZATION] chargers. [ORGANIZATION] is the only company that does like their own different connection. Every other electric car will use the same connection that this one has. Our standard things like the J1772 connection. Or you could use a level three, which is the C. CCS Combined Charging System. Level one, level two, level three. No, but I have a friend of mine, he just bought a, you know, [ORGANIZATION] from you guys and he had a. He. He ordered a [ORGANIZATION] and then he canceled. But he got the [ORGANIZATION] charger, same as me. He said you can get the adapter and you can use. I said that there probably is adapters. Yes. Okay, so I don't have to replace it doesn't. It doesn't come with the car. We don't. We don't know the adapter, but there probably is adapters that you can purchase. Okay, so I have to go. Where do I go to get that? I'm sure on even probably [ORGANIZATION] might have something I can. I can look through the Internet, see if I can find something. Okay. Okay. So. So can you. Can I hold you Go talk to the guy and see what. What kind of dump. I mean, what kind of payment is going to be, hopefully. Yeah. Let me. Give me a sec. Let me see if he's at his desk, and I'll be right back. Okay? Okay. All right, thanks. We'd like to thank all of our customers for their continued loyalty and patronage. We appreciate your business. We appreciate your patience while you continue to hold. And we'll be right. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, thank you for holding. [PERSON_NAME] not at his desk right now. He. I'm not sure where he's at. I'm sure he's here within. At the dealership. Could you give me maybe [DURATION] [DURATION]? Yeah, can you call me back? Yeah, I'll call you back for my. For my. From this same phone number. Okay. Okay. And I. Okay, well, I did check the Internet. Right now there looks to be several adapters that you could purchase, so there definitely is adapters out there. Okay, so then I don't have to replace it, you know, to replace it. With the [ORGANIZATION], you could just purchase an adapter and probably just use that. Yeah, yeah. That's what my. You know, my cousin was saying. He said, no, you don't have to get the [ORGANIZATION] Charger because, you know, he has a [ORGANIZATION] Charger. He ordered it, and then for some reason, he changed it and he went to [ORGANIZATION] and he got the SUV from you guys. Yeah, and then the. When I leased the vehicle from you guys, the Gap. Gap get. Comes with the car, right? The. Which one? You know, the Gap, like extra insurance Gap. Oh, yeah, Gap insurance. Yes, that. That's on a lease. That's always included with the lease. Okay, all right, great. So I don't have to get extra insurance. Gap from my insurance company, right? Not Gap. No, you still need your personal, like, auto policy. Yeah, but I don't have to get Gap from them. Correct. Okay. It comes with the. So it automatically comes with the. With the lease. That's. That's correct. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, find out and then let me know because. Yeah, then I can come tomorrow. And then I have. I already talked to my insurance company, but I need to have the. The bin number and all that other stuff and then give you information. But you have the car already available, right? Yes, sir, it is available. Okay, now, is the. Is the windows tinted? Windows are not tinted. No, those are clear from factory. Okay, so you can get it tinted, right? Not at the dealership. No. I don't believe we do a. We don't have, like. We don't have, like, a tint shop in the back, per se. That. That we can do it here. But you can get it done, right? I don't think so. I don't believe we can get. We can send it out for tinting. I'll double check, but I don't. I don't believe we do tinting. Okay. Because I talked to. I'm not sure. Oh, are you asking me if you can get it tinted? Yeah. No. Oh, yeah. I mean, I called [LOCATION] dealership. We have a stock [ORGANIZATION] over here, and I was talking to them. You know, they have black and the window is not tinted. But they said they can send it out to get it tinted. So maybe you can find out. I see. I see. I'll check. I don't believe we work with any, like, a tank company, but I'll double check. Okay. Okay.

"Referral lead from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yes, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm calling to inquire about the [ORGANIZATION] Gladiator that you have for sale from your used side. [ORGANIZATION] Gladiator. That's [EMAIL_ADDRESS] popular item, my friend. Let's see here. Hopefully we still got it. Gladiator. Oh, yeah, we got [EMAIL_ADDRESS] couple of them. Which one exactly were you inquiring about? So here, one sec, let me. I got it up on [ORGANIZATION]. I have [EMAIL_ADDRESS] stock number, but it's probably the [ORGANIZATION], not the dealership stock number. Does that help? What's the number? It's [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Is it [EMAIL_ADDRESS] white one? Yeah. With like the, like brown interior? Yeah. With the tan leather? Yeah, yeah, we still got it, bro. Yeah. So I saw from the price history you had it previously at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Would you still be able to do that number? Good question, man. I'm not gonna say no, but I'm not gonna say yes. It is [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT], so I know in house we have [EMAIL_ADDRESS] lot of specials going on right now, so maybe we can make something happen, you know, I mean. Yeah, so I'm. I'm actually up in the [LOCATION] [LOCATION], so I wouldn't be able to come down immediately. I'm kind of just doing her [EMAIL_ADDRESS] big old search all over the place. Gotcha. So I've got [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. I've got [EMAIL_ADDRESS] similar one that I'm interested in that is able to offer free shipping for that price. And it's pretty much. It's pretty much identical. It's [EMAIL_ADDRESS] white one that's tan leather. It's just not in [LOCATION]. So I'm just trying to. They. They're really pushing [EMAIL_ADDRESS] warranty on me and I'm not really interested in [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [DURATION] [DURATION] warranty. So I'm just trying to shop around and see what my options are. Gotcha. For sure. Do you, do you have something that says [MONEY_AMOUNT] or. Say that one more time. Do you have something that shows the price at [MONEY_AMOUNT] on the website? Yeah, yeah, it's on [ORGANIZATION], so it has the price. Okay, can you screenshot that for me and then text it to me and then maybe we can get you to that price. Here, let me see. One second here. What, sorry, what number should I test you? Ready? Yeah. Okay. [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER]. Yeah, that's my personal cell. Here, let me. So that's. I. I just texted your personal cell. That's what it's showing it's just showing, it's, it's been with y' all for over [DURATION] [DURATION]. So you know, I'm just trying to find [EMAIL_ADDRESS] decent deal on [EMAIL_ADDRESS] gladiator. I know there [EMAIL_ADDRESS] lot of people are interested in them but you know, I'm, I'm trying to, I'm trying to keep it to less than [MONEY_AMOUNT] personally. I just bought [EMAIL_ADDRESS] house last year so I'm not trying to spend too, too much money on [EMAIL_ADDRESS] ride, but. Oh, gotcha. Yeah, hello? Yeah, can you hear me? Yeah, I hear you. I'm sorry, there was [EMAIL_ADDRESS] loud crackling sound. I wasn't sure if that was on my end of yours. Gotcha. Okay. Were you thinking about financing? Yeah, definitely debating between [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down finance and the rest. So depending on what the APR that I could potentially get, y' all do [EMAIL_ADDRESS] pretty wide reaching look for different banks to see what options are. Yeah, yeah, we work with over 60 banks. So we don't submit credit. We, I mean say for example, right. You know, I'll send you [EMAIL_ADDRESS] credit app and you do it. We look at the credit first before we submit it so we know which banks to go to. You know, I mean. Yeah, and then, you know, and then if, you know, if the banks we normally go to aren't taking it, then that's the one we brought in our search. You know, I mean, yeah, for sure. My credit over [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So I feel like, okay, yeah, you'll be alright man. Yeah, okay, for sure. So I mean, I can't, you know, I can't necessarily, you know, tell you that we're going to match the price right now. But you know, my [OCCUPATION] wants to see commitment, you know what I mean? So I mean if you want, you know, fill out [EMAIL_ADDRESS] credit app and then that way my [OCCUPATION] knows okay, this guy's serious, this guy means business. So you know, we can, we could definitely mess around with the price for you. Well, let's mean it was previously listed for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. If, if we could, if we could talk about that. You know, I don't want to fill out too many credit applications because I don't want to just take dings on my credit just to see what people's out the door prices are. You know what I mean? I mean? No, I mean I understand man, but I mean you, we're not gonna submit your credit and so you tell us to, you know what I mean? So just by filling out the credit app. Oh no, no, go ahead. So just by you filling out the credit App. It just shows commitment to my [OCCUPATION]. So then. So then, you know, we're gonna see your credit, and then obviously, if it's over [MONEY_AMOUNT], then, you know, my [OCCUPATION] is gonna ask me, okay, call him and tell him, you know, if we can run his credit. And then that's why I'll tell you, is it okay if we run it? And then, you know, that's when. That's when you get the inquiry on your credit report. Okay, so. Yeah, so you're able to see my credit score without submitting the official application until I'm ready to say yes. I actually do want to. Yeah, correct. Okay. Yeah, correct. Yeah, I can do that. The best way to do it is over email instead of phone. Just so I don't have to fill it out on my phone. Use the fingers. Rather just type it on my laptop. Can I give you my email to send it to instead of my phone number? Yeah, man. Give me one second. All right, hold on. Let me get [EMAIL_ADDRESS] pen. All right. What's your email? It's. It's [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] just with [EMAIL_ADDRESS] at the front. Yeah, it's [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. It's [EMAIL_ADDRESS] weird last name, man. [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm here, man. I'm just. I'm just writing down. Yeah, can you hear me? Yeah, sorry, man. For like, [DURATION] [DURATION], it was doing that weird. It was doing, like, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] real weird sound. I don't know, maybe scared on your head, but it was. It sounded like, you know, someone was throwing something down [EMAIL_ADDRESS] garbage disposal. All right. Yeah. Okay, cool. And so I'm going to email that credit app for you. And then just so you know, we don't need any references and we don't need any [OCCUPATION] information. Okay. All right, sounds good. And then at the bottom where it says [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], just. Just leave it blank. Okay, I can do that. Cool. For sure. All right, so I'm going to send this over to you. Right. Right. Right after we got this phone call, and then we'll go from there. Right. Cool, man. I mean, I'll go ahead now, fill in my Saturday. Just doing some car shopping, man, so. Yeah, I got you.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Hi, there. Hello. Hello. I heard a lot about your online, you know, because you guys are further. I mean, I live in area. Sir, can you hear me? I'm having a hard time hearing you. You're kind of cutting out. Can you. Can you hear me now? Yes, sir. Hello? Can you hear me? Coming through. Better? Yes, sir. Okay, cool. We're looking for a [ORGANIZATION] denali or at 4, preferably denali yukon. Not the [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE], just the shorty. I just really can't find them anywhere. I said in the beginning I bought a truck for you guys a while back, and you guys had good pricing and incentives. And I just wanted to see, is there a benefit to me ordering a Denali from you guys through you rather than somebody else? Is timing different? Is there any pricing? It's still going to be [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] on getting here if you order one. But we do offer invoice pricing, so you're probably going to be saving about [DURATION] [DURATION] $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And then as far as getting the vehicle, I mean, I'm in [LOCATION] or [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Do you guys ship or anything like that? So we do. We do offer a delivery, but there is a charge for that. Where exactly are you at? Where. What town are you located in? All right, we're in [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. This is like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay, give me one second. And would you have a trade or would you just be buying this? I do have a trade. I do have a trade. I'm driving right now to [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Cherokee with 30,000 miles on it. Okay. With the trade, that would only be one driver, and it looks like it's about 386 miles from here. So that would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for a delivery fee. So there's. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me now? Can you hear me? Yes, sir. Yeah, now I can. I'm sorry. Last thing I heard was to trade your 130, 386 miles. Yes. So since you have a trade, it would only be one driver. So it looks like you're about 386 miles from us. So that would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT], delivery fellow. Or I can fly up and just drive it down. Drive it down myself. Yeah, if you. If you. Yeah, probably have to drive it down, that would be. That would be a lot cheaper. Honestly. It would be a lot cheaper. How much is. Where do you guys. Where do people usually fly into? If you flew in, you could fly into [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. And we could meet you at the airport with the vehicle. We're about [DURATION] [DURATION] from the [LOCATION] and [LOCATION] border, so [LOCATION] is only [DURATION] [DURATION] away from us. So if you flew into [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] there in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], we could meet you at the airport with the vehicle. And. But since you have a trade, you probably have to drive it because I don't know if you'd be able to get that on the plane. Yeah, I'm still debating whether is there any incentive for me to do a trade rather than just sell it on my own. Sell it on my own [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] or something and then just get the cash. I mean, there. We don't really have any special, we don't offer any special discounts or anything for you trading it in. Right, Right. No, it's in good shape. I mean, my [MARITAL_STATUS] fairly driving 30,000 miles. Okay. So I mean it might be worth 20, I don't know. But. Okay, we do, I do want to, I do want to let you know we do have a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Yukon 84. We don't have a Yukon Denali. We just have a Yukon 84. It has about 23,000 miles on it. Wow. What do you guys. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What color? It's red with the black interior. And it does have them TVs in the back. It does. Okay. And then what? V8? Yes, sir, it's a V8, 6.2 liter, all wheel drive. Yes. No, it's four wheel drive. Okay. All right. And it's set for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Before TTNO, can you, can you take some photos for me with, for that or videos and send it to me just in case? Yes, sir. Can I get a good first and last name for you? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Last name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And a good phone number. Okay. And what is a good email address for you, sir? First name. Okay. All right. Yeah, I'll get you some pictures of that vehicle. And what I'll do too is I'll, I'll text you. Okay. So what if I say I don't like the vehicle or something or I want to go ahead and make it worth something so we could build it out. Like I said, I call, give you a call and you build it out and then yeah, we, you can call and give me, you can call, give me a call and we can build it out. And I'll send it over to one of my [OCCUPATION] and have him build it out on the website we have. And then with [ORGANIZATION], we can't give you a price until we actually, like, place the order. So that in order to actually place the order, we do require $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit just to mark the vehicle as yours. Okay, so I give you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit and it takes, let's say, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. And is that deposit refundable if the vehicle shows up? In the event something like happens? Yeah, if the vehicle shows up and you don't like it or anything, if it's not what we said it's going to be, we can refund it. Okay. All right, well, good deal. Shoot me. Or if you find another one before that one comes in, you find one that you want, you can just give me a call and I can refund that deposit to you. All right, good deal. Yeah, just shoot me the text with the photos of the 84. And then when you send me the text, I'll send you kind of like what I'm thinking of with the Denali. And then maybe we'll talk like Monday or something about. Are you there Monday? Yes, sir, I will be here Monday because I gotta get. I just haven't slacking and my [MARITAL_STATUS] needs a bigger vehicle and I just gotta get it. Oh, yeah, for sure. All right, man. I appreciate your name again. My name is [PERSON_NAME].

Okay, and then what would you like to know? Please tell me. So it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's without taxes, right? That's without tax, title, registration office. That's right.

I really don't have like a specific formula to give you like exactly what's the number going to be? I'm thinking out the door. [MONEY_AMOUNT].

I'll do my best. Or your business. Actually, can I change my offer? Yeah. How much is your new offer? I'm going down to. It's because. It's. Because the [DURATION] this is. It's [DATE_INTERVAL]. I had low miles, but it's still, like, out. It's kind of a little outdated because it's already [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL]. I'm thinking [DATE_INTERVAL].

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How can I direct your call? Hi, clear [ORGANIZATION], please. I'm sorry, what department? Can I get [ORGANIZATION], please? Oh, yeah, it's a step for a new car or pre owned? Pre owned. All right. One moment please and I'll get you over to the [OCCUPATION]. Thank you. Because you, the customer, are always our top proudy. [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON_NAME] speaking. How may I help you? Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I'm looking at a couple of [ORGANIZATION] pilots that I see online and I'm just checking to see if they're in stock and to get the price on them. Yes, sir. Are they new or pre owned? Pre owned. Pre owned. All right, now do you have stock numbers? I do, yep. I got stock numbers right here. So up. Yep. 43370. All right, that one is in stock. I am looking right at it. Okay, and what's the price on that one? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then the other one is [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Yes, sir. That is also in stock at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So for I get [MONEY_AMOUNT] less miles in the second one, but not the top trim package [DURATION] [DURATION] older. What about. Oh, that's priority accurate. Can you tell me something from a different dealership? If it's priority? Yeah, pull up my system. Just give me one. I'm gonna have to use a different system for that. Yeah. Okay. All right, I'm ready for that stock number. It is 14323 Alpha. All right. And that is. It looks like it's in stock. Can't guarantee it because I'm not physically there, but it looks like it's there and it is going for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And I think that's probably about it. So we're looking for 20. I'm going to say 20. 20 plus [ORGANIZATION] pilots. Okay. Any, anything above an EXL. Okay. Package and trying to be under 30,000 miles. But you know, I would say that's 32,000. Won't kill me. [MONEY_AMOUNT] is probably more than I want. Okay. You know, we've, we've been, I would say look at this this [DURATION] and just, you know, kind of figuring out what, what, what options there is. We've, we've gotten all of our cars from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], but they for whatever reason have no [ORGANIZATION] pilots right now. So. Okay. You know, they're pretty limited. So I'm going to go ahead. Let me ask you this. Has the ones that we just spoke about, have they been checking off your boxes. Yes, they are. I mean, yeah, so they. The [ORGANIZATION] Pilot, that first one, you know, the one that was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's a little bit more than I wanted to spend. Mainly because you know that I just don't know the difference between the Black Edition and the Touring Edition. Is there any way you can explain that and just tell me what they are? Yep, they are the same as in technology wise. It's just the Black Edition comes with black trim instead of the chrome trim. Okay. Yeah, I could care less about that. I hear you on that. Well, and I don't. I guess the title of this one doesn't tell me what I'm also really looking for. Although it's me that wants it more than my [MARITAL_STATUS]. And my [MARITAL_STATUS] was the one who did the cars for her. I would love it to be [TIME] passenger instead of 8. I would love the [OCCUPATION] seat. And so we found a couple that are good except don't have [OCCUPATION] seats. So again, that's not a deal breaker. Yeah, this Black Edition looks like. Yep, it does have the [OCCUPATION] seats. Okay. Yeah, the Touring one, it does as well. So. And then on. And I'm just talking pure rough numbers. How negotiable is that? That second one being the [MONEY_AMOUNT], you know, roughly [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Let me pull it up real quick for. Because we were here with. We were looking at one that was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. And I would just so much. And I mean, it's not. I'm not going to lie, it's not the Touring Edition. It was the special Edition. So it's probably a little bit lower, but it's same mileage roughly, and [DURATION] [DURATION] newer. But again, it's not the Touring addition. And that was for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And that's. That's kind of our leading candidate right now is. It's okay. It's got 10,000 miles on it, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The only problem with that is that it was not [MONEY_AMOUNT] an eight passenger, not a seven. So. Okay, well, let me ask you this. If I was able to do. I was able to get you about 40,000 on the black Edition, how would that make you feel? That would be pretty good. I'm sure. That's what 29,000 would you be able to get me if you can go down about. Because I just don't know which one she's gonna prefer. I'm gonna be straight up honest with you. Sure. And I could care less because it's not my car. My [MARITAL_STATUS] just refuses to deal with this herself. Would you be able to get me down about [MONEY_AMOUNT] on the other one? Again, roughly $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm not going to hold you to $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Sure. Let me see. I like you so much more than the other people I dealt with. Oh my God. You know, I mean, no, I'm like. So I called, I called [ORGANIZATION] and I'm like, you. And they're like, oh, just come on out. And it's like, guys, I leave in [LOCATION]. I'm not gonna drive [DURATION] [DURATION] to see what you guys have there. Like, you know, I don't want to. I don't want a car that bad. Like. I hear you. I hear you. So my, my system hasn't saved the cost of the, the other one, the 20, 23H. So I just gotta dig a little bit to get the true cost to see how much lower I can truly go. I was able to tell you the other one off the jump because it actually saved the cost in this one system. I just gotta use. Okay. Two other ways to pull it up. Do you mind if I just give you a call back and let you know exactly what I could do for you on that one? Yeah. Can you text me by chance? I'm not sure where I'm going to be. And I'll become sure. I'll be in a meeting. I'll give you my work cell at [TIME]. Okay. [PHONE_NUMBER]. And what was your name, sir? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And what's your name so I can write that down? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. That's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And then it's [PERSON_NAME].

[PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. All right. Awesome. I'm a feet. Yes, sir. If we, if we buy from you, can we still get oil changes at [LOCATION]? Absolutely. Okay. Absolutely. Yep. Yeah. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] was, was like, oh, they. You guys charge a lot more because you guys get free oil change. I don't care about that. Like, I, I don't know. I'd rather, I'd rather give you guys an extra [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] and get oil changes for life. It's just a nice perk. Absolutely. I don't know. Absolutely. I see the value in that as well. But yeah, let me figure out the exact cost that I can, that I have in this car and see if I can manage a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] discount on it. I have no idea. I have no idea if that's the one she wants. What I looked at is it's got 6,000 less miles on it. And I personally value that more than having black trim. But she might say, oh, I like the black trim, so. Okay. And I'll be able to call and see what she says. Yeah, no, that sounds good. If we come to a price that makes sense for the both of you all, and she says, hey, it's going to be one of the two. Could we be expecting you all to come to us this [DURATION]? Yes. Yep. I'm not sure about it today, just because it's a little bit later in the day, but definitely for sure. Yep. Okay, great. I just want to make sure we would have something. I would. I'd like. I'd like to set some up, you know, later today if. I'll talk with her, see what she thinks. Yeah, yeah. And once we figure out a day and time, I'll make sure both vehicles are here and ready for show, just because sometimes, like, other stores will call in on vehicles, and we'll let them, like, have it for the day just to show customers.

If I get disconnected, is this the best number to reach you on? Yeah. [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER]. Correct. Gotcha. Can you spell your last name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. First name? [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. No, no, no, no. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. All right. Omg. Sorry. Okay. Hold on one moment. Okay. Hello? Hello? [PERSON_NAME]? Hello? Yes. You there? Yeah, yeah. Okay. So great. I just pulled my inventory up and I do have a limited inventory for the two sides, so. That's awesome. Okay. Are you trading anything in? No, no, no. Traded. Awesome. Listen, it's [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] events. We have inventory and you can come in and sit down and see what incentives you qualify for. And it lattice side reductive cost to be able to minimize it or the model and the package. I only want the SLE SEL. That's the SEL. I know, I know. MSRP was around like nearly up and down [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So what's the best. What's my best prize you can get? Well, no, you have to come in and negotiate that. Okay. If you want to negotiate on the MSRP of the vehicle, you do have to sit down with myself [OCCUPATION]. But right now, like I said, two Stars are the most popular car we got. Okay. They're going to put together a deal with you as long as you're flexible. My team is super flexible. And they're not going to lose you over just a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. It's [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT]. Don't miss out on the sales events. And because you don't want to make it in to actually sit with the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. They want the time of your day and they're going to make it worth it. Listen to me. Eat. If you. If you give me your bottom, your best price, if you can, I can put a deposit right away. It's not a matter of a deposit. You have to come in right away. Okay. They're not going to take a deposit over the phone over this weekend because it's [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] and you're. Unless you're out of state, customer registering your vehicle out of state, you'd have to come in. I have no time. I have no time to go to the dealership until like next [DURATION]. Oh, well, the next. We'll have to call you next [DURATION]. If you're not coming to purchase a car and you're not ready till next [DURATION], those numbers are going to be different. Yeah, just ask your [OCCUPATION]. Well, I'm telling you now, unless you can make it in before the [DURATION] ends. Can you make it in before this [DURATION] ends? It depends on the price, you know, or depends upon it. No, I'm sorry, it's not that. It depends. The prices we're going to give you are only going to be valid until the end of this [DURATION]. So unless you can make it in at the end of this [DURATION], the numbers they're going to give to you are not going to be valid and they're not going to give you numbers if you're coming in the [DURATION] after. When can you make it in? I can be there. You can give me the right price. I can be there tomorrow. Okay. You know, if you can't do anything, that's it, that's fine. I can get you some numbers, but they're just not going to give you numbers if you're looking to buy a car next [DURATION]. The numbers right now are different, totally different. No, I know, I understand. If you can give me the prize one bought it by the end of the [DURATION]. That's okay. I can be there tomorrow. Yeah, I could definitely do that. Now, it does sound like this. Let me go ahead and pull that up for you and speak to my [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. But it sounds like you've also already gotten numbers. Is there numbers that you're looking for us to. To match or be. Because we can match or be any legitimate deal. What are the numbers that you're looking for us to be? I haven't contact any other dealership yet. Okay, well, not once I give them to you. And once I give you these prices, it's not going to be negotiable. This is why I'm telling you to come in and negotiate. Because that price is negotiable. You're better off doing it. Just give me the price. Just give me the price. It's required. I can do that tomorrow. Alrighty. Let me reach back out to them and I'll call you back. All righty. Have a good day.",failure,price_quote,unknown,medium,False,01105204872d41bfa41c22f18cf02ba8_transcript.json

It's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I'm just interested in how long the wait is for [ORGANIZATION] Hybrid 4xle. And you said Highlander or I know you said hybrid. Hybrid RAV4. I actually have a RAV4 Ltd. That's on the ground. Hybrid. Do you have an XLE? Just XLE, not on ground. They're like unicorns. I'll be honest with you man, just to be able to get them on ground. But I actually have one that's here. So you can at least get the feel for it, see it and just get the understanding of how the hybrid will work. Okay, now I know the call. I'm interested in how long the white is for an xl. Oh, I have a white one, but it's a limited. No, but I went to Excel. What are you looking for within the vehicle, sir? No, I know exactly the car one. So I'm just asking how long is the wait? [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, so here's my question for you. I have one. It's brand new. Okay. If I was going to sell it to you, would you buy it? Yeah, definitely. My [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] will fall in love with that. Just the fact that you even have that as an offer.

When it comes, when it comes to the title purposes, do you have the title on you? No, I don't have the car. I mean I'm literally picking up the call Tuesday. Question is, is that vehicle being financed or that vehicle is already paid off. I'm going to pay with cash. Pay it with cash. So you will be having a title bill soon. Because it would just need a title in hand before we even work to make that offer to sell. But like, here's the thing, like, I think a [OCCUPATION] should be able to tell me. I will send you. I mean, I can tell you how much exactly I paid for the call. And I'm interested in will you pay more than what I paid for it? I paid [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] out the door.

Thank you for calling me [ORGANIZATION]. And [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. I might help you. Oh, hey, how are you? I was just curious to see if you guys had a certain vehicle in stock that I was interested in leasing. Yeah, it is the Taos S. I think we might have it. I know we have somebody coming in later today to look at it. Were you looking to come in pretty soon and check it out? Yeah. So long story short, it's for my [MARITAL_STATUS] but she has a [ORGANIZATION] now, Jetta. The lease is almost up and she went to the local lease right by us. They had a towel test but then they called her and said someone just took it. So long story short, she was gonna give her card like do like an early trade in thing. I think she has [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] on it and then do a [DURATION] [DURATION] lease for the new house and she, they gave her like the figures, numbers and everything and then it just fell through because the guy said somebody ended up taking it before our appointment. So I figured, okay, let me try another [OCCUPATION]. We live in [LOCATION] so it looks like you guys are the closest ones. Okay, let me put you on hold for [DURATION] [DURATION] and I'll go make sure that car is available because I don't want you to drive all the way out here and then I'll be available. So I'll let you know in about [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, cool, thank you. Thanks man. Place to buy and service your [ORGANIZATION].

Yes. Okay, so that car is still available for now, but we do have an appointment on it later today. You know, do you know what time you'd want to stop by? Within the next [DURATION]? [DURATION] [DURATION] to [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, awesome. You mind if I grab your first and last name before we hang on that I can put you in the system? Yeah, let me give you her info. She's the one who's buying it. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and last name [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. If you look in your system you probably could find her her current leased car. I don't know if you guys have access to that, but the Jetta or whatever that she has right now. Okay, and what's a good phone number for you? [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay, so you said you'd be. You being within the [DURATION]. Yeah. So just a couple little questions I'm just going to ask me. Do you know what color the car is? I think it's. Yeah, I'm. I'm pretty sure it's white. Just then there's only one and it's a white one. Yep. Yes sir. Okay, and then is it available for a [DURATION] [DURATION] lease the way the other place was telling her it is? Yes sir. And then what's this thing? As I was talking to you, as I was talking, I was looking, browsing through the website. Yeah, I don't know if you still have this car there, but there's a [DATE_INTERVAL] cows S. It looks like it's had some mileage on it. This is 24,295. It's a black Taos S. I don't know if you see that too or I have a stock number or model code if that helps you at all. Yeah, what's the stock number on that AK6204A. Okay, awesome. Yeah, I will. I'll check on that for you and then I'll send you a quick text in the system. That way you have my number if you need to. Let me know if you need to. If you need to change the. Change the appointment or anything like that or if you need to come in at a later time. Yeah, so I'll tell her about the white one and then just text me as soon as you can if you have this black one I'm seeing online. It's under like your website or whatever. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL], so. But since the black one is a [DATE_INTERVAL] and it is pre owned, that one is not going to be available for lease. It won't be available for finance or a cash deal. Yeah, so that's, that's fine too. I'm just. I was curious if you. If you had it in at all, so. Okay. Well, yeah, I will as soon as I find out. I'll let you know. I'll give you a quick text or a little call right before you guys come in. And then other than that, I think. I think we're all good to go. All right, thank you. Sounds good, man. I'll see you soon.

"Cranky. I say it, [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, I was wanting to check on some availability on a couple of vehicles that you guys have online. Yeah, for sure. Give me just one second and I'll connect you to one of our [OCCUPATION]. Thank you. Sure. All jobs big and small are fixed right the first time. Someone will be with you shortly. Thank you for holding. Did you know that every vehicle we sell is backed with a crane commitment? Thank you for calling. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. I was calling to see if you guys had two vehicles that I've been looking at online still available. Yeah, sure. Which vehicles are those? They are both a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Soul LX. But they're both Mars orange. So I see. So I see that I have one. Let me check and see if I have the second one as well. Are you local here in town? No, I'm from [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. Okay. All right. Well, since you're out there, is there a good time for you to come in? If I do have both of those, are you wanting to get both of them? No, just one of them. Okay. Well, I do see that I have the one I wanted. Yeah, well, I know that I do have the one. Okay. Do you have any miles is on it? I believe they're brand new, so they wouldn't have many miles on them at all. Yeah, they're usually what happens is whenever they get in and there's a pre delivery inspection on them, they have to drive them around. I think it's like five or six miles. So there's maybe like 15 miles on them. Oh, okay. That's nothing. I also have another question. I know on the website one of them is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. They both are. Is that the actual price I pay for or is there other markups you guys add to it? So that will be the MSRP of the vehicle. I've seen us get close to that. But usually we do have a markup on there just because of our inventory being super low. But the one thing is that we can work on getting. There's other things that we can put into the deal. Trade incentives as well as dealership incentives. Since we are moving over to a new building, we kind of got to move all this inventory out so I can see what kind of deal I can do for you. But what we have listed online is that MSRP price. But there is the market adjustment on that. Okay. Because I don't have a trade in. Okay. All right. Do we have any money down? I'm paying for it all in cash. Okay. Okay. Well, the one thing is that with what I could do is the better deal that I can do for you would be through financing. Just because we kind of get kickback from the bank with financing and everything. And so what we would do is if you would be interested, just finance it. Finance it for [DURATION] [DURATION]. That's all that we ask for payment wise on that. And then after that [DURATION] [DURATION], then you can just pay the rest of it off. And then at that point, I mean, you would only accumulate maybe $[MONEY_AMOUNT] of interest on that, but it'd be able to help save you a good amount of money. Okay, what do you can reserve one? What I could do is, if we are interested, I can send over an invoice for a deposit, basically. So what you would do is you would, I believe it is like $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. You put a deposit in and then we would work out all the details and everything, get you here, have you drive it, make sure that you like it, fill out all the paperwork and everything, and then we would go from there. Okay, so say I don't want the car. Do I get the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] back or is it something you guys keep? I believe you should be able to get the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] back. I mean, with it being a sole and everything. Usually like with the higher trim, like the Telluride and the carnival and those kinds of things. Sometimes we'll keep the deposit, depending on how long we're holding it. But with it being a sole and if you can get here within the next [DURATION] [DURATION], then we would definitely be able to give that back to you. Okay, so it would probably be this coming weekend by the time I met. Okay. All right, well, here, let me just get all of your information and stuff and then I'll keep up with you and we will work on, make sure everything's together for you and set that time for you to come down. Sound good? So on the fee that you guys would put on it for like the. What did you say? The market adjustment? Yeah, the market adjustment. Do you know how much that would be? Like just a rough estimate. Right. Well, what I'll do is, what I'm going to do is I'm going to get all of your information, everything, and then I'll go to my [OCCUPATION], talk with them, let them know that you live in [LOCATION] and that you know that you want to get it this weekend and so kind of set everything up for you. That way I can give you like numbers and everything and so we can figure out what your Thoughts are on it and all that kind of stuff. I mean, we can wait until Saturday and then see where we can get to I on that, but I don't want you to, like, put the deposit down and. And get here on Saturday and then drive all the way down here and not get it and things like that. Okay, that'll work. All right, awesome. Well, then can I get a first and last name from you? [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. All right, awesome. And then what is your address? [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. All right, and then is this a good phone number to contact you back on? Yeah. Okay, what is that phone number? All right, and then what's a good email address for you also? And then is all that lowercase? Yes. Okay. Okay. And then you said you don't have a trade, Right? Okay. Hailstorm. Got it, got it. We've had a lot of that here recently. And so you're wanting the Mars orange sold? Yes. Okay. All right, and then let's see. Is there kind of like a monthly payment you're looking to be at on that? Preferably not. Okay, but if we have to do one to get a lower payment and we can only do it, say for [DURATION] [DURATION], that's fine. But like, I don't know, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, right. Which, I mean, with that, I mean, what we could do is you could put down the least amount that we asked to have finance, I believe, is like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So what you could do is you can just put down whatever amount that we agree to to get it to that [MONEY_AMOUNT], and we just finance the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And so then at that point, you're paying less interest overall because it's going to be on a lower amount. And then in the [DURATION] [DURATION], you can just pay the rest of it off. And then we would be good there. So that would be something that we can do. Just want to make a note, preferably no payments, if possible. Right. And like I said, what it would be is that you would. We set up kind of a. The best price for you would be through financing. And then what you would do is just after that [DURATION] [DURATION], I mean, you can just pay the normal payments or you can split the amount that we finance in [DURATION] [DURATION] just for that fourth payment. All you would do is just pay the rest of it off. Okay. Okay. All right. So we're open to financing to get you a better deal overall. It depends on what this deal is. If possible, can you get me a deal for financing and for all paid in cash. And kind of that way I have two numbers to go by. Yeah. Yeah, you can definitely do that. I'll get that for you. All right. And then. Okay. All right, so what I will do is I will get all that stuff together for you. I'll get with my [OCCUPATION] and see what they're thinking, and then we'll go from there. All right, awesome. Well, I will talk with you soon, then. All right. Thank you. Thank you. You have a great rest of your day. You, too. Thanks. Bye.

"Hello, this is [PERSON_NAME] with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm calling to check regarding the inventory. So I visited [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in earlier this week. I was looking for an [ORGANIZATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] Blue Nirvana. Yeah, so I was told that it's not in the inventory. I'm looking for a premium plus by the way, [DATE_INTERVAL] brand new. I was told it's not in the inventory and I was asked to check back with you guys by [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] this week. So I'm calling regarding that for that [ORGANIZATION] Blue Premium Plus [DATE_INTERVAL]. It looks like right now we only have the prestige and the premium. We do have a premium plus incoming black interior and this one is the premium plus 20 inch wheels. And it should arrive realistically around [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] to [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] time. [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] to [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yes sir. Okay, so the only premium plus you have is in [DATE_INTERVAL] is apparel. [PERSON_NAME] right now is right. Let's see. Premium plus Q5s have gray black interior. I have white, gray interior, gray black interior. Yes sir. And then I have. Yeah, those are going to be mostly it. So don't have a blue. No, just prestige and premium. For that blue though I have a. It says I have a [ORGANIZATION] blue gray interior. This is a premium. But it does have the convenience package and the panoramic sunroof. The only thing that would be missing is a full digital display and the sound system. But besides that it's the exact same car. I mean do you have the lane protection and all? Yes sir. In the convenience package it gives you those features. The adaptive cruise control, the active lane assist, the hands free tailgate, the wireless key to lock and unlock it. So it's basically the exact same thing. I don't see because you guys provided me the checklist last time when I visited in the convenience packet. I don't see the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] all here on my end. Give me just a second and I'll be able to find out exactly for you. So you do get the blind spot warning, the lane departure warning. It would alert you and vibrate the steering wheel if you're wandering off. It does have the presence the frontal collision avoidance and avoidance assistance, but. Correct. The only thing it would be missing is the adaptive cruise control and the active lane assist. It does have the lane assist, it's just not active and it does have cruise control. That one is if not the adaptive as well. What does this mean by active Lane assisted? Does have lane assist. Sorry sir, can you repeat that one more time? It's a little loud in here? No. What is the difference between a lane assist and an active lane assist? In the lane assist, it would alert you. It would beep and vibrate the steering wheel that you're wandering off the lane. It would kind of tighten it up where the active. It would pull you back into the middle of the lane if you start to wander off. It automatically does that. Exactly. Yes, sir. As long as it's turned on. Yes, sir. And what else is different? What is the other one which is different? The cruise control. What does it do? What's the difference? So you do have cruise control. If you're in cruise control, it will stop you before you hit the vehicle in front of you. And the adaptive cruise control, it will work for very low speed limits as well. It will slow you down and bring you back up to the same speed limit that you were just going in. Even during these slow, low speed. I mean, low speed limits. Exactly. The lower speed limits. But the premium one has the cruise control as well, so we'll speed you back up as well. What's the price difference between these [MONEY_AMOUNT]? So the premium plus one coming in down the road is priced at. Looks like there's no price on it right now. I'm guessing it's probably going to be somewhere like in the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh, somewhere around there. And then the premium one with the convenience is at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes, sir. So about a [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] price difference. And it's [DATE_INTERVAL], brand new, right? [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yes, sir. [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Blue Metallic gray interior, which looks really pretty. Can you send me what it has? Like, can you send me the sticker? Sticker? Yeah. Can I email it to you? Is that okay? Yeah, yeah, fine. Okay. Give me just a second. Let me grab that email. What's a good email for you? You don't have my email. I think you should have my details. Right? I gave my details. I'm not allowed to have access to your information since I wasn't working with you. But I can still send it to you if you're okay with sharing that email with me. Can you text me from any number? I can send you my email or text. Okay, so here, give me just a second. Okay, Give me just a moment. Okay, sir. And what's that phone number? Okay, so I have your phone number here now. And I am getting that sticker put together so I can share that with you as soon as possible. I'm getting a hold of that now give me just a moment. Okay. Okay. Okay. I just sent it over to you via PDF file and then I just took a screenshot in case you can't see it as well. Okay, you should have received that right now. Let me check. I'm comparing both options. Perfect. Yes, sir. Just let me know what you think. I really want to help earn your business here and make it as easy as possible. Can you scroll down? Can you repeat that? Can you hold online for a minute? [PERSON_NAME] has it in her drawer for sure. Yeah, I can hold on the line. Yes, sir. See, the only difference is the sound system and the full digital dash. And then the canonomic sundle 1450 in excess. Okay. Convenience package is [MONEY_AMOUNT], right? [MONEY_AMOUNT], yep. Correct. In addition, you have something like 19 will take, right? Can you. Can you repeat that 19 wheel package you have like for additional 800? Oh, does it say it on there? Yep, it looks like it does have those nicer wheels. Oh, actually I don't see the 19 inch wheel package on that one, but that is something you could get. White S5. Yeah. Are you sure it's not the Chronos gray one? I only have the gray 1. Bison S5, right? Yeah, I sold that one. It's pre sold. Chronos gray. Is it a new or used? New. New. I shouldn't have no white S5 keys. Let's take a look. Glacier white, black interior, S5. That one. What's the stock number? A17575. There was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I was looking for a Y1, but they don't pre owned. No, no, no. New. Yeah. What's the stock number? Let me go check. All right, sounds good. I sold the great new one. Hello? Hello? Yeah. What's the difference between the RDQ5, 40 and 45? What's the 40, TSX and 45? The 45 has 30 more horsepower and torque than the 40. The 40 would be like 232. And then the 45 would be like 263 or 262. So 30 more horsepower and torque. The grill is a little bit nicer. And then you get the S line badge on the sides. Okay, so you're saying the 45 is much better. Yeah. More power. It's same engine. Nothing changes on the engine. Same engine. But you do get the different grill, which is nicer. And S line badge on the side of the car, which looks pretty sweet. What does that mean? I mean. Oh, just saying it has more power in it. It has the 45s line engine. Okay. It's more power in it, the engine is more powerful. That's it, right? Yes, sir. Exactly. So that's the reason why the base price is different. Exactly. Yes, sir. Okay. But I don't see the lane change and all here. The. The lane assist. It should be in safety convenience. And then you'll see it on the bottom third up, it says lane departure warning. Ldw. Yeah. Okay. It has blind spot. So it has blind spot. Monitors. Monitors with the lights as well. Yes, sir. Correct. Okay. It's [MONEY_AMOUNT] on road, right? No, no, that's before tax titling, licensing. That's before tax, title and licensing. Okay, [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus tax. Right. Title and license fee, sir. Okay. And how much it would be like in total on total [MONEY_AMOUNT] taxes. And then title and license is about like [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So let's just say somewhere on, like I can find out for us. Can you find. Can you do it? Yep. Is this something you could see yourself buying? Is it available immediately? What is it? I mean, is it available immediately? Can I get it immediate? Of course. I can have it ready for you this afternoon. So that one here. I'm putting the numbers together. Oh, what the heck. It's not on my website for me to see the TTL out the door is probably going to be somewhere around. Okay. Out the door, your price would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. After everything, after taxes and all. Yes, sir. Correct. What would it be for the premium one? Just depends which one you go with. Honestly, man. But let's say you go with one that's at [MONEY_AMOUNT] sticker. You would be at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, I have the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. How much it would cost [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Sicker. It would be [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] after tax, title, licensing, premium plus. Yes, sir. It's only [MONEY_AMOUNT], you're saying, right? What is it? I mean, it covers everything except [MONEY_AMOUNT], but it says like MSRP. Oh, the difference is. Yeah. 360 camera view. Built in. Panoramic sunroof, upgraded sound system, the active lane assist. And the wheels are different. Wheels are different. What's the top view camera system? Huh? The 360 camera. 360 camera. This one doesn't have a 360 camera, correct? Yes, sir. Okay. Yeah. So, sir, I have to take care of some guests I have here in the office. The number I texted you from is my best number. I would love to earn your business. Saturdays are my busiest [DURATION] and it is the [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] the month. There is a chance that basically none of these vehicles will be available. So just let me know what you think and how I can help and I will answer your questions as soon as possible. Sure. I will go with either of these [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Like you said, you have only Daytona gray. Pell, right? Yes, sir. Correct. For the premium plus, for convenience, you have the Nirvana blue. Yeah, for. So let's take a look. Let me take a look real quick. Yeah, that's what you sent me. Okay. Yes, sir. Then that should be true. Blue metallic and gray interior. [ORGANIZATION] blue. [ORGANIZATION] blue metallic. [PERSON_NAME]. Gray interior. Correct. And then premium plus we have the Daytona gray, black interior, white with gray interior and gray with black interior again. Okay, and what time are you open today? Till [TIME] okay. And tomorrow and day after tomorrow, you're off? We are closed tomorrow, but we will be back and open on Monday. So you have.

It's supposed to be the door lock. The driver's side door is an unlocking. Driver's front seat will not adjust. So it looks like they have completed the door unlocking issue. But as for this front seat, we're waiting on a seat frame and I guess we were sent originally. I'm sorry.

Okay, and then just in case we do get disconnected, I want to make sure we have the best number to get a hold. That's correct. Okay, perfect. And you were looking for a Prius Prime? No, I mean that doesn't matter. I mean I can do regular R Prime, so I just wanted to one the limited sim. Okay, and then were you looking for a new vehicle or pre owned the new one? Okay, let me see here. Okay, and give me one quick second. I'm going to put you on a quick hold while I do an inventory search for us, okay? Okay. Your budget. Let us show you how easy it can be. Come by our [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION] dealership today. Don't let that warning light on your dash ruin your day.

So when something goes wrong or you're ready to perform preventative maintenance, call the people who know how to make it right. Let us know how we can help you when we return to your call. Alrighty. So it looks like yes, I do have one of the one Prius Limited available. It is in [DATE_INTERVAL] in the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. When would be a good time to come by to reserve the vehicle? Do you guys have any markup by any chance? And what should be the round? Can you. Hello? Hello? Hi. Yeah, I can hear you now. Hi. Oh, okay. Well, last Prius that I sold, it was a Limited. I sold for about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh wow. So the markup is around like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I think more than that. Well, it does vary. I mean we do offer market pricing and I mean if you look, you know, in the area, [DATE_INTERVAL] Priuses are going for about, I mean [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the limited and that's for a new vehicle. So wouldn't you rather pay a little bit more for a new one for the [DATE_INTERVAL] or three? Well, a [DATE_INTERVAL] is selling for close to MSRP for a [DATE_INTERVAL]. So wouldn't you rather pay a little bit more for a [DATE_INTERVAL]? Oh yeah, I think I'm looking for [DATE_INTERVAL]. Correct. Yes. Yeah. So like, like markup is around like how much? Because I think I'm living not very nearby. I think I'm like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] away. Markup is too much. I think I might profit. But if we can negotiate about the markup, I would really like to go forward with it. Okay, well let me ask you this. You sound like you've been shopping for a little while. What have the other dealerships been offering you? To be very frank, I have one available in [ORGANIZATION]. They are like, they have a marker bar on 5K and that's the same like it is ready to be ready to get other. I am looking for the like [LOCATION], they don't have any markup but they don't have a vehicle queue. So it is like coming up. I am on the wait list. But yeah, they don't have a markup, they don't have a vehicle. So other than that I think there is nothing. Who have like a little vehicle right now still on the waitlist. Yeah. So there is just one more reason. Have you had the opportunity to at least test drive the vehicle? No, I did not, to be very frank. No. Well, I do have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Prius Alley here in my inventory. It's not unlimited, but I have an owie. Uh huh huh. And would you be interested in coming down to maybe test drive it. That way you can get at least a feel for the size and as well as how small. I have seen it. I mean I have feel it. It's just like I did not have drive it because the nearer one they have like something for the like feeling but they were not allowed for the driving purpose. I would recommend you to at least drive one because what if you don't even like the way it drives? I could invite you down to. Come down. I'm gonna open time slot at [TIME]. No, I agree, but I think I would definitely like to buy it. Well, you. Yeah, I mean come. We have one that you could drive here. It's an le. No, I agree, but the only thing is we need to drive like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. So that's the. That's the only point. And I'll be done with my job by like next [DURATION] [DURATION] second. Definitely come by if you. If you are like tell me something like some codes. I mean, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I am. I'm ready to buy. To be very frank. It's just like the market is too high for me. Okay. Okay. So if you can something. Something in between. I think we can definitely negotiate like face to face, but at least some range you can give me. I have some idea in my brain. So that's the only thing. Mm, let me see here. I mean what I would recommend you to do is I would recommend you to come down test drive the vehicle. If you like the way the vehicle drives, then I'd be more than happy to show you the different pricing programs that we could offer you. No, I really appreciate it, but we are actually looking for like literally for the buying purpose for the limited. We have like actually somewhere we have a like list ready for like some wait list. We have like just put our name. I know I have not drived it, but I think I would. I can. I can go. Go for it for sure. Okay, but. Yeah, but just before, like before just driving for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], I need something in my mind just like what can be the price? I mean, I don't want you to like send me the exact price, exact quote, but. And it's something so I. I can actually drive for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. I hope you can understand. Like I said, I mean the last one I sold was selling for about [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Ah, wow. Okay. I mean you have to. These vehicles too. These vehicles as well, they don't regularly don't make it on the lot. I mean, like I said, I recommend you to come down to test drive the one we have here in stock. Believe it or not, about 98% of the Prius primes are precision. Yeah, I know, I know. I mean, I'm hearing everywhere, so I. You know, all of the hybrid vehicles. No, I agree. I agree. Yeah, but I think for the [MONEY_AMOUNT], it's, like, big market for me. Well, I mean, what I could tell you is your presence is your leverage. I would come on in, test out the one we have here, and then we could talk about the different pricing programs that we could offer you. Yeah, it's fairly simple to do a reservation. You pick the best program that works for you. After that, I just take a small deposit, and I update you every Friday after that until the vehicle arrives. Once the vehicle arrives and you just pick it up. No, that sounds good. Yeah, let me check with my [MARITAL_STATUS] and I'll call you back. Okay, sounds good. All right. Yeah. Thank you. You have a good day. Bye. Bye.",failure,inventory_check,Prius Limited,medium,False,0160bfdb402e4018a99d31d170e87250_transcript.json

Plus much more we want to make sure. Hello. Hello. How are you today? Good, but I can hear you really well. I'm sorry. Hello. How you doing? [PERSON_NAME] of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], how may I help you? Oh, they switched me again for somebody else. It's already third time. I'm the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], so I'm the one that gets the answers of what you're looking for to do a lease buyout. Okay, I got you the first question. It was, I have a car from you guys and I would like to buy out. Okay? And the first question is, I understand the guarantee on that card is supposed to be on 36,000 miles for [DURATION] [DURATION] and I get past 22,000, should I buy now guarantee or should I wait? Because it's going to be for me really a little hard to buy and pay the guarantee, you know. And the second question, and the first one, I want to just be sure. I want to check their car, that car. What the, you know, diagnostic. If it's everything okay there before you're gonna buy it, it's going to be called by my insurance or it's going to be additional fee. So you want to know what the buyout is, who you. Who are you leasing the car with? I am listing for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. And they send me later and I know how much it's gonna cost me now. Yes, and the question is I would like to check my car and question is about my. The guarantee, if I can now, you could bring it on into our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to come take a look at it, that's for sure. Now, are you paying for your lease out in cash or are you looking to finance the remainder? I can pay in cash. Okay. Now if you're paying for in cash, you have to do that directly with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. There's a couple things that you have to do in the meantime. Usually we do this, set up the financing for you and you can pay it off with the next monthly payment and pay off the entire car, but at least we get to do the registration, titling the car for you and everything. Like that. I'm so sorry. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I try to explain the two people before you. My [LANGUAGE] is not that well, speak very slow and try to explain slowly. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Okay, just be patient. If I want to buy cash, the half of them at least. You know something how it works. Are you going to pay the entire thing in cash or you paying some in cash? Possible to do full time, full price. You have to do it. We'll do it with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] now, if you're looking to finance some of it. And there. No, no, I don't want to finance. No, I don't want to. So you have to do. You have to deal directly with how automotive and then they'll set you up with the process of how sending them the check for the remainder. Okay, I got you. Yes. And another question. What about my guarantee when I start to buy the new ones? You can do that as soon as possible, obviously, because you know the earlier you do it, the less expensive it will be for you. So you can do that as well. And how much is going to be if I'm going to buy today, tomorrow, until I'm going to pay out the car? It all depends on how much are you looking to add as an insurance on coverages on your car? I mean, obviously the more time and the more miles, the more expensive it is. So it starts anywhere from [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Because right now I have from the bumper to bumper. I understand. Yes, yes, something like that. How much is going to cost me exactly? It all depends on how long you're extending that bumper to bumper coverage and how many times, how many [DURATION], how many mileage and stuff like that. But you're really giving you from [DURATION] [DURATION]. And obviously we can go [DURATION] [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION]. All depends. The extension go could start from [DURATION] [DURATION] and up. [DURATION] [DURATION] and up. Okay. And that kind of. Where should I pay that money to you pay to us. To us. Yes. Correct. Okay. And I need to go there just to talk about that. Or you can tell me by the phone how much is going to be if it's for [DURATION] [DURATION] from the bank, I need the VIN number, I need the mileage, I need registration. Okay, so how long. How long do you want to do the insurance for? Give me for [DURATION] [DURATION] for now. [DURATION] [DURATION] from now can cost you about $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Wow. So expensive. Mm. Because you're extending used car coverage on the car right now. Yeah, but my car is just only 22,000. Well, it's the time, it's not mostly the miles. Okay. And it's going to be from the bumper to bumper, bumper to bumper and engine and transmission as well. $[MONEY_AMOUNT] is not going to be less. I was expected for [DURATION] [DURATION]. [DURATION] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [DURATION] [DURATION]. I was expecting from. For [DURATION] [DURATION]. If I'm going to buy for [DURATION] [DURATION] and it's going to cost me just only [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] to interest on it. Okay, that's what I expected. Oh, is that a quote that you got or that's what you're expecting for it? Okay, that's another question. Yes, that's a good question. Yeah, yeah. The departure labor because you got to also remember they're covering a lot of parts in the vehicle. The vehicle will have over over 5,000 worth of electrical components that runs the engine, transmission and all the electrical parts in the car. Yeah, but I understand, but you understand one point because my car, I don't know if the next [DURATION] [DURATION] is going to be $36,000. [MONEY_AMOUNT], 36,000 miles. You know, I'm not driving too much. I'm driving just to school and pick up the kids and. And I don't think so. I have a guarantee for [DURATION] [DURATION]. 36,000 miles and. Right. Yes. Now. Yes. But anyway, if [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I understand really well. But if [DURATION] [DURATION] I'm not going to even use that 36,000 miles and it just additionally called me another $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for. I just don't understand that. You know, what is your location? Guys want to [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? It's in [LOCATION]. No, it is in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] on [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. It's on. It's [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]. I'm sorry, [LOCATION]. Correct. Okay.

And I don't understand that. Before we. Excuse me. Before we bought the car, there was no problem at all getting anybody on the phone. My tag is running out now, and all I'm asking is to speak to someone. So I need you to get me someone on the phone, please. I know with that big dealership, somebody got to be available. One moment. Let me see if I can find a [OCCUPATION] over. The [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Normally, I would just send you over to our [OCCUPATION], but he's currently training some people, so I could send you to his voicemail and he'll get back to you.

I have been trying to call at this dealership for just about ever since I got in the car. Now, we have exactly [DURATION] [DURATION] before the tag run out. We hadn't heard from anyone. I've been trying to get some information so that if we get stopped for any reason, I would have some information saying that the car belongs to us, which I do not have, because when they dropped the car Off. I did not have any information whatsoever. And now the tag about to run out. Don't have a. I don't have a title. Don't have anything. And we're trying to get some information about the car so we can get some things taken care of. Sure, absolutely. I apologize. So let me see. Let me look up some stuff real quick. It looks like you bought this back on [LOCATION]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Correct. Is the deal. That is correct. That's my [MARITAL_STATUS]. Okay. It looks like. So you never received anything like documents like for the purchase of the vehicle? I don't have anything. Okay. The paperwork that I did get. Yes, sir. Okay. And then let me. Let me get with them. Let me get with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. I'm gonna see if I can send out a new tent tag in that paperwork. That looks like. I'm not sure. I don't know if they relay this or not. It looks like the original property tax receipt. I need property tax receipt needed to send over documentation for that. You paid your property tax for [LOCATION] [LOCATION] for $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. What? Property tax. They haven't even come out yet. I guess it's some kind of property tax for [LOCATION] [LOCATION] that they're asking for. I'm just reading some notes. That's in the. When that was. That was in every defeat you said. I don't understand. [LOCATION] went in when we paid for the car. No, I think this is a. So I guess like in. In [LOCATION] [LOCATION], there's. There's original paid property. There's property tax you guys have to pay on, I guess a house, a condo, something. I'm not sure. I think [LOCATION] [LOCATION] is different because there's. That the taxes you guys pay is [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] the car. Right. But then there's the taxes. Like. But the way they get their taxes is like, I guess on a house or a condo or some kind of property taxes is how they really get their taxes. That comes out. That comes out [DURATION] [DURATION] after we have the car. Right. I guess there's money owed past, like in the past [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Absolutely not. We have five cars and we don't owe any taxes on anything. Not on the cars itself. But I guess they're. When they're. They're trying to register the vehicle from [ORGANIZATION]. It's a company that we use is called [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Huh. And they're. They're saying that they're not able to register the vehicle because the. The state of [LOCATION] [LOCATION] stating that there is a. Some kind of a Mountain Dew. I mean, you're welcome to check with the [ORGANIZATION] or whatever they're called there. I don't. I don't know what it's called there still. I'm just gonna buy with the notes. They're telling us that I. That I don't know. I mean, right now, I apologize because I was under the pressure and they reached out to you. So I. I want to go over this with you right now because I want to get it handled. It's something. So they won't register the vehicle without this [MONEY_AMOUNT]. $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] is what they're telling me. And who is. Who is telling you that? Because I can't go fix nothing. I don't know where to go. Right. So this is on a. This is a form that we get. That I get from them from what's called [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] through. It's a company that we use to titles the vehicle. They go to the [ORGANIZATION] office in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] and register the vehicle for you. So when they go in to register the car, they're. The [ORGANIZATION] office in the state of [LOCATION] [LOCATION] is telling them that they cannot register this vehicle under your name because of that. And they saying we owe money. Yeah, there's some kind of property tax or something that needs to be paid before we can register the vehicle. But I'm gonna. Like. What I'm gonna do today is I'm gonna send out copies of the purchase order and everything and a new temporary tag to you. That way you don't. So you don't get pulled over or anything like that. And then if you want to reach out to the [ORGANIZATION] office yourself and ask them what's most certainly find that out. And if there's something that's owed or whatever you guys want to do on that, just let me know. And then for some reason there is something owed or if there's nothing owed or however you guys want to do it, if you could send me an email stating that it was paid with the receipt, or if there's something saying that there's nothing owed and them saying that there's nothing owed and send me an email on that, I can get everything titled for you. Most certainly. And because, I mean, like, no one told. The only thing she told me she needed was insurance on the car. I sent her that. And I think whenever. Anything. Yeah, and I apologize for that because I'm not. I'm not sure why she didn't say this after. I'm just looking at the Notes from. There's a. We have a [ORGANIZATION] Doc from it, and that's the next set of notes that I'm looking at. And typically I don't handle this stuff. And she's not in right now, so I just. I'm looking at what I see. And I apologize that she did not reach out or that I don't see any attempts, or if she's reached out and called the wrong number. I don't know. But, I mean, going forward, you're welcome to reach out to me. I can give you my email address as well, if you want to forward to me and I can get it handled for you. Please do. Yeah. If you got a second, you can write my email address down and I can. You can send it to me. And if you want to give the [ORGANIZATION] a call, I'm ready. All right. It's just.

It's supposed to ring to my cell, and if I'm in a meeting, just leave a voicemail. I'll call you right back. Okay. And I got. That's correct, [PERSON_NAME]. So you can just ask for me and I'll get it figured out for you. Okay, thank you so much, [PERSON_NAME]. I appreciate it. And I will handle that today. Okay. You just give me a call with that. Just let me know how. Either way, how it goes, and then I'll go from there on my end. We'll get it figured out for you, and then I'll go ahead and I'm just going to get a temporary tag and then like a purchase order for the paperwork and I'll get it sent out for you today. Okay.

This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How may I assist you? Yeah, hi, can I speak with [PERSON_NAME], please? Yeah, give me one second. Thank you. If you're looking for a new vehicle in [LOCATION], look no further than [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. We have a wide variety of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] and sos. Yeah, hi [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Thanks for sending those two spec sheets over on the Highlander hybrid. I do have a question. One of those cars you said is in transit and the other one is there. Which one is there and which one's in transit? The green cypress. Green one is here and then the silver one is in transit. Okay, and that you expect tomorrow or the next day. Right? Give me one second. I just reloaded my screen to see if there is any update on the status. Yes, it says estimated arrival to dealership was between [TIME] to [TIME] [TIME]. All right, so you got [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Does it usually. Do they cars usually arrive on pretty much in the window? Yep, they usually do arrive in that window. And if it is out of the window, it's usually roughly anywhere from [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] at most. Okay, so that answers my first question. The second question I have is if we decided we wanted to do something but weren't fond of the color, would you be able to swap that with somebody else for a different color? No. That is one thing, especially on hybrid vehicles, we would not be able to do and especially on all wheel drive vehicles. Just because there is a nationwide through all brands shortage in the all wheel drive system right now. So there's going to be a lot more front wheel drive hybrid SUVs getting circulating to system and they just actually started trickling into our system as of last Wednesday on our RAV4. So I know the Highlanders will be next with a lot of front wheel drive only vehicles. So this is a vehicle that dealerships do not trade for or most dealerships in [LOCATION] don't even have on ground. Right. Okay. Okay. And the other question, so the one that's coming in, is that the silver one? I think? Yes. Correct. That is the silver one. Okay. All right, well, let me see. I'm waiting to hear back from the family I work for and I will let you know. If it makes sense for me to come up there this afternoon and check it out or in the next [DURATION] days, either way, I'll let you know. Oh yeah, so the one that I do have on ground right now is a green one. I know it is being shown by another [OCCUPATION]. So if it doesn't go, that one is here to take, come take a look at and if it's something that you are interested in, we can move forward. And then in regards to the silver one that I have coming in, I would definitely urge you to reach out to me as soon as possible. When you do know that is a vehicle you'll be leaning towards. Just because the first person that does put a deposit on that vehicle, it is their vehicle, right on either right. The one on ground? No, the one on ground is first come, first served. But the one that I have on a shipment truck is reserve only. So if it is something you want and we reserve the vehicle for you with a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit, that just goes towards the down payment. And even if you were going to put [MONEY_AMOUNT] down, you just get refunded that [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then if you did change your mind on the vehicle, you also get reimbursed that as well. Okay. That's just one of the policies right now. Especially on the hybrid vehicles, there are slim chances that they do touch down without being reserved. But on hybrid vehicles right now we don't really see that much touching down without being reserved. Okay, all right, well, let me see what you know. I appreciate that. I know it's tight and I'll be back in and give you some kind of direction by the end of the day. All right, sounds perfect. Yeah, just definitely feel free to reach out to me whenever you can. All right. Okay. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. No problem, [PERSON_NAME]. Talk to you soon. Bye.",failure,feature_question,Highlander hybrid,medium,False,01988467aaa246e1b424e177550454aa_transcript.json
"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. My name is [PERSON_NAME], how can I help you? Hi, [PERSON_NAME], how are you doing today? I'm good, how about yourself? I'm trying to make it try very hard. Anyway, I'm trying to see if you guys could I speak to a [OCCUPATION]? Yes, of course. Were you looking at new or pre owned, sir? Let me look at the pre owned first and see what you guys got. If you got what I'm looking for. Okay, give me one moment. Thank you. Freak. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] speaking. How may help you? Hi, how are you doing today? I'm good, how are you? I'm trying to be good. What's going on? All right, I'm calling to see if you guys have like [DATE_INTERVAL], I mean [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Tundra [DATE_INTERVAL], what is it, [DATE_INTERVAL], whatever edition or IRA Platinum. And a [DATE_INTERVAL] model specifically? Yes. You don't want the new engine? Is that. Is that what it is? No, he's not. Engine. It's a new body body style you guys make. There are some body style, new ones and they're small. The different body styles. You like the older body style better? Yes, ma' am. I like the older body style better. The only one that's older than a [DATE_INTERVAL] that I got right now is a [DATE_INTERVAL] Limited. Yes, everything other than that. Huh. And how many miles it's got? 146, 000 miles. What's the price you're asking for that? That one's going for 30,000. You ain't gonna have a tundra that doesn't run. They'll still charge 15,000 for. Say it again? I said if you find a tundra that doesn't run, they'll still want 15,000 for it. Well, I see some. I see some ones that run, but they got high mileage. I see one for 12,000. Like run. They just got high mileage on it. It got like about 2,200,000 miles on it. Well, they keep going. Yeah, things have to. Yeah, they do. I do. I just don't like the body styles any new. I like to get me a new one, but I just don't like the body styles. And then you guys don't have the new ones. They come up with the f. The 5.7 liter engine. Are they coming with 4.6? So the new ones have the twin turbo, four V6 in it. Sorry, not four cylinder. So the V8. Oh no, eight anymore. But you know, they know you get more power though in the new ones. Yeah, they have more torque they look smaller. They're really not smaller. They're the same if not a little bigger. I might have to come by. You want to look at the new one and see if you change your mind about it? Yes, the platform. Because I see you guys. You guys slash the prices on them. They used to be [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's flashed down towards [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], whatever. I don't. Not sure what you're looking at on the. I only have like, on the pre owned. I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Limited or SR5. I feel like [DATE_INTERVAL]. Is that what it is, [DATE_INTERVAL] edition? What is it what your number is again? That. That is an addition. We don't have any of those here, though. I don't see one on your. On your website. It could be. It could be something that's already sold. Okay. All right, so. All right. So you say you only got 23s, right? Say it again. You only have the [DATE_INTERVAL]. Is that what you're saying? I have again, the one [DATE_INTERVAL]. I got a handful of [DATE_INTERVAL], like 223s. No, I'm talking about you. I ain't talking about the [DATE_INTERVAL]. No, I'm talking about the. The [DATE_INTERVAL] are [DATE_INTERVAL]. You say you don't own [DATE_INTERVAL]? No, I don't have any one. Right, so your [DATE_INTERVAL] does. Flush the price. I'm not sure what you're talking about. Let me look. Are you looking at the new car or the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] prices? No, I'm looking at the truck. I was looking at the truck because I'm really interested in the. The new ones. Yes. Can you hang on one second? Yeah, yeah. Hang on one second. Hello? Hey. Yes, ma' am. Okay. All right. So if you're looking. Huh? I was gonna say, if you're looking at the new cars and you're looking at the price and it has like the line through it. That's because if you look at the bottom, it doesn't include any of the [OCCUPATION] accessories, text tag, or title. But that is the base msrp. So that's the starting price on those. Okay, so let me see what price they got, if we can get back on. So for a [DATE_INTERVAL] Platinum, what's the price that runs? So the MSRP is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I see we got one listed. That being said, with accessories, depending on what we added to the vehicle, do some math. It'll be a minimum of [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It could go up to just under [MONEY_AMOUNT]. If it also has like a [ORGANIZATION] cover for the bed though. But that base price is just going to include the msrp and then our [OCCUPATION] adds which would be the window tint, wheel locks and low jack. So when you finish putting on your price and everything in there is going to run up to like about $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's just on the platinum one. Specifically the platinum one on our website is the most expensive one. So that particular one, yes, you'd be like close to [MONEY_AMOUNT], but if you went with like the [DATE_INTERVAL], there's only [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] or like a limited that's closer to [MONEY_AMOUNT], you wouldn't be anywhere close to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So you said the this special edition and then run like you're saying [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, we've got like the SR5 listed at [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then we've got another one SR5 at [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then we get a limited at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So it just depends on which one you select. Now a lot of these are coming in. So they're not in store. We only have one in store available. You only got one in store that's available? Uh huh. And which one is that? It's the SR5. It's a white one. It's the one that's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Let me see if I can get back and see what I'm looking at because. Okay, so what this one is a pre owned and this one is saying that it is [DATE_INTERVAL] [PERSON_NAME]. So you got, you've got the new [DATE_INTERVAL] edition not in stock? No, we have some incoming that we can you know, do an order for but there's none to like look at right now. What you got to use on. I don't have any used right now on that trim level here for I can't give you the stock number. It is. What's the stock? Is that Q230-723-0738 and the green number is the VIN number is [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. It's like a black one. I think I got it. Here is the price [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes. Let me check something. I know they always come with leather interior and backup camera and navigator system and covered bed and all that kind of stuff. But I want to see how many miles you got on that for that price. That one says the miles is 3,000 miles. Let me see if it's at this location or not though. Is the last number the stock numbers A is an apple, correct? Yes. Okay. [VEHICLE_ID]. Yep. Thinking. Yes sir. So yeah, that one's not here any longer. They've already purchased it. Or they might be doing, like, an extended test drive. I might have to get with the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] to get the whole story. Okay, let me see, let me see. Let me. There's another one there, man. It might be available later if they return it. Don't like it. You know they don't like it. Right. If it's on an extended test drive, you know, it could be we needed to let them drive a car for [DURATION] [DURATION] and we just gave them that. Or it could be that. You know, they're deciding if they want to buy it. There could be a number of things going on. I just have to get with the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and find out. Right. Is there any other vehicles that you're seeing on there you want me to check on? I'm looking to see if I find me another one on there. Okay. I don't really do Tacoma. The Tacoma, I'm too small for me. I want them big trucks. What do you drive now? Right now, my driving cam. I'm driving the big truck down the road. But I need me. Do you have a personal vehicle or. No, no, no. My personal vehicle right now. So I'm looking at [DATE_INTERVAL], and they say it's a used one, so. And It's. It's a 5.5 bed. Let me see if they have any. Any more details about it. I see the product applies. The price was [MONEY_AMOUNT], and they slashed the price, so I don't know what that meant. Yeah, that just means that doesn't include any of the accessories, tax tag, or title fees. Because some people get confused and they come in and they think that's the total price, and that's really just the starting price, and then they're not so happy. So. Are you misleading your customers, ma' am, or what? Oh, we're trying not to. No new. These are new for sale. I'm looking for it. I don't. You got. I don't only see. You got one new one on there, and it's like a gold color. A gold color? Yes. It's. The stat number is. I think that Q024-82-02482. Yes. 2482. 2482. I'm not getting any results for that stock number. Q02482. Q02482. Yeah, I'm sorry. You slash the price on it in half. So I don't know, maybe if it's. If it was [MONEY_AMOUNT] and it's half? No, it's going to be maybe Turtle token. Right. Even the new vehicles. I don't see that particular one. Huh. I don't see a match for that stock number. So it is probably sold. Maybe just a fake number, then put it there. You think that's what it is? No, when cars sell, it takes like [DURATION] [DURATION] for the system to update. So it is a good idea to call, you know, before you head somewhere to see what's what, especially. Right. I'm trying to see a search inventory. Empty. Nothing there. That's the only one I saw. I don't know if you guys have any more. All I see is Tacomas and Islanders. Yeah, we got quite a few Tacomas right now. Yeah, I don't want to put Tacomas on at all. It'll be too small for me. How soon do you need something? Well, as soon as I can because I'm supposed to be home on the weekend. I wanted to, you know, see if I could find something I can come on over there, come look at, you know. You're trying to get them over the weekend. Yeah, I wanted to come up, come over there on the weekend and see what you got in stock, but it looked like you already got your Tacomas and cars and you ain't got no trucks. Yeah, as far as tundras go, I have the one new one here and I got three new ones coming in for the rest of the month. And that's it. Well, you're getting them slow in or they send them out slow or you just what? That's what you order. So [ORGANIZATION] just works off allocations so they build X amount of cars, they give them to the [OCCUPATION] and they say this is the way you can sell. Oh, wow. So we work with what we got. Oh my God. Yeah. What [DURATION] this weekend were you in? Planning to come out Saturday? Yes. Gotcha. Well, I'm up in [LOCATION]. I'm up in [LOCATION] right now. I suppose to work in [LOCATION] by Friday, so maybe tomorrow. Yeah, I would be in [LOCATION] Friday, but I don't know what time I'm going to be there. So I want to come in tomorrow. Coming Saturday. Okay. Would you want me to go ahead and set you an appointment for Saturday so we have a slot for you and then we can just update you on the inventory as we get closer to then? Yes, that could work. Okay. What time do you want me to have you penciled in for the morning or the afternoon? [TIME] [TIME]. Okay. All right, well, we'll touch base at some point tomorrow. To go over what will be here for sure on Saturday. So we kind of have a plan, and then we'll go from there. Okay. Okay. So you say you've got one. Shocking stuff. Why does it look like it's. I can. I can send you some pictures of it. It looks like this is your phone number, correct? Okay. The. Are you a texter or no. Yes. Okay. Can you text this phone number? I'm gonna give you a phone number in just a second. Maybe the soda. Sometimes I feel like I don't know how to use my own phone. What kind of phone you got? It's the iPhone, but it's too fancy for me. I don't know how to use it. Is the new one the five? I mean the. The 14? The 15? Oh, no, it's like a 12 or something. Oh, I got the 11. I want to change it out, though. I want to get the 5G. All right, you ready for the phone number? Hold on one second. Yes, ma' am. 5. If you can just text me the word yes. What? Huh? Cutest text. Yes. Did you get it? I'm trying to get it to you now. It got it. Oh, thanks. All right. Me. That's funny. You had inquired about something like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. One of my old [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] had texted you, but you never had replied, so we couldn't text you back. But now we can. All right. I was just looking at someone. I know it was here. Oh, this one is a white one, and it is a [DATE_INTERVAL] type of [DATE_INTERVAL]. And it says you are plastic price, too. What is this? These are registers. The SR5. Does they come with leather seats? Some of them do. So it's the upgraded package in the tundra. And the SR5, it doesn't come standard until you're in the Limited. So this one, I'd have to double check whether or not you do have that. All right. I feel that. A whole bunch of them over here. I still got a black one. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL], and it was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It was. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] Crewmax. [DATE_INTERVAL] edition. The Crewmax facing transit. Wait. Yes, that one's in transit. Oh, okay. Let me see what I forgot. This one is in transit. Anything that's in transit is still available for sale. We do take deposits in about 30% of our inventory. So, you know, you look at the trucks that are here, and you're like, I don't like any of these, but I do like that one that's coming in. You can always work A deal on that. Leave a deposit so that when it arrives, it's locked in your name. You don't have to worry about someone else beating you here. Okay. And these are the flare side. They look like flare side. Say it again. Flare side. Flare side. We got the. The buff fender over the back wheel. The fender over the back wheel. Yeah, the buff. The buff fender. Like the fenders are buff out. Yeah. Are they like that? Yeah, they all have that kind of same look. I know it's hard to see. Well, if you're looking at the new inventory, it's kind of hard to see what's going on because they're all stock photos. Okay. All right. Yeah. I'll come in and take a look at what you got in there on Saturday. Okay. Yeah. What if you're going to send, you know, if they would send me a truck. Say it again. You said what? Was going to send me a truck. Yeah. I'll go ahead and send you a couple new ones that will be here by Saturday. And then if you don't like any of those, we can look at the used ones and go from there. Okay. Yeah, but you ain't got no use one. We have some [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL]. Look at the prices for them [DATE_INTERVAL], though. That's because there's no 2023s. Huh? That's because we don't have any 2023s. That's why you raise up those [DATE_INTERVAL]. Because as long as you got. You see, the thing is with vehicle, with cars, I mean, it doesn't matter which company. As soon as you drive off the lot, the prices depreciate. You know, sometimes that doesn't happen anymore. Sometimes you drive it off a lot and it appreciates. Sometimes if I. Okay, if I drive that truck off a lot with. With 0 miles and come up with 100 miles, you guys are gonna want to take off price money off of it, right? Crazy times. People have made a living off of just buying and selling cars the past [DURATION] [DURATION]. You think I'm joking? I'm not. They come in here, they try to buy at our cheap, cheap price, and then they go up to one of the stores that are a little bit higher priced than us, and they'll make money off of just buying the car. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, I think I'm going to do that with mine. I just want to. From a person and I believe really doesn't like you by the style. But if that's what they have now, then have to go for it. I don't want most of those trucks that use trucks that, you know, they got high mileage on them. People with the. With the two. With like. With the [DATE_INTERVAL] and [DATE_INTERVAL]. Right. Like, they're holding on to them. Yeah. The people with the, like, relatively newer ones are holding on to them because they can't get a brand new one. There's just not a whole lot out there. But let me send you what we got and then we'll chat tomorrow. Okay? All right, thank you. No problem. Have a good [DURATION]. Are you gone? You leaving me? Yes. I gotta get back to work. Oh, I thought he was at work. I didn't work. Right. Okay, so you say. All right. So, yeah, take time with me, then sell you. Okay, yeah. I'll send you over the ones that we got. Yes, ma' am. All right. Thank you. All right. Thanks for your time. You have a wonderful [DURATION]. You too. Bye. Bye.

Just got in the office and trying to make things happen today. There you go. There you go. Well, tell you what I'm calling to look for, see if you got it. Still [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION]. 2500 [ORGANIZATION] Ultimate. It's your titanium rush metallic one. Man, that dude sold just yesterday. Sure did. Is still here on the lot. Guy hadn't picked it up yet, so I don't know. Have you seen one yet in person? I. I've not seen the 24s in person, but I've looked at them a ton online. Gotcha. Gotcha. That's what I was calling to make sure he's gonna have it on the lot before I come up there and wrote you a check for it. Well, I think I've got another one coming. I think I've got a few more coming. I need to verify that, but I do think I got a few more coming that hadn't been marked yet. They should be here any day. That Titanium Rush metallic is just freaking gorgeous. That's the only color you want? Well, I think you've got another one that I've not seen in person. It's going to be like that. It's not silver. I don't think it's called. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. They call it not set and steel. They changed the name from [MONEY_AMOUNT] steel. Sterling. Sterling metallic. Sterling metallic, yeah, yeah, Sterling metallic. Yeah. You've got that one coming that says it's on the way. I saw that. But you're one of the first groups that's actually get them actually delivered, it seems like. Well, and then what I try to tell everybody and the reason that is because. Because we're selling them so quick. As soon as we sell one, we get allocated for another one. And so it's it's, man, I, I, I can really emphasize how important it is to put your name, put your name on one. If I've got what you want, just go and put your name on it. Go get you. Because they're so limited and there are several. Like, I know I probably got another three or four people looking for that truck right now. Yeah. So yeah, no, I've been, I've been watching for them for like [DURATION] [DURATION] now. And you know, I said I want to go. It's not that I want to go write you a check. She hold $[MONEY_AMOUNT] or nothing like that, but I mean, it's almost to that point. Yeah. You know, put, put a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down on, on making sure that I, that when it shows up that it's my truck, you know what I'm saying? Is your truck. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Let me. But you say you do like the [MONEY_AMOUNT] metallic. I don't know about the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I, you know, I haven't seen the [MONEY_AMOUNT], but the, I'll tell you what. I, I'll be honest with you. The reason I liked it that the, the titanium one, it's, it's honestly, I've got a 20 set. I've got a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] F2 F250 Platinum. And you're gonna trade and it's still worth a pretty penny, so. Oh, absolutely, absolutely. That's, that's what I was gonna trade toward it. And, and just this full disclosure, I'm typically a [ORGANIZATION] person, but [ORGANIZATION] is not doing the interior remodel until [DATE_INTERVAL], and you're not going to get a [ORGANIZATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] until sometime next year at best. Yeah. And so I was like, you know what? I'm just ready for another, another truck. So, you know, you guys, you guys happen to be the winner. Winner. Winner. Well, well, let me. Well, would you, would you consider the [MONEY_AMOUNT] stimuli? I mean, would you anything other than Titanium Rush or. Now you, you still got time to come down here and look at that truck before we deliver it. But, you know, I don't know if you want to see it because it is, well on the lot. It's a, it's [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] drive for me to come see you, so. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. To not, to not drive home with one. It's a negative return on my time, you know what I'm saying? Got you on that. So. Well, let's, let's do this. Let's, let's do this. I'll probably maybe see if I can't maybe Deal a trade at Sterling. If someone's got another titanium Rush, I'm gonna look at the possibility of maybe a [OCCUPATION] trading one for you and see if I can have any luck with that because like I said, I've got a few allocations of them and you know, maybe somebody that wants. I might be able to find another [OCCUPATION] that, that somebody might want the [MONEY_AMOUNT] of thousand rather than the titanium. You know what I mean? Yeah. And now we can, we can build a trade or do something. No, Sterling. I'm kind of looking at it right now. The Sterling's not bad. I bet. Honestly the Sterling will probably look cleaner longer than that titanium. Just because the titanium is so dark that Sterling more like. Let me tell you this. I've got a buddy that bought one in that [MONEY_AMOUNT] metal. Now he bought it. He bought an AP4 in that [MONEY_AMOUNT] metallic. And I'm telling you, when I tell you that thing is gorgeous, every time I look at it, I stir it, it is absolutely gorgeous. And it probably popped better in that [ORGANIZATION] ultimate than even the other. Yeah, I don't think it is right. Yes sir, that's correct. It is now my thing. Go ahead. That [ORGANIZATION] ultimate package is just gorgeous. I love that. That smoke, that smoke mirrored out, you know, front grill and everything, man. Yes sir. This looks so good. It's beautiful, man. It really is. It's data. You know, I've been in the car business over [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] and it's hands down the most beautiful truck I've ever seen, period. I don't, I don't know what, I don't know of another truck that I've seen as gorgeous as these HD trucks that they got coming out. These ultimates, man, they just, they just gorgeous me. When do you think that that [MONEY_AMOUNT] gonna hit you? Like we're gonna land on the lot, man, it. They looking pretty close. Let me, let me do a little homework on that for you and just kind of see if I can't get an [ORGANIZATION] we. I can look online and see what status is in it. Usually if it's in. I think last time I looked it was like 3400 status, which means that it has been built and it's waiting for to be put on a truck somewhere to go to the next station or something. But yeah, let me just look, Let me just look and see what the status of it is and I'll get you back as quick as possible. And now give me your full name again, sir. Yes, [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay.

That's right. That's right. God's country. I love [LOCATION] [LOCATION], though. My gosh. That's what we. We call [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. God's country. Well, where the hogs are at. I mean, golly, Right? Any club any closer, we'd all be saying, great. Amen. Yes, sir. 09. Got you covered there. I'm gonna go ahead and text you my. My business card, [PERSON_NAME], so you'll have that. And I'm gonna go to work on this and see what I can come up with for you. All right, brother. I appreciate you. I. I'll try to hit you back within the next [DURATION] [DURATION] or so. I. Either way, you know, we'll get it. We'll get it worked out. I'm. I'm not impatient. Like I said, I got a great truck, Honestly. My truck's a fabulous truck. Yes, sir. You know, but I gotta. And I'll tell you the mileage I got, and it's my truck which says a hundred thousand miles, like 100,000, 130 miles. I don't know, you know, but it's just right at 100,000 miles. But it's a great truck. I know, I know. Pretty dang close. What it's gonna. What's gonna trade for. But what do you think you want for, [PERSON_NAME]? What I need to give you for. I want [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it. But you're gonna struggle for that. But. Because everybody wants to try to lowball me on it. But. But I know what it's worth. I mean, I can go out here on the yard. I can go. I can go sit on the side of the road and sell it for [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. I mean, it's a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] okay. And that was in [DATE_INTERVAL]. Could you do [MONEY_AMOUNT]? 12. 17. Could you do this favor for me? I'm gonna send you my biscuit. Can you send me pictures of your truck? Dang right. I can. Yeah. Send me pictures of it, of the interior and exterior. I'm gonna go ahead and try to see if I can't put a number on it. Yep. Like. And the only reason I say what. What I want for it is because I know what. You know, if I was just more patient person, I go sell it out here on the yard myself and make plenty of money. So. Yeah. But it's just easier for me sometimes, you know, because I lose that sales tax discount, you know, from the taxes that go towards the sales. So I know what I'm losing there by selling it myself. So it's. It's kind of. I try to find a happy, happy medium. Yeah. And then I don't have to deal with sellers and buyers. I know this game. Yeah. Yeah. You deal with us. You deal with us buyers [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], you know? Amen. [DURATION] [DURATION], every day. I know what you're coming from. You sound like a real reason gentlemen. So I want to work as hard as I can to make this work for you. All right? Sounds good, man. I appreciate it. And I. And I look like I got you out there? That'd be me. All right. I got you, brother.

"This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Yes, is this [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, ma' am, I'm afraid so. Yes, I was calling because. Well, I'm hoping you can. I was calling because I have a vehicle. It is a [ORGANIZATION] EQ35. It's an older model, and I had. I had picked y' all pick it up to have it to find out what was wrong with it. And your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is telling me that he doesn't know what's wrong with it, but, you know, for more money he could go in. Well, you tell me what's wrong with it. The [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay. That I was wanting to see if. Yeah, EX35, something like that. EX35. What is that? Is that an SUV? No, sir, it's a kind of. I guess it would be considered a suv. Yeah, it's like a mini suv. Oh, so small. I got you. But I was wanting to see maybe if we could. Okay. And I was wanting to see if maybe we could talk about trading in on something, because I gotta have something to run, and I took it to y' all, which makes it. I don't know what else to do. Yes. Yes, ma' am. It's got a lot of miles on it. I just purchased it myself, so I'm not sure. Oh, I see. I see. If you don't mind, give me your name and your phone number, please, ma' am. Okay. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME].

[LOCATION]. Okay. And you want to see if you can trade out. How many do you owe on it? I don't. I want nothing on it, you know. Oh, you just bought it straight out? Yeah, I paid cash for it. And that's why I said, you know, [PERSON_NAME], if I'd have known this was going to happen, I'd have just went and used my money and been down payment on a car. The thing is, you seem like you bought somebody else's problem. Well, actually, they. Yeah, they basically said that it wasn't going to be a problem, but, yeah, I guess it was. How long. How long have you had it, [PERSON_NAME]? Literally, [DURATION] [DURATION]. [DURATION] [DURATION]. Good God Almighty. Yes. Sir, you don't mind me asking, how much did you. I was trying to avoid. I was trying to avoid a.3800. Yeah, I paid [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And I tell you, that would have been a good little down payment on a car, but, yeah, I'm pretty sure we can work something out. And what kind of vehicle are you interested in? Well, I wanted a convertible, but that was if I was going to go and have a payment. So I went around to buying that little piece of crap. So I guess I'll take what I can get. At this point, I just needed to run, but I'd like to have a sunroof or a convertible, something like that. I'm getting older now. I'm ready to just chill out. Hold on one second. Sweet. You find it? Yeah, he said they charged it back to. They charged it back to the vehicle, Huh? I don't know. You have talk to him on Monday, I guess. Yeah. Okay, I'm back. All right. Yeah. Are you from around here? Yes, sir. [PERSON_NAME]. And yes, sir, I'm around. I'm. I just moved down this way from [LOCATION], but I've been. I've always lived around [LOCATION] or [LOCATION] or [LOCATION]. Somewhere in here. Okay. So do you know where we're located? I do. You're in [LOCATION]. Okay, I gotcha. Yeah, I had my car towed to my friend's house when I broke down. Okay. And then I had it towed from his house to this to y' all. And I said, I'm just losing too much money towing it around. I just need to get. Get to talk to somebody at the [ORGANIZATION] site and see what we can work out. Okay, I'm back. Now, every time they see me on the phone, they want to interrupt me. But now. Now you're just gonna use the car as a down payment. You said it's got a little over a hundred thousand miles on it. It's got some miles on. I don't know how much miles is on it. I gotcha. I gotcha. I'll get that information. I didn't even pay attention to it when. When I found it because it was running good. And he had told me that the black book, or blue book, whatever he called it, was more than what the car was worse because. Or was more than what it was costing me because. Yeah, it was a. Whatever the circumstance was, I was getting cheaper. I understand. Now the thing is, is that. You getting a call. [PERSON_NAME], where do you work at? Do you work? Yes, sir. Okay. I wish I could say I didn't. Yeah. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Well, you got a good job.

Tell me this. Do you. You Know what your basement box, what your credit score is? No, it's not good at all. It ain't good at all. Yeah, it's not good. Have you ever bought a car before? Well, I have. Yeah. I bought one before, but I didn't. I mean, I paid it. It was paid off because of a wreck. Okay. Okay. Have you ever had a repossession? I don't think so. Okay. And do you have anything that's like when you buy my car and. And they come and get it? Did I finance anything that's paid off? Have you. I don't think I ever. Credit cards or anything like that? No, sir. I've never. I've never gotten a credit card. I've never gotten a credit card. I guess what I need. Are you pretty familiar with how to. How to work a computer or your phone so that I can try to. What was that one? I'm sorry. Like a. Like a phone. You can go online on a phone if I give you a website and go on. Yeah. Okay. And.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, [PERSON_NAME]. How's it going? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. How are you today? I'm doing great. How are yourself? I'm doing good, man. Thanks for asking. Are you with new car sales? Yeah. How can I help you? So I'm interested potentially in a lease, depending on what the leasing programs are on new Camaros. I'm a Camaro owner myself as it sits, and I've been looking for a new daily driver for a little while now. And I was looking at older CPSVs and ATSVs, and I can't find one that is, like, for the mileage, what I'm willing to pay. Like, I'm not willing to pay [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] for a car with 100,000 miles on it. So I was informed the other day about how leasing programs can potentially be a good option. And I don't use this part very much. So I'm potentially exploring, like, what kind of leasing options you guys have as far as financing with excellent credit goes. Okay. Of course. Give me a second. Let me get you one of my [OCCUPATION]. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, how's it going, man? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. How are you? I'm doing good. His name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How's it going today, man? You doing all right? Pretty. I'm doing pretty good. How are you? I'm doing fine, man. I might be doing even better if you can hook me up with some information about your leasing programs on new Camaros right now. I am an existing Camaro owner myself. I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] that's pretty highly modified. It's got a blower on it and whatnot. I've been looking for a new daily driver for a little while now, and I was looking at older CTSVs and ATSVs. The problem that I'm having is with the car market today. I'm not willing to pay [MONEY_AMOUNT] or $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] for [DURATION] [DURATION] on a car that has 88,000 miles on it. Right. So I'm. I don't use car very much. I'm entertaining leasing because I was scrolling through some stuff the other day, and somebody had mentioned that they had gotten a lease on a newer LT1 trim Camaro SS for fair price for, like, [DURATION] [DURATION]. And that's kind of all I would really need. So I'm exploring the leasing options and what you guys have going on as far as people with excellent credit [PERSON_NAME], I'm definitely entertaining it. If it's going to be something to where I'm going to pay [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], I'll just go buy the fucking car and eat it at that point. But I'm definitely interested in hearing what you guys have as far as incentives go for leasing right now and if I can get a good deal on a car. Right. I got you, I got you. I know the current leasing runabout, I want to say right around about [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus after tax as far as a lease goes. [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus? Yeah, so I mean you're looking at somewhere around there. I mean that's after tax. I mean as far as leasing options. But it also depends on if you do the, if you do everything that's required as far as the, the leasing option goes. Because with the, with the leasing. Yeah, right, exactly. Correct? Yes sir. Correct. Yes sir. So I mean, yeah, I use, I used to sell used cars so I'm familiar with finance. Okay, perfect. Yeah. So then yeah, everything is going to be the same. We do have a current lease program going on so we would be able to honor that lease if you're. Let me see if we have a LT1. How soon were you looking to do something? Yeah, and I'm definitely curious. Like I said, I'm a Camaro owner myself and I have. My Camaro is a manual transmission but I am. And I'm a manual guy through and true. So like. And I know a lot of those LP ones do come with manuals but I am curious to drive the 10 speed cars because I've seen some modified 10 speed cars and they are the fucking truth when it comes to like high horsepower and speed. So like not that I would modify at least anyways. Right. But like if I were to buy it out after the fact, like if I liked it, like you know, give me, give me something to try because I know that I'll be in the market for a newer Camaro at some point. You know, I just don't. Yeah. Feel like buying one right this second. You know what I mean? I've been loosely ZL1 shopping for a little while too. But it's, you know, one of those things. Right. So I mean if I can try them out, you know, interesting. Then who knows, I may fall in love with the car by the time the lease is over. And I know that residuals are pretty typically pretty good on, on hot rods like that like Camaro. I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't be in the negative, so. But if it's around [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], I'll be completely straight up honest with you. I think I'm interested. If I can get even. Even below that, like, that would be incredible. Like I said, I'm aware of where I stand as far as credit goes. I'm well above the excellent category, so I should be able to. I should be able to qualify for the best deal that you guys can get as far as the financing goes. So I'm not getting approved. Okay, I got a quick question. I mean, interrupt. Are you looking for a LT1 or are you looking for one LT LT1, not a one LT. I do not want any. I don't want anything. Okay, cool. Okay, first. And I misquoted you on the. The leasing option, then for it. As far as the pricing, because the leach option I just told you about is for. Hold on one second. It is for the. Oh, wait, no, it is for the LT1. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, you're just looking at the right one. Okay. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. Yeah. So if it's an LT1 trim, not a one. LP trim, I don't want the baseball. I got you. Ye. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. SSLT1. I'm interested in it. And if it's around that $[MONEY_AMOUNT] range, we. We can have a conversation. If it starts to push that [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], I'll go buy a car. You know what I mean? Like, just being honest with you, right. I think I'll rent one for the price that I can buy that bitch for. You know what I mean? So, like, yeah, so there are. There's an LT1 coming in. I have to look and see if my [OCCUPATION] can get a delivery date on the [DATE], because there's no delivery date posted for it yet. So I have to just wait for that to come in. To pursue the lease announcements would be the only thing with it. If there's a leasing option posted forward saying that it's going to come in by before the end of the month, and if it comes in next month, I don't know what the rebates and this center going to be as far as the next. Yeah, right, right. The change, Right. Correct. Yes, sir. What I can do is I can find out about this one that I'm looking at. It's a LT1. It's a manual. It's a black exterior. I can find that about to see. Yes. Okay. Gray interior, I'm assuming gray cloth, correct? Yes, sir. Okay. All right, I'm into that. If you want to take down notes. As long as it's not fucking red, I will take it like as long as it's not red. I can't stand red. Okay. If you want to take down notes in my number, honestly it beggars can't be choosers, right? But I tell you what, I'm in love with vivid orange. So if a vivid orange one comes through, we're, we're having serious conversations. How do you feel? How would you feel about a 1 SS vivid orange? I mean if I can get a similar deal, right? Because I know it's a more expensive car and it's I that the one ss because it says SS on the side and has a different face, it costs $[MONEY_AMOUNT] more. But like, like if I can get it for a similar deal. Yeah, I mean the cars are sexy. I dig them. Like their SS front end is better than the LT front end. Although the more I look at them, the more I start to like them. I just don't like the, I don't like the. Lt's. I don't like those hash marked headlights. I like the, I like the pan style ones that are on the SS cars. So that is definitely attractive to me. But however, that's besides the point. That's not what you asked me. I mean I'm not opposed to that necessarily. But honestly like I'm kind of like I already have an ss, you know, so like having a different edition would make me feel a little bit better about buying another Camaro. Gotcha. Okay. Completely understand. Okay, yeah, for sure. Like I mean I'm entertaining, I'll entertain looking at it. And if it's a 10 speed car, I want to drive it, I really do because like I said, I'm a manual guy through and true. But if those 10 speeds are the truth, like, like the Internet says they are, like I might entertain one of those as well, you know. I got you for sure. I do have a vivid orange SS here. I'll take some pictures of it over to you so that way you can leave, you know, get an idea of what it looks like. Okay. I'm assuming you guys don't have any leftover 22s? No sir. No sir. Yeah, I figured as much. Not in today's world. Right? Yeah, yeah, I can take some pictures of that one, send it over to you and I can also go working on and find out more about this, the other L21 Camaro that we have coming in to make sure that it's not sold. Because customers normally put deposit out on vehicles before they come in. Nowadays So I could definitely work on the ride and try to see if you were if that one. I wouldn't need an allocation for it, would I? Well, no, not necessarily. I would have to just put the numbers together for you on it and put the, the deal together for you. That'd be the only thing. Okay. Yeah, so I should. The only time you would need a allocation for something is if you want something like built a specific way. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I guess I was going to order it. Okay, got it. Yeah. I mean, if you could send me information on both of those, like, I, I'm seriously considering it, especially like around that price point. And like I said. I know, I know you probably hear it all the time. I heard it all the time as a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] too. But like, I'm not worried about getting finance. Like, it'll get through. I just need, I want to accomplish a goal, right? So that's if we can be around there, you know, you hit me around the [MONEY_AMOUNT] range. Dude, seriously, like, we're, we're talking about a deal. Okay, hit me. We're probably not. Probably just go buy a car. Like that's just, that's just where I'm at. You know what I mean? So if you guys have incentives and rebates and all the other shit that gets me, like whether it's a [DURATION] [DURATION] term or a [DURATION] [DURATION] term, I could care less. I just, I want a nicer daily driver. All I do is I travel for work, right? So I go to and from the airport, dude, that's all the fucking car gets. And then like a little trip here and there, right? So like, I don't, I'll put miles on the car. I'm not worried about going over the mileage on the, on the lease and all that stuff. Like, I just want a nicer car. I do know that I want another Camaro at some point, but this is a good way for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] try it, but it has to make sense for me financially, right? So. Gotcha. For sure. I know you probably hear it all the time. Oh, I can buy. Because I heard it all the time too, when I was a thousand. But I promise you, like, if you're, if you're, if you're serious with me and we can get like in that range, like I'm, I'm interested right now. So I got you. How many miles are you looking for? Oh, it can be, it can be the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It can be the lowest one. It doesn't need to be. It doesn't need to be crazy by any means. I don't need the max. I don't need like the 20,000 or anything like that. I think I've driven 20,000 miles in the last [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. Okay, for sure then. Yeah, I'll definitely put something together for you. [PERSON_NAME] on the wall. We see what we can come up with. What's a good phone number or email for you? I can email orders information as well too. Yeah, I'll give you both. I'm not. I'm not afraid of that. You seem like a nice enough guy. My number is [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay. And then your email code. And then will you put together like a. I know you can't do it without pulling credit and all that other, but is it possible to put together like a mock deal on that one just. Just so I can see like what ballpark I'm going to be in? Yes, sir. I can put together just some. Some rough draft numbers for you and send them over. Yeah, yeah, right, exactly like, that's okay. I understand that. I'm just trying to get a ballpark of the number because, like, I'm a Camaro guy. I know I'm gonna like another Camaro. Like, I'm good there. You know what I mean? I do want to drive them and whatnot, but it's a numbers thing for me. Like, so if you can put together a mock deal and I can look at it and I've never leased before, so I will have questions, you know, but like if the math is math, we'll be. Yeah, so if the math is math and we'll be all right. And like, like I said, it can be. It can be short term, low mileage. Like it's. We're. We're good. Like I'm chasing a payment, truthfully. Okay, I got you, [PERSON_NAME]. I got you. I'll put it something. I'll put something together for you, man, and we'll see what we can do. And then let me check on this, this Camaro that I have here on the show before. If it is a 10 speed, would you like to come in and at least test drive that one to see what it looks, see how it feels? Yeah, yeah, I want to try them. I do want to drive a 10 speed car. I don't just want to hot rod your shit, you know, because I am a real buyer. But yeah, I definitely. I'm curious because I know the manual is a gangster. I have a manual now. So, like, we're. We're good there. The only thing that's really Cool about the new manuals to me is obviously they hold more power than the old ones used to, but they, they got that no lift shift and I heard that that's a blast. So I'm curious about that. But I am curious about the 10 speeds because I'm a manual guy through and through and I've heard nothing but great things about the 10 speed and how fucking fast those cars are. So I'm definitely curious. For sure. For sure. Well, yeah, let me put you on the brief hold real quick before we hang up. Let me just check and see what this one is because it's right here on the [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. So let me see as far as if this is 10 speed or 8 speed. It's the right color regardless. I'm into it already. Okay, for sure. Hold on one second, buddy. Hold on. Sure, sure. There's. Okay. You there? Yes, I am. Oh, okay. So I do. The orange one is here. The orange one is a 10 speed automatic. The orange one is sold. But I do have another one here that's a 10ft automatic as well. So if you want to come in and travel, it's a rapid blue. I don't know that one for sure is. That's a 10 speed automatic. So if you wanted to come in and test that one out, you're more than welcome to come in and test that one out. Is it a. Is it a 1 SS car 2 or a 2 SS? I believe this one's a 2 SS. The rather than the one that I have. Okay. It's a 2 SS. That's probably a little out of my price range, but I'm curious so like if that's okay to drive it. Like I would love to drive it. But like if that's like if that's a waste of your time, dude, like you can tell [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] off right now. They won't hurt my feelings. I'm here till [TIME], man. So you're more than welcome to come in at any time. So I gotta do what I have to do. Yeah, I hear you. I just don't. I don't want to, you know, waste your time. You feel like I'm [GENDER_SEXUALITY]. You're all good, buddy. You are all good. Because I know how it is. I've been there, dude. You know what? I can come in tomorrow morning. I live up on [LOCATION] in the [LOCATION] and I'm flying back from [LOCATION] [LOCATION] tomorrow. So I tonight I'm flying back. So I can, I can come in tomorrow morning. I can come in tomorrow morning. If you can give me the details on the. On the LP1s lease. Like, that'll. That'll pique my interest a little bit. Like, you got me on the hook right now. Like, was that [MONEY_AMOUNT] range? But if you can. Like, if you can give me something saying that, like, if you. If. If you have this, then you can get that kind of thing, like, then I'll. I'll be a little bit more inclined to want to show up. You know what I mean? If it's like you put together a deal for me and it's like, yeah, so here. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I mean, to cut you off. I apologize. I'm sorry. No, no, you good, you good, you're good. I'll be rambling. Dude, it's all good. You're good. Here's what I do. I'll get you the build sheet for the LT1, and I'll find out if it's still available, and then I'll email that over to you. So that way, at least you have the bill sheet. So they said all the specs for it. And then I'll also see if my [OCCUPATION] can put the numbers together for it as well, too. And I'll get that. That's sent over to you. And then I'll take some pictures of the blue one that I have in stock, so that way you can at least see what it looks like. And then that way you can come in and test drive that one, and I'll have the keys for it ready, pull it up for you, ready to go as well. To. Okay, Slick. Yeah, that'd be awesome. Yeah, because that's. That's really what's gonna sway me. Left or right? Right is I got. I gotta get a payment. So if you. I mean, if you can put a mock deal together where, you know, best case scenario, like, you know, give me. Give me a couple options. So, like, let me see, like, if it ends up being, like, real cheap, like, in the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Like, see. Let me. Let me see a couple. Couple options, right? Like, if that's. I got you for sure. But what I'm looking for, man, is, like, shortest term, [DURATION] [DURATION] is okay with me. Like, I. Like I said, I use it minimally. So, like. So [DURATION] [DURATION] will probably fly by if I like the car at the end of it. Honest to God, the residuals are so good, I'll probably end up buying the thing, like, at that point. Like, you know.

"Thank you for calling on [ORGANIZATION]. How am I direct your call? Yes, I had gone to your website. I was talking to a [PERSON_NAME]. I had given her a lot of stuff. We are looking for a car, see what inventory you have. If I could talk to someone. It was all hung up and can get back to that chat. So I decided to call my [MARITAL_STATUS] and I. Okay, just make it a call right now. Okay. One moment, let me get your [OCCUPATION]. Thanks for choosing gun [ORGANIZATION] We Good afternoon, [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], how may I help you? Hello, my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. My [MARITAL_STATUS] name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. He was on a chat with your website regarding a search for HRV Ex L [ORGANIZATION]. Yes ma' am. Yeah, and she asked us do you prefer new or pre owned? Well, we were looking for new. I don't know if you have any available. However, we will consider pre owned, sir. And this is what we will consider. We will consider pre owned only if it has been pre owned only by [ORGANIZATION] as a rental to accommodate customers who take their cars for repairs. And during repairs a car is provided and that's how we got acquainted. We drove the HR vexl and we really liked it and so we're inquiring about it. I don't know if you have such but if I were to buy a used one, my [MARITAL_STATUS] and I we would like to have a service car repair history and any history of crashes or anything like that need to be provided to us. It would be very bad if I were to find later on that I buy a car. And you know that history is withhold from us. We're not in the time of our lives to play around. So we are a seasoned couple looking for a car and we want a good car. And can you accommodate our search to help us? Yes ma' am. So as far as new, I do not have an EXL in stock. I do have one coming in actually it looks like I have two coming in. Price. One's price at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. They'll probably be here in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. You can leave a deposit to secure it if that's something you would like to do. And then as far as any used ones, pre owned by [ORGANIZATION]. You know what I'm talking about. I don't know what they're called, but loaners. Yeah, they're loaners. Loaners. Okay. We don't want a loaner that has been crashed or has a history of so many repairs that I'm getting a lemon. Right? Doesn't look like we have any at the Moment. But Yeah, there's no HRVs out there, but I do have that one that's going to be coming in, but that's really about it at the moment. Okay, what color is that one? It says gray, but let me get the exact name for you. Give me one second. I just have to put it in the system here. So it's that modern steel metallic. So that dark gray. Okay. I think we drove a modern steel metallic. If we were to go, could you show us one that looks like that modern steel metallic that you already have? Even its pre owned so that we can verify if that's the color that we were looking at. We were really impressed with one. It was a dark gray and I think it said modern still metallic on the write up that it had, but I'm not sure. But if we go, you could show us one, right? I could. The only ones I would have is those loaner cars, but I could show you that. Okay. And what's the color of the interior of the car that is coming in? It'll be black. Okay. Okay. And. And what, what material would it be? Leather. Leather. Leather. People, the exo only comes with the leather. Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay, I'm going to tell you something. What would be, if any, we would have a trade in. We would have a [ORGANIZATION] Civic. [ORGANIZATION] trade in, which is a [DATE_INTERVAL] in a recent hailstorm. It had some damage and we're waiting for [ORGANIZATION] to give us the money to have that done. It's in the hood at the top. It's a moderate damage. However, maybe you want to take it in without the repair on the top. I don't know how much we would lose if we would better repair it and just get it over with and then trade it in or if the loss would be too much. It doesn't have many mileage too many miles on it. Let me ask my [MARITAL_STATUS] because he had to do some business and he was talking to a person. I don't think he's even. Honey. Oh, there you are. Hey, can you tell me, I'm talking to a gentleman from [ORGANIZATION], how many miles does our [ORGANIZATION] have? About 36,000. Okay. You heard it. Yeah. The [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] that we have has about 36,000 miles on it. So that is something that is amazing, I think for [DATE_INTERVAL]. So that's what we have. And there's a big, big great possibility that our payment would be a cash payment. Therefore, I wonder if that would make a price adjustment on our favor. It would be the same Reason being where one price store. What that means is we give our best price right up front. So regardless, you know, someone has bought several cards from us or you know, first time buyer. Everyone gets the same fair price. I see, I see. Okay, your name is. And I'm going to give you my name and my email and. And then maybe set up something. Your name was Mr. I'm so sorry, it was quick. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, Mr. [PERSON_NAME], your last name, [PERSON_NAME] is going to be [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, that's [LANGUAGE] and [LANGUAGE]. Okay. All right. Mr. [PERSON_NAME], [LOCATION]. How do you say it, please? I'm sorry. No, that's perfect. That's perfect. Okay. All right. And the price on that would be. And of course there would be some value to our car for sure for trading and I don't know if you recommend fixing it or trading in it as that. It's hard. You said it's very minor. So I would definitely moderate. I would see. Did they already come out, take a look and say how much. How much was like the hell damage like how much come in. We called them and it appears that you know, they're overwhelmed with claims because of the [DURATION] [DURATION] ago or [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, something like that. So they will be doing that. We're waiting for them. But. But you are gone [ORGANIZATION], right? Okay, so there's. There's other [ORGANIZATION] places too, right? There is. You say. When you say the inventory that you have, it's only as related to you. Right? Because the other inventory. Correct. All right, but let me see if I were to call you back, sir, what was that number? I. I dialed it. They put me through you. Could you give me my. I'll give you my cell phone number. You ready for it? Yes. Going to be [PHONE_NUMBER] area code. Okay, let me repeat. Correct. Now let me, let me say something else. Actually what I'm going to give you is my [MARITAL_STATUS] and my name and our. What would you like? Do you want anything? It looks like I found you in the system here. So your cell phone. That's correct. And then are you. Your email here is [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Is that still correct? That's correct. I want to tell you something about that phone number. That's a home line, therefore it does not take text. Yes ma' am. So you have to call us and leave a message and we'll leave it back for you. We'll call back to you and if anything comes up and we might be interested in this one that you just mentioned. But we need to have a good evaluation on our car. And I don't know if this is a route to go, you know, because sometimes if you do it on your own, you might get more money and all that. There's a lot of issues. But we want to move quickly on it. As I know the inventory is low, very limited. Yes, yeah. And let me ask you, I don't know, you know, [OCCUPATION] are they do their end of the bargain in their own way. I want somebody that is will be honest with us. Let me ask you, are these cars quite reliable? The mileage? Can you give me any write up on it or any sales pitch on it? This is the second generation of this model new redesign and we haven't been able to keep one on the lot. This alongside with our [ORGANIZATION] Civic. We don't have any on the actual lot to even show customers besides the loaner cars or sometimes some pre owned. And I actually got my mother in law HRV not too long ago. But yeah, this redesign has been very, very popular and a lot of people are leaving deposits on them before they even arrive. And okay, what have they redesigned? The whole body style. So the previous one is probably what you were in as a loaner car, but they changed the whole look of it for the [DATE_INTERVAL]. Did it contain the spaciousness that it had before? Bigger, Slightly bigger. How much bigger? I'd have to get the exact dimensions, but it's for sure is, you know, bigger, probably about a foot longer. Oh dear. Okay. Does it have a backup camera? Yes, ma' am. Back in [DATE_INTERVAL] that's when [ORGANIZATION] became standard with the, the backup cameras. What happens if we leak a deposit and when it comes in we don't like it? There's something about it that we don't like. Can we get our deposit back? We are currently doing non refundable deposits only because the inventory shortage. So when we put the deposits we want to, you know, we want to make sure that we do get it out in a timely manner because that's how [ORGANIZATION] gives us even more inventories. Okay. That's the thing. If a person puts a deposit and there's a lot of people wanting one, there's going to be a fast turnover of that car. But if it comes in and I sit on it and I can't, [ORGANIZATION] has a problem for me. I've had [ORGANIZATION] Civics, okay? And the [ORGANIZATION] Civic is fine. I love it. But I'm getting older now. It's hard for me to get Out. You know, the one that we're talking about makes it much more easy to get out. We also have a [ORGANIZATION], and that's even bigger, and it's easy to get out. Now, the thing with the [ORGANIZATION] is when I back up, and I have had [ORGANIZATION] all my life, when I back up, you have to look over the shoulder. And I'm a short girl. So there is the back window. The back of the back window on the right, as I am a driver. And I'm looking to my right to look over. And I look on the left, you know, mirror, and I look on the back to see there's a car on that lane. It's always blocking. It's just so blocking because it's so high. I don't know if anybody has ever complained about that. I think I read an article on that, though. But that's my problem. And I'm just hoping that this model and I kind of. I could get into one of the models there. If I were to see you, you could let me see a model. Because I didn't drive to the last one. My [MARITAL_STATUS] did, the one that we put provided as a service car. I didn't drive it because I didn't think we would be interested. We really liked it. My [MARITAL_STATUS] loved driving. But I never. I don't know if I. Because if I'm driving it, I'm always terrified about that little blind spot. So I don't know if they remodeled that. Like I said, it does have different styling. But I will say this, too. It does have the. On that one that I was telling you about that's coming into [LOCATION], does have the blind spot monitor. So it will be a little orange light on both sides of the car. So when someone's in your blind spot, it turns orange and use a blinker and someone's there. It'll beep at you and alert you that someone you know right there. Okay, well, we need to get into one of. Walk over there and get into one and make sure that that's what we want. Because it was. If you look at the record, it was sometime back when we were given that service card for those [DURATION] [DURATION] or so. And before we put a deposit. Deposit. We would like to at least see one that is approximate to that and, you know, sit in it. Would that be a possibility? It's hard. I have one that someone has a deposit that they won't be coming here until Thursday. I could let you sit in that one. But other than that, every single one that's going to be coming in within the next [DURATION] [DURATION] or weeks has deposits, so we won't have one to actual. Well, if we were to pick the one that you're talking referring to. Yeah, we would be able. I know it's there. We're not going to drive it, obviously, but the feel for it, the looking at it and seeing how it is, that would help us make that decision quickly. Yes, ma' am. I have it here if you wanted to come take a look. Okay. I will talk to my [MARITAL_STATUS] about that. And I gotta check the other stores to see if they have one on stock because I would like to get my. Get it over with and see. Well, we also have to know what we're gonna get for [ORGANIZATION] Civic. Right? What do you. Yeah, so there's a little bit of issues. You can help me with that if we go in the [ORGANIZATION] Civic and give us an idea of what we could get for that. Yes, ma' am. Okay. I will call you back, Mr. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Yeah, you have my cell phone there, so just let me know. Thank you. Thank you very much. You're welcome.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME] speaking. Hi, [PERSON_NAME].

Okay, so yes, it's a 4x4 Turismo. Sorry, we sold that other one. And let me get you pricing on that. One second. Watch it. Hello, [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, sorry about that. Got my calls for. Okay, that one we have for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, thank you very much. So that's what we got on it. And if you have any questions, I will send not an email. That's a little rich. Yeah, it's a little. Yeah, they are. These are up. Yeah, you can find. Look, go to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. They have some 22s left. Okay. They're up in the [LOCATION]. They're looking for an ion which just has the battery pack, not the generator. So I'm hoping that they have a. So I don't know what they have. Yeah, if you want. If you want that lower number, find the. Find the 20. I mean two. Because that's the only place they'll. Because these guys manage their pricing. Oh, so they have. They think. They think. Yeah, they think we have it too low. Yeah, they don't like us lowering the price that much. So you. You can't get those for like a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The use the 22s. Yes, sir. But not that one. Not this one, unfortunately. But not what we. We just started carrying them. But I know that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] has them up [LOCATION], the real old ones. And those are in the [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT] range, depending on what you're looking for. But they have some 22s left. They do. Okay. In pleasure way, I can probably get you to that price range, but not on the grudge. Yeah, no, I'm really into the [ORGANIZATION]. I've watched Like a bunch of videos on YouTube and the quality seems to be pretty superb. And I like that it doesn't have a lot of cutouts. And there's a lot of things to it that I prefer on that rig even to other things. So, I mean, I'm pretty mind set up on the [ORGANIZATION]. I'm just. Oh. You know, that the fact like they, they, I understand they want to protect their, they want to be like, you know, the high quality, like I get what they want to be like, but it's just a little rich still, you know, to me. Yeah. And, and, and look, a company like us, we carry all the levels. We have three or four units below this. We have all the stuff. So that's the price point. This is for the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] buyer. So the next level down is [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. We got the rebel140. Okay. And what are those sticker got? And what's the factory price? I mean, MSRP about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. They are that high? Yeah, something like that, yeah. Okay. Just not as nice. I mean, they're cool if you're on the road, I guess. I mean, if you're. Well, it's a completely different, It's a different setup. The Revel is free outdoors, very simplistic. You're looking. I want the Firefight super high end crew. Yeah. I want, I want Firefly. I want the, I want to be able to roll my blinds down on my phone, you know, like that's, that's how I want it and that's what I, if you're, if you're, if you're on this. I do recommend. Look, look at the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] stuff and look at the [LOCATION] stuff. It's, it's, it's not the same [LOCATION]. I'm not super, I'm not, I'm not opposed to [LOCATION], but I'm gonna, I'm gonna wait. I mean, I'm not super. I mean, I'm ready to roll with like in the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. No, I hear you, I hear you. To try it out. Look, let me, I'll do some research on this [PERSON_NAME] and let me put something together for you and I'll send you information. I have your number. It's going to be in my system. Thanks. I will text you some stuff and, and we'll take it from there and just wait. We might bring down once. Yeah. Huh. Okay. Yeah. And I'm gonna, I'm going to my [LOCATION] [LOCATION] condo in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], so I'm probably going to pass by there just to look at the rig all the time or should I just pretend like I'm nobody? I will just. I'm gonna be there tomorrow. No, no, no, you're fine. Let's let us take care of you. Yeah, I'm gonna be there tomorrow and then I'm off Thursday, Friday. If you think that's the [DURATION] to come in, let me know once you have my info. And that way I can set you up with the right guy, a guy who won't be pushy. He'll show you. Okay. You know what I mean? That kind of stuff. Okay, so we ain't great. Can you just shoot me up? Shoot me. Shoot me an email or. I don't know if you got it. Yeah, I'm gonna shoot you. I'm gonna shoot you a text. Hold on, let me see. A little. A little slow today on the. Hold on one sec. All right, so let's see if we got you in here already. [PERSON_NAME] [EMAIL_ADDRESS], Two E's. Yeah, yeah, two E's. And I have [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. And you're out in the desert, correct? Yeah, I'm in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. All right, cool. So, yeah, why don't we do this? I'm going to send you a text right now with my info on it. I'm going to put together an email just with the listing on the coach and the sale price. And then I'll do some research and find out kind of when I know they're going to come down in price if we don't sell them that kind of stuff. Because we just took this line on, I don't know, maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. And we're kind of trying to know how they operate. But I will be in touch. Yeah, they're like, sorry, we're just gonna put you on back order. We're not shipping you any units because you're selling them too cheap and you're up the margins. That's. Well, they get that. That's their game. Yeah, like when they. When we first got the first three, we had them in. We had them in the [MONEY_AMOUNT] something or the [MONEY_AMOUNT] something. And right there was arguing and other [OCCUPATION] were calling. I talked to one of the [OCCUPATION] from [ORGANIZATION] up [LOCATION]. He said, what the hell are you guys doing?

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may [PERSON_NAME] be of assistance? How you doing, [PERSON_NAME]? This [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, how's it going? I'm doing all right. [PERSON_NAME] just had [DURATION] question. [PERSON_NAME] was trying to see. Well, [PERSON_NAME] was just trying to see what was all covered in my warranty in the car one. Okay. Okay. Let me try to look it up. What was the telephone number you used when you purchased your vehicle? [PERSON_NAME] think it was [PHONE_NUMBER]. Give me just [DURATION] moment. Let's try this. Spell your first name for me once more. You said it's [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Last name [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, [PERSON_NAME] just forgot the [PERSON_NAME]. That's why. Okay, now let me do this. What is the best telephone number for you? [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER]. Yep. You still got that. But the best number right now is this one. Give me just [DURATION] moment. And then. What's going on with your car? Were you just curious or like. Yeah, no, [PERSON_NAME] was trying to see. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME] was trying to see what was just covered in it. Just in case, like, nothing's going on with it or. No, yeah, [PERSON_NAME] was like some. [PERSON_NAME] don't know what was going on with the engine. Was there [DURATION] check engine light? No, it wasn't always. No, it was just tripping for [DURATION] second, but it's back. [PERSON_NAME] was just trying to make sure, like, what's. What is comfort. Just in case. Okay. Okay. Give me just [DURATION] moment. So I'm pretty sure it sounds like. Oh, yeah. Heck, yeah. So pretty sure you had the [OCCUPATION]. Platinum coverage. So the [OCCUPATION] is your extended warranty company through assurance. But all you need to know, it's going to be the [OCCUPATION]. You do have the platinum coverage. Let me do this. It's going to protect you from any mechanical failures. So your engine's covered, your transmission's covered. Anything electrical seals and gaskets. [PERSON_NAME] think it kind of went up. It's repeated. Say it again. [PERSON_NAME] said my phone had kind of went out. Oh, you're okay. You're okay. No worries. Here, here, here. So you are protected mechanically. So I'm gonna. Did you want me to text you the brochure, [PHONE_NUMBER], or did you want me to text it to this new number? You could take [PHONE_NUMBER] number. Okay, perfect, because I'm going to text you extended warranty. There we go. I'm going to send you [DURATION] direct link and then it's going to cover. So you have the platinum coverage. It's going to cover. So [DURATION] powertrain is engine and transmission. So you're getting the full Platinum coverage. So it's going to be the engine, transmission, anything related to the front wheel drive, rear wheel, any 4x4 action, your steering, such as, you know, excuse me, let me see. It says, like bearings, bushings, [OCCUPATION] arms, all that good stuff. Anything related to the steering, anything electrical, air conditioning, such as compressors and mounting brackets, pulley systems, condensers. It doesn't necessarily cover Freon, which is used to just keep the car cool, so to say. But as long as your compressor is working, then you're all good. And then on occasion, we've just got to put [DURATION] can of free on in the car from time to time. But your front suspension is covered. Brakes, such as master cylinders and brake lines, not brake pads or brake rotors. And then seals and gaskets, which is you got the top half, the bottom half of your engine, and the seals right in the middle to keep all the fluids in there. Then you also have like the entertainment system and all that as well. So if anything does arise, let me know. We can get you down to our shop and set up an appointment with them. They'll probably have you drop the vehicle off and [DURATION] heads up. You know, there is [DURATION] little diagnosing fee. It could be, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But let's say you have [DURATION] $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deductible. [PERSON_NAME] don't know without the paperwork sitting in front of me. But if you have [DURATION] $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deductible, they, you know, in any place you go is going to charge you to, you know, hook it up to their system, run it through their computer or whatnot to really pinpoint what's going on. You know, if it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT], diagnosis fee and then your deductible, so you know, what you pay first and then let the warranty cover the rest. You know, even [DURATION] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] is going to save you [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] in the long run. Essentially, where I'm going with this is if you pay [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] up front for them to diagnose it, then Your deductible is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. They subtract what you paid for the diagnosis fee, they subtract that from the deductible. So with that being said, if it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT] that you pay up front for them to look at it, then Your deductible is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Then at the end of the [DURATION], you only owe 150. So if you do ever need our service shop, definitely let them know, hey, [PERSON_NAME] purchased from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. And ultimately [PERSON_NAME] do have the extended warranty and the [OCCUPATION], platinum coverage. Now, [PERSON_NAME] wanted to follow up with that. You know, if you got an oil light that says, you know, hey, you know, change fluids and all that. Now, keep in mind, we changed all the fluids, checked all the fluids, topped everything off, made sure you were good to go before you took home your vehicle. Like, you know, [DURATION] couple months from now, if you get any. If you need any work done, essentially, [PERSON_NAME] would highly recommend just utilizing our service shop. If you know somebody, you know, [PERSON_NAME] can set up an appointment to have my car from. Looked at. Yeah. [PERSON_NAME] mean, if you feel something's going on with it, [PERSON_NAME] would highly recommend, you know, getting it down to the shop. It's [DURATION] lot easier if there's like [DURATION] check engine light or if you could really kind of tell them what's going on so they know exactly what to look for, where's the place look. And [PERSON_NAME] just take the car down there and tell them that [PERSON_NAME] got the protection plan and [PERSON_NAME] just tell them y' all name. You just let them know you got the warranty. Yeah. All right. And then where's the place located? Sure. So you know where our location is? [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah. What you would do if you were pulling out of the parking lot, you just make [DURATION] left and you go all the way right there? Yeah. Yes, sir. Right next door to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] on [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] and [LOCATION]. Yes, sir. So. And maybe sometime next [DURATION] starting Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, you know, try to drop it off earlier in the [DURATION] if there is [DURATION] problem, if it's like really acting up on you. What. What was going on? Could you describe the issue to me maybe, or when [PERSON_NAME]. When [PERSON_NAME] had got off work last night and. Okay. In the car, like, it was like running high. It just. Like it just said. Yeah, it said like, service engine needed. And then like when [PERSON_NAME] popped my hood open, it was like kind of smoking [DURATION] little bit. Was it really? But it's. But it's oil, though. Okay. Did somebody check your oil? Maybe the dipstick came loose or maybe. Well, let's do this, because [PERSON_NAME] don't even know. We're both not. Yeah, go ahead. [PERSON_NAME] said no. I've been at work. [PERSON_NAME] work that office. [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. Heck, yeah. So let's do this. Let's try to maybe get your vehicle down to [ORGANIZATION], which is my service shop. Maybe let's try to set something up Tuesday. So the best way to really get an appointment, because sometimes they're away from the phone down there because they got the upstairs with the, you know, where they set the appointments and all that. And then downstairs they got all the bays and all that. So they're always bouncing back and forth. Is there [DURATION] time in which you can maybe, you know, go in there, set up an appointment with them and try to have them. You know, [PERSON_NAME] don't. So here. If you go in there on usually any [DURATION] of the [DURATION], early at like [TIME] is when they open. Then you want to try to do. Now, you know, Monday's [DURATION] holiday, so Tuesday, they might be backed up. Are you available maybe Wednesday morning sometime or something or. Yeah, I'm available Wednesday or Tuesday, but I'm available Thursday. My off [DURATION] is Thursday. So [PERSON_NAME] don't know if that'll probably be like. If you. Why don't you do this maybe? Are you working Wednesday, though? Yeah, try to do this Tuesday morning. Go up there Tuesday morning, maybe. So here's what I'm thinking. Ultimately, my goal is to have your vehicle down there Thursday, when you're off and not needing [DURATION] car. You know, if you can go up there Tuesday morning, talk with them, maybe arrange to drop it off Wednesday night or Tuesday night or just something. The sooner you drop it off. [PERSON_NAME] could drop it off Tuesday night. Okay. And then maybe you talk with them on that, you know, because [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] don't want to speak on their behalf. [PERSON_NAME] don't know what their availability looks like, considering Mondays. You said, like, hey, I'm. I'm sorry, because you're good. You said [PERSON_NAME] can do what? Most definitely. Best recommendation that [PERSON_NAME] can. You know, my best recommendation would be just going and speaking with [ORGANIZATION] directly. So [PERSON_NAME] take it you said [PERSON_NAME] could take the car down there? Yeah, if you're available Tuesday when we open back up. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME] am. You know, speak with them, ask for either [PERSON_NAME] or [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], and then. Yes, sir. And then probably ask for. Try to ask for [PERSON_NAME]. Well, either way, whoever's at the front desk, you just want to let them know what's going on and then figure out when you can drop your vehicle off. They'll take great care of you, and then we'll get this problem resolved for you. All right. [PERSON_NAME] appreciate it. Most definitely. Well, heck, we appreciate you, and we're looking to, you know, upgrade you in [DURATION] year. So, you know, we're going to continue to always do the best of business for you. And because pretty soon you're going to be an 800 credit score, we're going to upgrade you. We're going to get you exactly what you want, and then life will be really good. All right? Yeah, most definitely. And then here. In the meantime, send me some people so [PERSON_NAME] can help you get paid. Oh, yeah, Yeah, [PERSON_NAME] am. Well, here, let's do this. No, no, let's get your car fixed first, and then you bring them to us. Because [PERSON_NAME] tell you, like, people send me other people. People send me clients [DURATION] [DURATION] long. [PERSON_NAME]. They either go to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], they go to [ORGANIZATION]. So let's get your car fixed, and then, you know, the proof is in the pudding. And then once we get everything resolved, then we're just gonna have to have you bring us some people so we could get you paid. All right? [PERSON_NAME] got you, sir. Hey, Most, [PERSON_NAME] appreciate you more. Yes, sir. So you stay safe. You have [DURATION] really awesome, wonderful weekend. And you just give me [DURATION] call if you need anything.

"Thanks for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON_NAME] speaking. How can I help you? Yeah, like talk to someone about X3 leases, are you? So you're looking at new X3s? Yeah, I've got. My [MARITAL_STATUS] gotta turn it in here like within, I think the next [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. So. Problem is I know the prices have gone through the roof, so I want to see what you've got. She's over on the mileage, so there's going to be that issue to deal with and then just see what you got on new ones, if there's any, I don't know, loaners or whatever, anything like that to get the price down. I got you. Let me do this for you. What's your name? [PERSON_NAME]. Last name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. All right, [PERSON_NAME]. And is the X3 that you guys least currently enter your name or your [MARITAL_STATUS] name? Mine. Okay. What's your cell phone number, [PERSON_NAME]? [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Gotcha. All right, [PERSON_NAME], let me put you on a brief hold and just double check my availability on X3s for you. I'll be right back. Okay, thanks. It. Thanks for all the tech. So I got plenty of availability in x3 for you guys to check out, so I know you got the least. Those due for a turn in soon? When did you want to stop by to go over your options? Either today or Saturday, but let's try and get most of this nailed out over the phone as we can. I got you. So you didn't want to come in and pick one? Well, I mean, yes, you're going to want to pick one, but you know, if this thing's going to be $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], then I'm going to have to look at something else. I got you. What's your payment goal? You know, as low as possible. The one we have right now is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I know I'm not going to get there because I see the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] things. It's like 589amonth with like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down, so. Well, the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] listing that [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down would be in addition to taxes and fees. More often than not it's closer to [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down or more so due at signing because it's not a down payment. But I get what you're coming from. We'll take a look at. What do you mean [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]? What do you mean [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]? Did you read the fine print of the promotion? No. So if you go to the promotions for any of the lease specials, you'll see that it talks about adjusted capital cost as well as taxes and fees. Any of that in addition to whatever you see. So like if it says $[MONEY_AMOUNT] due at sign in, it's not accounting for your taxes and fees. So you'd also have to put that down or sorry, due at sign in to get to the payment quoted online. And you also have to make sure the vehicle has the same msrp. Okay, so what. What are we talking about then? I mean, I don't know who would put $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down on a lease? Makes no sense. And I agree with you. You don't have to. So that's why I wanted you to come in, so we could take a look at your options and kind of try to find. I bought like 10 cars. And I bought like 10 cars from you guys. You can look me up. So, like, I mean, we just need to figure out what you got and how much it's going to cost me. If it's too much, then obviously I'll just turn the car in. But like fine print. I mean, I've been buying. I've been leasing these BMWs forever. So if the fine print changed that much, I mean, the tax, the taxes. We're [LOCATION] [LOCATION] or whatever. At 6%, right? Correct. And it's on half the value of the car, whatever the lease is. Yeah, I can I would the [OCCUPATION] and do a full breakdown for you if you want to see what all it looks like. But the. When I say the fine print, I'm talking about the lease specials. The way that leasing has been done has not been changed. I'm just saying that you will want to read carefully when you see the promotions online. Yeah, either. Which can't be another. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, either. Which way. Let's take a look at it. So here, I'll shoot you a text from my cell so you have my contact information and we'll review your options. And I know you said between today and Saturday. The only thing is, if we were to find something in a deal that you like. Keep in mind, [PERSON_NAME], I can't hold vehicles. So if you were to come in today, what time would you be able to come in? I mean, let's. Let's see if we can come to an agreement, then I can. You know, I don't live far. Like I said, I got to turn this in by this. So I've already extended and extended any longer. Understood. All right, well, I'll take a look at. So is the one that you have right now the [DATE_INTERVAL] X3? Yeah. Gotcha. Okay, let me go ahead and pull up some options, and I'll shoot you a text, okay? Sounds good, man. Appreciate it. My pleasure. [PERSON_NAME]. Talk to you soon.

Any specifics you have in mind? I just want a base model. I actually was going to buy one here in [LOCATION]. The only thing that's prompted me to call you all is that I'm getting ready to move back down to [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. You know, if I buy a car from somebody like it, like it's serviced by somebody too, so. Right. Especially a new one. And you know, I know [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION], which isn't that far from [LOCATION], to service it. I've checked with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], but I don't really like [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] much. I bought from them before and didn't feel like I got really good service from them. Gotcha. Okay, well, you know, I'm happy that you're giving us this opportunity to earn your business.

I know a lot of [OCCUPATION] just like to give you that msrp, and then when you get there, they want to slap on an extra [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'd rather know right up front what that's going to be versus getting there. But I originally quoted. Got quoted one out of [LOCATION] [LOCATION], and it was a reasonable price. It was [MONEY_AMOUNT] out the door. I don't know if you're all competitive or what it is. I've called a couple of [OCCUPATION], and they were a lot higher, and I couldn't understand why, you know, but to each their own. I just want to see if I'm better off buying it up here or coming down there and buying it. I can buy it up here and still have it serviced down there, but. And you're gonna have it registered in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] or [LOCATION]? Yeah, it'll be registered. It'll be registered. [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay.

"Thank you for calling out of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Is [PERSON_NAME] there? Who? I'm sorry. Yes, we're looking for someone named [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] in service or [OCCUPATION]? I don't know, something in [OCCUPATION]. Yeah, which is why his name is [PERSON_NAME]. He sent us a letter. [PERSON_NAME], what's his name? Oh, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. He's our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. He is here right now. He's with a client, but I have worked with him on this letter. So let me go ahead and pull up your information. Can I get your phone number? Okay, thank you. Yeah. Can I get a first and last name? It's either under my name or my [MARITAL_STATUS], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] or [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Under your name. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, and then also just to verify what is the year making model of your vehicle? That's an [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] E Tron. I think it's an E. Tron. I don't remember. Yeah, okay. Yeah. All right, so I think I got you here in the system. So how it works, Mr. [PERSON_NAME], is we would be interested in buying you out of that car. And if you're interested in looking at the options, the [DATE_INTERVAL] E Tron's also just arrived. The Q8 E Trons. So those are here. Those give you a little bit longer range, 285 miles to it. Okay, what's the. I mean, here's the idea where, you know, we. The gentleman sent us the letter. We were listening. We're willing to listen to you. Okay, what's the offer on the car? You said you had a great offer. The gentleman, or whatever his name is, [PERSON_NAME], what's. How much are you offering me for the car? He. How it works is he would have to look at the car. He would give you over sticker value or book value in the car since you have that letter and there's, you know, the confirmation code. But we still have to look at it. So I could definitely help you book an appointment. And then we are open this weekend and Monday as well. Yeah, what's. What's the. Where are you. Is it the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], Is that it? Correct. Yeah. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] on right by [DATE_INTERVAL]. Well, just give me. I'm curious what your. What your 24s are. How much is that? The MSRP? Between [MONEY_AMOUNT] and in the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So depending on the options you're looking for. Okay, but here's the idea. What's this? What's the. How much? Approximately. Approximately, because, I mean, we were, you know, we're Willing to talk to you on the phone for the moment. You know, we live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], which is. We don't want to run [DURATION] [DURATION] north for a. Just for a dog and pony show. You know what I'm saying? I mean, you know, what kind of money is this car worth right now? I mean, I can tell you it's in good shape. It's an [DATE_INTERVAL]. I'm not driving that one right now. What kind of money. What kind of miles are on that car? Listen, I forget. I think 27,000. I think somewhere around 26. 27,000. It's never been in an accident, Never had an accident. Body damage. Yeah, I mean. And truthfully, I don't want to be difficult because I don't put the numbers, I don't appraise them, and I can't say how much your car is worth without actually taking a look at it. There's things online that may help you, like the black books and blue books, that may give you an idea. You're welcome to plug in the phone, the VIN numbers and the mileage, but, yeah, I can't. Truthfully, I can't do it over the phone. Where I could give you a ballpark. It's just me guessing and telling you a number out of my head without knowing anything about the car, any little small wear and tears about the tires, the history, you know, all that stuff goes into accountability when they appraise these cars. Mm. Okay. All right. Okay. When you. And what if my car is worth xxx. Whatever it is, whatever you people say. What are you. How you're giving me a premium over the X? If X is X, how much premium are you giving me over the price? It depends. What. It depends what your payoff is. So if your payoff is [MONEY_AMOUNT] and we're able to give you [MONEY_AMOUNT] for, then you have $[MONEY_AMOUNT] of equity that you could use towards the next vehicle that you purchase. We would be buying the car off lease, is how the letter works. So you don't have to worry about the car going back to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], so you're not going to get billed any other wear and tear, if that's the case, or tires or anything like that. And then it just depends on what your payoff is, which they would pull here when you come in, what [ORGANIZATION] is asking for your car off lease, and then how much your car is worth according to the book values. And once again, any difference goes to. To you. And then in the case that for some reason you would be negative, then we would let you know and say, hey, you owe more than what the car is worth. Yeah. All right, well, I'll tell you what. If we. If I have nothing going on on the weekend, I'll run up there and let you look at the. The car. Yeah, the weekends are the best. There's less traffic on [DATE_INTERVAL], so. Yeah, you would. You know, we wouldn't waste your time. I mean, if you got that letter, it's for a reason, as part of our marketing company. So it'd be, you know, you coming in, we get with [PERSON_NAME] right away, and then he appraise your car and then give you an idea where you're at. Okay, great. All right. We'll see. All right.

And what I'll do is I'll look for those items that you mentioned and I'll let you know if I see them or I'll take pictures of them just so, you know, you feel better about having it, you know. Okay, you've got my phone number. Or maybe it doesn't show on. I'm just reading. It's kind of small on my phone. [PHONE_NUMBER] in your name. Right, Right. What my [MARITAL_STATUS] is saying. Where are you located? [LOCATION], [LOCATION] is just [LOCATION] of [LOCATION] [LOCATION], if you've ever heard about that. It's kind of like a beach community. We're near [LOCATION]. Oh, you're about [DURATION] [DURATION] away. From us. I have some family in [LOCATION], but yeah, you'll be about [DURATION] [DURATION] drive from us to the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] along the beach and the [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. That's closer than anything else I've found. Oh, that's kind of sad. All right. Well, I mean, hey, you can always. Yeah. You know, we've been looking for another [LOCATION] and we found one in [LOCATION] and one outside [LOCATION] and a bunch of them in [LOCATION]. Oh my. Yeah, that's much farther away from. From where you guys are at. Oh my gosh. Yeah, that. I would feel bad for anyone having to make that drive. I don't know about other people. I just don't like spending that much time in a car. Yeah, well, in our case it would be a truck a little bit more comfortable. But still, man, that would be a lot in gas and just a lot of time. Yeah. Make a little vacation out of it. We do pay for our customers first camping trip, up to [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So if you like got [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] stay at [LOCATION] [LOCATION] or something here at one of the campgrounds, you could always just stay. Oh, okay. You don't have to make it all in one go, you know. Well, I'm sorry. Here's the story. The story behind it is that we had a [LOCATION] and it was totaled. So that's why we're looking for another one. And one of the things that we're kind of touchy about is the running gear because the shackles and the springs on the one we had are what broke and twisted the frame. Gotcha. So, you know, I would be very curious. We would probably need to upgrade. I mean, lesson learned. We need to put Morryde suspension on it. I mean, that's something you could always do aftermarket is, you know, take it more ride and have them put on whatever you need them to put on. I know. Well, most shops can put them on. Yeah, we could probably. But what I'm sensitive about is if there is any frame damage already or shackles bent, that kind of thing. No, I wouldn't have taken it in trade. We do a pretty thorough like intake inspection when we take in trades just because we don't want to be stuck with lemons forever, you know. So we're pretty thorough about the units that we take in and we're very kind of picky. So the units on my lot should be in pretty decent shape. And this one I remember when I took it in was really nice condition. But I'll send you pictures and I'll you know, I'll take pictures of the roof, the undercarriage, all of it. You'll have everything very shortly here. And one of the things, too, I would be curious about is if there's any chipping or fading of the exterior. Okay. You know how they. If they sit in the sun a lot on the camera? Yeah. It's hard to tell on the phone. Yeah, I'll try if I see anything like that, but I'll be honest with you about it if I see anything like that. Okay. All right, well, get back to me. You've got my number. It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And like I said, you're a lot closer than anybody else. Well, I'll get back to you within the next [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], if that's okay. That's fine. I'm going to get out here and do some [DRUG] eating because it's cool. And later, it won't be definitely good to do that before [TIME], that's for sure. Okay. Well, thank you. And your name was? My name's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay.

"Good afternoon, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME], and I'm just wondering if you guys have any hybrid RAV4s in the color lunar rock on your lot or in your allocations that have not yet been claimed. Are you looking for new or used, [PERSON_NAME]? Honestly, open to either. I prefer new because for some strange reason, the market is supporting buying a used car for the price of a new one. And that doesn't sit right with me, but I'm open. Okay, let's see here. Let me look at my new first. Okay. Not one single lunar rock grab four in about 30 of them. Sounds about right. You're like, I'm used to it. Let's see what they got for you. I haven't seen a lunar rock in a long time. Oh, until now. We have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Hybrid XLA Premium Certified 1 owner, 40,000 miles for [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, no, thanks. I know. I mean, you can order one if you're not in a hurry, you know, we can get one. Yeah, I've been told that that's about [DURATION] [DURATION] wait, though. The closest I've been told. I actually just got off the phone with [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION], and they let me know that they're about a [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] wait because I don't want anything fancy. I just want a hybrid in the color lunar rock. I don't need any fancy packages or anything like that. I'm good with XLE or whatever, but so they said, like, that could get it a little faster. But I'm calling from [LOCATION] where the wait is over [DURATION] [DURATION]. Like, that's ridiculous. So. Wow. No, a RAV4 is not [DURATION] [DURATION] wait here. A Sienna is [DURATION] [DURATION] wait. But we can get RAVs. Okay, so what does that process look like for you guys? Like, if I was to say, okay, I want practically a base model, Almost. [ORGANIZATION] Hybrid RAV4 in the color lunar rock. What would your guys timeline be for that, do you think? I mean, the only hard part of that is the color, but I don't even know if it would take us [DURATION] [DURATION] if you're open to models. I mean, like, even a le. Yeah, like, all I wanted. All I really care about is that it's a lunar rock. Like that color. It's a hybrid. Heated seats would be nice, and I'm gonna put a tow package on it. And so, like, that's all I care about. I don't need a fancy giant iPad screen or special surround sound Yeah, I wonder if [LOCATION] just has like a long wait list or something because they just. There's no way it would take [DURATION] [DURATION]. I think we have a long wait list, but also we just. I think the dealerships don't sell enough cars to have a like a weighted stay in the cars that they request. So I just don't think a lot of people in [LOCATION] are really buy fancy new cars. That's more of like a. I don't know, I guess maybe in [LOCATION] people do a little more. I think [LOCATION] a little fancier than [LOCATION]. It's like a little step up maybe when it comes to generalizing the people because I don't know, we just care about potatoes here, you know. Well, I mean, I just can't maybe I'm along the lines with [LOCATION]. I mean, could be [DURATION] [DURATION], but I'm kind of thinking like [DURATION]. It's hard to really give you like a hard answer, but [DURATION] to 8 really comfortable to me. And you'd have to get an XLE to get the lunar rock. So really what we do, our process here is you just build what you want on [URL] youm can send it to me, you can email or text or whatever's easiest. We take, we get your physical address because we send that into [ORGANIZATION] Just showing like who we're selling to in the market to make sure you're not like an [OCCUPATION]. And then we take a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit. Our pricing is MSRP plus [MONEY_AMOUNT] and what that includes is a [MONEY_AMOUNT] documentation fee. And then we put two accessories on our vehicles. One is called pull and it's a rear end collision avoidance system. So we wire it into every third brake light. So when you put your foot on the brake, it pulses four times and then turns solid just warning the driver behind you. And then we put an exterior interior protection on the vehicle to keep it looking brand new for [DURATION] [DURATION]. Or they repaint, reupholster or replace at no cost and no limit to claims. You compile. That's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. Our customers all love it. That's awesome. And it's how much? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yep. MSRP plus [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Perfect. Okay. We love hearing that people are selling for MSRP too. That makes me so happy. The other, the [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] was like, yeah, we don't charge like they also charge like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] but for like [OCCUPATION] fees and stuff, like additional. So I got off the phone with someone. I was talking to someone in [LOCATION]. I've been calling her out and she's like, yeah, we charge an additional like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] to MSRP. And I was like, wait, what the, what the. Why that's ridiculous. Yeah, it really was. And she's like, especially because you're out of state. State. And I'm like, if I was a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and someone was traveling across the country to get a car from me, I would give them a discount because they're paying for all that travel and all that stuff. I'd be like, you know what, here you go, here's $[MONEY_AMOUNT] off. But that girl was also kind of a witch. She was really mean and she's like, okay, bye. And I was like, yeah, there are some [OCCUPATION] just kind of like, I know [PERSON_NAME] charges [MONEY_AMOUNT] over and they just say it's a market adjustment. They'll just tell you straight up, we're just making money while we can. No, for sure, for sure. Okay. And then I have a question about your guys deposit. Is it refundable or non refundable? Because the dealership in [LOCATION], theirs is refundable, but the dealership here in [LOCATION], there's our non refundable, which I think is silly. And so what's your guys take on that? It's kind of case by case. If your car is not built yet and you find one somewhere else, it is refundable. If your car gets here and you decide you don't want it anymore, it is not refundable. Okay, like if you decide I don't really like that color now. No, we would not refund it because it's a lot of work to place the orders, try to get cars because they don't just like place an order, hit send, you know, add to cart and then just wait. Yeah, they work with the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and they literally work and work and work and work to try to find this car anywhere to do [OCCUPATION] trades, you know, just to try to speed up the process so [ORGANIZATION] doesn't have to stop production and build a special order. They will literally try to get it anywhere they can. And if they can't, obviously they're going to keep producing and then you know, try to get it that way. But it's a lot of work to place an order and get the vehicles. So. But again we also get that sometimes people have called everywhere and a [OCCUPATION] might come up with one for them. And if we don't have anything for you like built and on the way reserved, we'll refund your money. We're pretty understanding of that. That is so good to know. Wow. I love [LOCATION]. Okay, well, it's kind of a general answer, but you kind of understand, you know, like, it's case by case, but we're pretty understanding of situations and things. You know, life changes and whatever, so. Yes, I get that. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Sorry, I've just been, like, taking notes while you're talking. Oh, that's okay. Do you want me to take your contact information and send you mine just in case you decide to move forward? Yeah, I would love that. I can give you my email and then we could stay in contact that way. Okay, I am ready. Okay, so it's [PERSON_NAME], but with one [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And I'll send you an email right now just so you have my contact information. And then just let me know if you have any questions. Okay. Thank you so much for your time. And what was your name? One more time. [PERSON_NAME]. It's [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, perfect. Awesome. Well, sweet. Thank you for sending me that email. And then I am going to talk to my [MARITAL_STATUS], and if we decide to make a deposit, I will let you know. Okay, that sounds good. Awesome.

I'm pretty like it depends if I go with [LOCATION] or [LOCATION], but I'm kind of. I don't need a Denali, but like an AT4 would be nice or the Z71 or even the package lower on either side, just depending what options it has. Yeah, absolutely. Let me take a peek. What are some of the options that you're wanting? I can click them off and cross. I'm not like that. I just like heated seats, honestly, and like remote start, but I think they all have that. So other than that I just like. It needs like backup camera, backup sensors, all that kind of stuff. But they're all pretty standard with that stuff now. Yeah, for the most part. Yeah. I'm pretty set on white. I don't know if you guys have any white ones coming in. Okay. I know I have a white trail boss coming in. Okay, and when's that arriving? Ish. I. I live up in [LOCATION] and I've just been talking to [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], but I've bought a couple trucks off them before and I'm not a huge fan of [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], so. Okay.

What's the price on that day [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, that's not too bad. Yeah, so it's sort of kitted out with some of those more like more options that you're after. So I'm just looking at the build right now. Yes. And that one, the Trail boss, it comes with like the [PHONE_NUMBER] inch lifts and the slightly wider stance and whatnot. Just to be more of a. Yeah, like off road style truck, remote keyless entry unlocking disks. I've been looking at a lot of the build specs on them and a lot of them don't list the heated seats option. Like heated seats, heated steering wheel. So I don't know if it's a standard option or if it's. I have to double check. I know it comes in like sometimes they just have like specific packages. It's like package has xyz. Yeah. Because this one I'm not seeing heated seats either. So I'm like. I'm like, what the heck. I have a couple other steps I can do. I'd still be like, heated seats is not going to make me not buy a truck. But do you have any idea when it's incoming? Because I haven't actually physically looked at one yet. Being in [LOCATION], I know it's going to be a little vague and my apologies for that, but we've had just like getting from [LOCATION] to here has been taking a little bit. Could be here any day. Okay, perfect. Yeah, that's where we're at with that one from looking into that. [LOCATION] doesn't have the heated seats for whatever reason. But I'll dig a little deeper into it. What was your name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Perfect [PERSON_NAME]. I'll look at, see what we got for canyons coming as well. I got you here on the line. Yeah, I prefer the canyon, but I'm just kind of set on. On white. Yeah. I've got a trade that I'd be trading in and when I went to [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] just last week there, what they were offering was not all that good. So what's your trade, if you don't mind me asking? [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION], 1500, the classic. But it's got like a [ORGANIZATION] lift in it with 35s and it's super, super clever. [ORGANIZATION] lifts with 35s, eh? Yeah. It's only got 23k on it. He's looking to downsize a bit. Yeah, I kind of upsized and then the girlfriend bought like a new nice suv and we honestly drive that more. So I just need a smaller. Gotcha. Huh. Looks like we got a white canyon as well. It's just in the middle of production. Yeah, I'm in no like super rush. I just want to see like what's incoming and price wise there. Yeah, yeah. I think I keep seeing at 4s all over. Like I see them priced at [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then I also like, I called [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and they had one priced at [MONEY_AMOUNT], which was crazy. Yeah, there's [MONEY_AMOUNT] as well, which is like the super off road package. Anywhere from like as low as to like kind of like a [MONEY_AMOUNT] range all the way up to like [MONEY_AMOUNT] if you really want to start pushing them. Okay, yeah. Do you have like a budget mind? Assume you're looking at financing or like Obviously the like [MONEY_AMOUNT] or under would be like [MONEY_AMOUNT] is perfect. But yeah, depends what it's got. And I don't owe anything on my truck, so I would just be financing smaller. Yep, perfect. And then did you have an email? [PERSON_NAME], I'm going to send you some build sheets and then I think the best avenue would be when we get that trail boss in, I give you a ring and you come and sit in it, drive it and feel it and that way you actually have something to go for instead of just a bunch of pieces of paper that don't really have too much value. But it looks like this at 4 that's coming in, seems like a really well equipped truck, but nonetheless. What was your email there? [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Perfect. And then I assume this is your cell phone number here? Yep. Perfect. The best way to get hold of me is just text me. Okay, gotcha. And then what I'll do is I'll shoot you off those couple builds and then when we get that, [LOCATION] should like hopefully here sooner than later, but nonetheless when it gets here, I'll shoot you a text, be like, hey, come on, let's go take her for a drive and see how it fits and if it works with you and sort of go from there. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. Oh, they lose you. Can you hear me? Yeah, my phone's been on the fridge. Sorry. Oh, that's okay. Anyway, yeah, thank you so much but yeah, just give me a text when they're coming in. Cool. Sounds good, buddy. Okay, thanks. Have a good day. You too.

Either way, sir. Okay. Any, any 911s or GTS that's coming in from your. That's allotted for you guys. Let's see, nothing for the gts. The GTS is two customs that are coming in from other previous. Looks like three customs coming in from other previous orders. And then there's four of you in line. And then when it comes to the S alone. Let's see, when it comes to the S, there's one person on a [OCCUPATION] order, four people in line. Oh really? Wow. Okay. Yeah, that's really like high commodity. You know that the 911. Right. That's the thing too about the brand itself because yeah, everyone after understanding that these take a while to be made. Like for instance, the, the GT3Rs. I'll give you an example of. There is 10 people. There's 10 people in line waiting. So again it's, it's. The brand is definitely just a matter of time dictate. Yeah. The opportunity. Yeah. As time passes, the opportunity presents itself and that's why we're here to help Provide you guys that peace of mind and still keep you informed. Because ideally, yeah, it's like. It's. It's almost like waiting for [EVENT] all over again, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why I was, you know, I mean, I'm not gonna go jump to different [OCCUPATION], but I just want to stick with you guys. That's what I was, you know, that's why I keep. I mean, not keep, but this is the first time I called you guys to see, you know, which number am I in the list? So. Yeah, greatly appreciate that part and rest assured too, there's still never. Never wishing for someone else's shortcomings. But there's still always chances for you to still bump up in line depending on if someone skips their slot opportunity. I will. Or if in case someone may so happen to back out. Who knows? It does happen. Yeah, yeah, but correct. Yes, definitely there. There's hope that you will see one sooner than later, but. Right. Yeah, but definitely we give you that call as soon as we end up seeing your opportunity presenting itself. Did they pick up the GPS red car? Oh, yes, of course. Right away. Yeah, shortly after. Okay. It's not quite. Yes. Not common for a lot of people to not come get their custom. That they've been waiting for, you know. Yeah, yeah, it's a while. It's been a while. I mean, it's a long period of time to wait and, you know, it's really sad if you don't pick it up, if you don't have the car yet, you know, or something went wrong. But yeah, yeah, so I'll keep touching. So I would try to. I'm pretty sure you guys would normally call your customers and let them know that if they're ready for their. For choosing their cars that, you know, that they wanted, you guys normally could call them. Right. One more time, sir. You guys normally would call the customers that you. Nice. For the, you know, for the wait if. Just in case they, you know, there's availability for a customer. Yeah. Like for instance, if there's ever as soon as a slot presents itself. Yes. We call accordingly to call them. Yeah, we do respect everyone's. Like for instance, the first person in line, they have the choice. They know they left an allocation. And if an allocation appears and that first person in line goes, you know what? It's right now, I know I left the order, but life happened. So not the right time. Please push me back in line. Then number two will show up and say, oh, sure, I'll take it and so forth, you know, so definitely, when opportunities represent themselves, even in different ways, we always try to let you guys know because ideally, that this is. That is what it's about as well. It's the opportunity and the chances for it. While we know everyone, like yourself, is being patient alongside us. So it's always appreciated, and that's why it's more than transparently communicated. Whenever you guys give us a call or we call to update you guys, because we know it's a time sensitive. Right. So. Yeah, the best way we can. Okay. Thanks, [PERSON_NAME], for letting me know that you guys would call and, you know, hopefully I could get the card from you guys. Of course, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. Thank you so much. Okay. Yeah. It'll just be a matter of when and definitely we'll make it happen. And it will happen. It's not. All right, great. Not exactly. Yeah.

"Thanks for calling your name at [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Yes, good morning. I got a quick question on your electric vehicles. Do you all qualify for the federal tax refund or rebate? Yes, it all depends on the vehicle, but yes, we do have vehicles that qualify for the tax credit and we do have some that are built in at the time of purchase as well. Were you looking at a specific episode? Was looking at the i4. Okay. Yeah. So, yes, there is a rebate on the i4. But let me ask you this. Besides the [ORGANIZATION] i4, are there any other makes and models you're looking at? No. All right, perfect. Well, you picked a great time to call. And the reason why I say that is because we have been selling so many new i4s with the incentives that we've been getting in a lot of them. Now, let me ask this. Who am I speaking with? What's her name? [PERSON_NAME]. And last name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. All right, [PERSON_NAME], give me one second. I'm going to double check the availability on these i4s. What's a good cell phone number for you? The one I'm calling on. It should be on your caller id. Yes, sir. All right, give me one sec while I double check the availability. Okay. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is open Monday through Friday, [TIME] to [TIME] Saturday, [TIME] to [TIME] and open [TIME] to [TIME] on only the last Sunday of the month. Our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is open Monday through Friday, [TIME] to [TIME] Saturday, [TIME] to [TIME] and closed on Sundays. We encourage you to check our website, [URL] for the latest updates on hours of operations and dealership news. Thank you so much for your patience and a team member will be with you shortly. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. All right. Hello? Yeah. All right. So great news. I do show availability on that i4, [PERSON_NAME]. But let me ask, what are you driving at the moment? It's just a new purchase. Okay, so no trade in? No. Okay. So, yeah, I do show availability. I have several different options. It's [TIME] now. When's a good time for you to come in for your test drive? Not necessarily coming to test drive right now. I'm just trying to see if it's going to be among the ones that we're looking at. So if it does qualify for the rebate, how much rebate does it qualify for? It depends on which one you go with. Some have rebate and the and Some have a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] rebate. Which ones have the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] rebate? That's the I for the 30. I4 30. I see. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is that not a thing, right? Yeah, that's. That's a different one. That's a different model. [PERSON_NAME], do you have a pen and paper available? Yeah, I'm trying to see the. In. Your website is not showing me that as an option. Somehow says [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [MONEY_AMOUNT], 30, you saying correct. Give me one sec while I look with you. Okay, you're on. You're on the website now. Yeah, I'm looking. So new model. What. What model is it? It has model series 2, 3, [LOCATION], 5, whatever rebate. You're specifically. Look, that $[MONEY_AMOUNT] rebate, you're specifically looking for the i4 i35. I'm sorry I messed up the 30, but it's the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, but it doesn't come up on your list. Okay, I saw it right here. Okay, I see it now. Okay. What's the difference between the [MONEY_AMOUNT] and the [MONEY_AMOUNT]? A little bit of horsepower. So what's the range? Try to see the range. The range on the [MONEY_AMOUNT], I think it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And the [MONEY_AMOUNT] is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right, so there's a difference in price here. So the 53, the i35, is the one that has the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] rebate. Okay. And the [MONEY_AMOUNT] only has [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right. I'd have to. I'd have to look into that one. Let me do this. [PERSON_NAME], do you have a pen and paper available? Yeah. Write this down for me. Going to give you my cell phone number. Okay. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And my direct cell phone. And what I'm going to do, I'm going to look into all of the available rebates for you with [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. And it has to be the i4. I'm looking for the. Not the most expensive EV that you have. We're looking at the iD4 overlay, and we're looking at the Kias and the Ionics. I guess that's been died so far. All right, well, I'm going to look into all of the rebates and programs on the i4 and I'll give you a call back. Okay, so the i4, they have the [MONEY_AMOUNT] and the [MONEY_AMOUNT] is what you're saying, right? Correct. Okay, yeah. All right. That'd be Great. If, if you don't mind, we, we are gonna try to pull the trigger soon. Now on the financing, we gonna, I'm gonna get my, my, my money all approved and all that. So I'll be writing a check for it unless you all have a better financing than we do. So. I don't know what type of financing you have. Do you know what rate I should be in the lower end or whatever they have. My credit score is over 800. So whatever you have, that's your best rate. That's, that's probably what I want to qualify for. But I mean if you're all in the [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I mean, I seen, I couldn't tell you which one I saw. I think it was a [ORGANIZATION] anyway. Yeah, they had so [MONEY_AMOUNT], I think on a [DURATION] [DURATION] or something like that. One of the [OCCUPATION], I guess. So I don't know what you'll have. That's all it's asking. All right, so once we lock on the car, man, good news is it sounds like you have financing secured through your, through your bank as a backup. Worst case scenario, as soon as we lock in on a car, we can get into all of that. Okay. It's gonna be like I said, the [ORGANIZATION] i4. We already tested out the, the ID4 [ORGANIZATION] and we tried to get something that would be equivalent. And I was just, this is for my [MARITAL_STATUS], it's not for me. So I just, I was looking at this this morning because we didn't even consider it. I was like, I think [ORGANIZATION] has one. So that's how we're looking at it. And it says starting at [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And I, I don't know what the difference for that whole big range is. Right. So. And it says up to three [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles. But it didn't tell me which one. This 01 mile. So. Gotcha. That's what I was trying to look at. But so here you told me though, it's gonna have to be the, for the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], it's gonna be the, the E335. So what I'm looking for, I guess it's going to be two options, either the E35 or the E40, which. The E40 gives me the full range, is what you said, right? Correct range, yeah. The [MONEY_AMOUNT] is going to give you [MONEY_AMOUNT] range. Now let me ask, are you, are you local? Where are you located? Okay, you're in [LOCATION]. That's good. Okay. We've been by your [OCCUPATION], not stopped but we drive by it every so often. But anyway, what I, you got my cell phone number so if you don't mind the color we can't go with white black interior. So when you, when you study the, if you can text me the, the information with the VIN number because I'll email it to my [MARITAL_STATUS] to look at it. The, the VIN numbers of the, the ones that you have and, and the, the rebates and the drive out price. I want to see just the, the drive out price. All of these. Most of the time they, they drive. We're ready to go. We just. That's why when you say when are you coming to the [OCCUPATION]? That's somewhat there point being send me your best price because what I'm telling you is this. If yesterday we already saw the [ORGANIZATION] Type and so we got it, we already test drove it, whatever and they already gave me a, a, A price. But basically not the negotiat practice. We just test right to see if it's on the running for what we want. So that one is on the deck. Now the [ORGANIZATION]. I look I'm all good with it. So if, if the price, if this, if your [ORGANIZATION] price out of my range don't, don't even need to go to test drive it. So if it's within what I'm. What's the budget? Yeah, depends on the type of car because we're also looking at the [ORGANIZATION]. So it just depends. But right now to be competitive, let's say if you want to be at the same price range as the ID4. They were at [MONEY_AMOUNT] just right there. It's plus or minus [MONEY_AMOUNT] something. It just depends how we end up negotiating. I think they were [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] or something. Preliminary discussion basically almost MSRP they drive out but the discounts and whatever and that's the ID Pro s Whatever. Okay, well let me get to work on this. I have a nice project on my hands. I'll see what I can put together for us. And I'm looking forward to earning your business. Yes, just let me know on the, on the rebates because that's going to drive the price, right? The MSRP minus that rebate. Even if it looks like we're going to have to pay the cash out and wait until next year to get that rebate. But still, as long as I probably get it then it's not too bad. No. Well [ORGANIZATION] we sold. How is that. Can you explain that to me? Well [ORGANIZATION] advances the rebate so you'll see it on the front End. So whatever the MSRP is, it'll be. Yeah. So you don't have. Oh, okay. Because it's not assembled in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] and all that stuff. So you're doing the same thing. Just you're giving everybody the credit up front and call it a done deal. Yep. Right. You got it. Now it makes sense. Oh, okay. Then, then, then it's just a matter of the drive off price there. No, I appreciate you being forward with that because a lot of people are not being forward with that. They're like, oh, yeah, whatever, you have to lease it. Let me ask you, are you looking for a specific color combination or you pretty open? It's all about the deal. It's all about the numbers. Okay. No, I'm open to any color. My [MARITAL_STATUS] is the one that's going to pick the colors like I told you, but white and black and we always agree on. But she'll pick. She'll pick the color. That's what I'm telling you. White. And she doesn't even know I'm talking to you now because we didn't even think about the [ORGANIZATION], so. But I think it's a good car. So if. So just look at the. If you don't have to deal with a rebate, just look at the E4 because she'll be. She. The higher range is what she's looking for. Also, you know the, the mileage on the range. So disregard the [MONEY_AMOUNT] and just work on the best deal you can get me on an i440. That's the one that has the higher range, right? Correct. Okay, perfect. They have. Like I said, it should be a cash purchase and that's pretty much it. All right, sounds good. Let me get to work on this. Okay, thank you. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. Just a heads up what I may do, I may get with my new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and work on this together so he may give you a call with me, okay? Oh, not a problem. All right, man. Just wanted to give you. All right, man.",success,feature_question,i4,medium,False,02a859f71d6d43ca9104e123367b6e02_transcript.json

All right, good deal. You playing on a computer screen? Yeah. What. What is the exact. I need the windows sticker or something. Here we [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay, so the way it works on the [ORGANIZATION], most of our cars have a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] package on them. They negotiate that down to [MONEY_AMOUNT] as opposed to [MONEY_AMOUNT], and then you get $[MONEY_AMOUNT] under MSRP. So on this car, your price ends up being a net price of [MONEY_AMOUNT], including tax and license and everything to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right. You are way over anybody else. You know that, right? What is everybody else giving you? Basically, it is incredibly easy to get a [ORGANIZATION] for $[MONEY_AMOUNT] on their sticker. Okay. Incredibly. All right. On something that's on my lot, it's very easy. I mean, it's usually the cars that are incoming that people are putting deposits on that are kind of hard. I mean, I'm [MONEY_AMOUNT] under stick. What do you got? My accessory package. It is last day of month. Here. Let me see here. Hang on. Last day of the month. What's sitting out there that you want to dump?

If I give you [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the car in case it needs anything, it leaves me a little bit of room. So I'd be player at [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it. Could you do [MONEY_AMOUNT]?

You and I spoke about [DURATION] [DURATION] ago about my daughter buying a [ORGANIZATION] CRV from your dealership. Yes, sir. And the license plate. So, you know, I guess this is kind of the purchasing process that's going to keep on giving. [PERSON_NAME] sent an email to my daughter, and it literally says, just, good day. You should have received a package to [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION]. Doesn't explain what it is or anything. The package was sent to my [MARITAL_STATUS], not my daughter. And it's not sent by [ORGANIZATION]. I'm not gonna get into the semantics. There's a modification to the document. Not explaining why the document was modified, the lack of respect. Like. Like pick up the phone, explain what's different, why we have to sign something a third time. Yep. Like, I had a point. Now we're not going to sign it because nobody explains to what it is. I don't like being told just, you should have received a package to [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION]. It's a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Right. Like it's. It's terrible. I'm not going to disagree with you at all. Financial to try to start the loan payment. It doesn't identify our loan happens now with the credit and it's going to get all screwed up. Would have no choice but to take an action. Right. Against [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. And there's. And there's nothing that's going to happen there. I will. I will. Nothing will happen. I've never had to find loan documents three times to purchase a car. And I'm not going to tell you something I don't know. I wasn't obviously expecting this call. Right. So I'd rather check. And I hear your frustration. I understand your frustration and I agree with your frustration. So I'd rather have all my facts put together before I start saying stuff and telling you what those documents are, right? What you're signing, why you're signing them, versus just you Know, trying to guess on what it is. So do you mind. Go ahead, if you want to. Go ahead and. But then, like, it looked like what she did is like, I think. And I don't have the document right for me, but it was like, where there's a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] rebate from [ORGANIZATION], and it probably says paid by ahm. I think she's crossed out something and she wrote ahm in place of it. Yeah. It's gonna say paid by. Hm. Yeah. So once again, I'm pretty sure I know what it is. But let me. I'm the type of person that wants to, you know, be factual and not just right. You know, let me find out what's going on with this. And I apologize, [PERSON_NAME]. This has been frustration on your end since day one. So let me see if I can help. Guy. [PERSON_NAME], right? I mean, [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, no. [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. Like, he's waste. I mean, he's there to sell cars, not hear from a customer that bought a car [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Yeah, yeah. You guys want to be selling more cars, not dealing with us. And we just want to move on and pay for the car and, you know, enjoy the car and be happily ever after, Right? Yeah, absolutely. So if you could find out what the deal is and then what do we need to do not do. Is this really. The third time is going to be the final time we have. And somebody's got to train [PERSON_NAME], like, have some customer, like, respect for a customer. Pick up the phone and explain it. Say what you want. People don't just. I mean, these are legal documents. What are we signing and not signing? And I'm not overly dramatic. Right. Because we. Before, we just signed whatever. Right. But at the third time. No, we're not just going to sign it the third time with a note that just says, you should have received a package to [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION]. Yep. You can't keep doing that. Yep. 100% agree with you, sir. Like a documentation fee. Right. We paid $[MONEY_AMOUNT] the first time. Not be big enough. Maybe. Maybe we're just maximizing all the documents, that's all. We wanted to get all [MONEY_AMOUNT] out of that, make sure we get our money's worth. Exactly. Screw it. Look into it. I'd appreciate it. I will take a look. At least I got a little laugh out of you.

I'm sorry, it is taxes in [LOCATION] is 6.9%. So if I bought it at your place, it would be a little less than it is if I bought it in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Is that correct? It's pretty much similar. We have to get in contact with one of the parents [OCCUPATION] to register the car based in the old [ORGANIZATION] area, you know. Did you buy the car here at [LOCATION]? [EMAIL_ADDRESS], I did not. All right, so to my personal state, it's pretty much the same employee. But to get the exact amount of the registration of the car, which is going to be including the taxes of the purchase of the residual value, we have to get in contact with the finance money and he got to submit all that info, you know, based on the typical area. Okay, what is Your [OCCUPATION] fee? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But when you least buy out the car, you will be charged with [OCCUPATION] fee. The only thing you pay is the government fee, which is the plate and you, you know, a plate and taxes, which is the 7%. Okay, wait, I'm not real clear on that. You're saying there would be no [OCCUPATION] fee? It's not [OCCUPATION] fee. When you at least buy out your car, at least we us, we break them. Okay, yeah. So pretty much what you're gonna pay is the receivable body of your car and the government fee. Now what type of car you have? Sonata [DATE_INTERVAL]. [DATE_INTERVAL]. [DATE_INTERVAL]. And why are you taking that decision to lease buy out your car? How much is the receiver value of your car? I like the car. That's why you like the car. What's up? Very low mileage. You know, you can get money up equity if you trading your car and you got tax savings and you can get a brand new low, you know, a brand new car and get the best monthly payment you can get now and Date. Yeah, I pretty much decided to purchase it because it's got everything I want. So now how much is tag, registration and title? That's with the fantasy money. I got the I gotta get you a quote based on your [ORGANIZATION] area and he's not there. Yeah, we can do it, but you will have to bring the car because then we got to do inspection on the car because it's like you buying a pre owned car, you know, you buy a used car again, you know, can you give me a ballpark figure and how much tag and title and registration would be? See how I can do this? I don't know if it counts that I've already got. You know, I register it every year or I have a tag. Yeah, you got a tag, but it's under the lease now you want to finance in the car or maybe you want to own the car if you pay cash, you know, and then you got to report that to the state, you know. Yeah, some idea. So what we can do is I'm gonna send you a tax. Do you get tax messy at this number? Say that again. Do you receive tax messy at this number that you just provided me? [EMAIL_ADDRESS], not tax. [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. May I have your email? [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Got it. So let me repeat it one more time. Yes, got it. All right, so I'm gonna send you an email right now. Can you please reply with the picture of the VIN number of the car and picture of your. Of the mileage of your car and that way I can clear a quote and send it to you by email. All right. Okay, good. All right, talk to you soon. Let me do that right now. Okay, bye. Bye.

"Thanks so much for choosing [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. If you could answer [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] questions for me. The battery on my key fob is probably going because it's working sometimes and not. You replace that, right? Yes, of course. Okay. Is there a charge? I probably need service as well. So for the battery, you can just stop by the parts and they'll be able to do it for you. I think the battery is about like $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh, okay. Yeah. Would you be able to check to see what my service like, where I stand, if I need another service? Sure. Is this for your [DATE_INTERVAL] or your [DATE_INTERVAL]? [DATE_INTERVAL]. How did you know by my phone number? Yes, ma' am. Okay, hold on one second. Okay, sure. Okay. So for the [DATE_INTERVAL], the last time you came in for service was back in [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. We registered the vehicle at about 6,000 miles, if I'm looking at this correctly. Yeah, no, it was probably in [DATE_INTERVAL]. Oh, I thought it was [DATE_INTERVAL]. I had it there. No. Yeah, you came in [DATE_INTERVAL] in [DATE_INTERVAL]. Oh. Because I looked in my file and I only found a bill for [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay. I probably misfiled it. Yeah. My mileage now is about 6,000 something. I'm not in the near the car to check. I don't drive it much, especially since [MEDICAL_CONDITION] started. I'm driving it less. Right. So that's probably what it is right now. You're not due for service. It would be every year or 10,000 miles. So since you don't drive the vehicle so often, we'll probably won't see you until [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] this year. So I had it. Oh, oh. And I had. You're telling me. I. I don't know where that bill is. Yeah, I had it. What was my mileage in [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. What I'm seeing here is 6100. I don't know. That doesn't sound. It doesn't sound too right. No, I'd have to go out to the car right now, but I'm not doing that. Okay, so I had it. What service did I have in [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]? You did a service. B. B. I thought I did that in [DATE_INTERVAL]. I don't know. Something's wrong. Yeah. You came in and do your [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] inspection. You had a coupon. Does this not sound right? I had a coupon. Where would I get a Coupon? This is Ms. [PERSON_NAME], correct last name? Yes. Yes. First name? [PERSON_NAME]. Well, that's my [MARITAL_STATUS]. I'm [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, okay. Hi, Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. Let's see? Yeah. You still currently living at [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? Yes, that's me. Yeah, I'm looking at. Okay, so you're saying I had 6,100 in [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL], and that. That was a service B. What service did I have in [DATE_INTERVAL]? Let's see. Back in [DATE_INTERVAL]? [DATE_INTERVAL], you did a service A. So I have this car since [DATE_INTERVAL]. How's that possible? I'm not sure. I got it in [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL], I believe. Okay, yeah, I see that. But as far as service goes, [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], you were here for service B. Then [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. On [EVENT] [EVENT] [DATE_INTERVAL], you came in first. Service A. And what about [PERSON_NAME]? Prior to that, we have you down. You had a front tire issue. I think that was a little fender bender thing. And then prior before that, you did a service B back in [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. So there's two service Bs. So we do service A, B, A, B. We alternate it every 10,000 miles or [DURATION] [DURATION]. It's whichever your vehicle's due for. So there's no service C. We would do a service seat, but it all depends on what the vehicle's due for. Okay, so what am I due for now? I'm due for what? Oh, I'm not due until [DATE_INTERVAL], you said. Right, yeah, you're not due until [DATE_INTERVAL]. You're not due and for [DATE_INTERVAL] and that you'll do a service A. Oh, so it goes abab. Yeah, ABAB is not like abc kind of like. I thought there was the C. Okay. Okay. So then I just basically needed a. Now the key. Do you know anything about that? The. The. The key. It's sporadic. That it's not work. Like yesterday, I had to take that little thing off. The way you start the car, that silver button. Yeah, your blade. And stick my key in. And then at one point, I was not able to lock the car. And then [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] later, from my window, it was on my driveway, I was able to lock the car. So I don't understand that that means the battery is weak. It may be. So I would try changing the battery and seeing if anything, you know, changes from there. If you're still experiencing the same issue, we would have to definitely bring the vehicle back in. Oh, it may not be the battery on the. On the key. It could be something else. It could be. We just don't know. I would try the battery and see if that works. Okay. Because my [MARITAL_STATUS], on his key now, he very rarely uses my car, so I would Imagine the battery goes from usage or from time. It could be both. You know, if you use your. Your key so very often. Well, I do, but he doesn't. I mean, he doesn't because he doesn't drive my car very. So his battery, his key is not working either. Okay. Yeah, it could be from time as well. You know, it's just like a remote control. After a certain amount of time, the battery is going to wear out. So it's basically the same thing. After a certain amount of time, you would have to, you know, change the battery frequently out. If you use it so often, even if it's just sitting for a while, it would still need to be replaced as well. So if it's not the battery and I can't unlock the car, sometimes I can, sometimes I cannot. Could it be something else? It could be, but like. Like I said I would, I would. I wouldn't know that. I would definitely first try and get that battery in your remote changed first and then take it from there. Okay. I don't do that. All right, so I'm not. I thought I was due for a service so I can go locally to a hardware store and get that same battery instead of coming all the way down. Of course, of course. Okay. And if I put in a new battery and everything's fine. And everything's fine. If it's not, then it's something else. Yeah, Just give me a call back. I'll send you my direct line and you can give me a call back whenever. Okay, you'll. You'll send me your direct. What, you're going to send me a text? Yeah, I'll send you a text message and you just.

Okay, only Maverick. Only Maverick. Only Maverick. Okay. Is the reason why. Yeah, this is what I want. Like. No. Yeah, like. Like are you using something special like personal vehicle? Yeah, just. Just a specialized vehicle that I need to use it for. So let me ask you, how long you been there, like with that dealership? [DURATION] [DURATION]. Good. Hey, question. So if I order from you guys directly and will you guys charge me extra over on the msrp? No, we don't do any markups on orders, sir. The reason why is because the only reason why we charge markups is for vehicles that become available that are canceled orders. Like if I get a Maverick right now, that customer doesn't pick up, we'll put a premium because it's hard for us to replace it. And it's pretty much the reason why they ordered, you know, you pretty much, you know, you're ordering it to wait for, you know, to get the vehicle.

"Thank you for calling out of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON_NAME] speaking. Could help you. Hey, can I speak with [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], please? Again, I'm the last person here in the building. We closed it at [TIME]. Oh, okay. I got a letter saying that I guess it was from you guys over there saying that that maybe I would be able to keep my same car payments and that you would be able to take in my current leased vehicle and get an [ORGANIZATION] for the same price. In many cases it's been the case. Obviously, we typically just go by the letter. I mean, again, those are all based on some estimations based on what we think your payoff is with average miles. There are some things that we don't know, but we've done about a 28% conversion ratio with those letters. So we're doing one out of four. We're doing pretty well. Okay. I have an [ORGANIZATION] MDX. Okay. Most folks are in great shape in the [ORGANIZATION] from what I've seen. We've seen a lot of the RDXs and the MDXs recently. Yeah. Are you in a lease or do you own it or what is your. What is your. I'm in a lease. The lease is up, I believe. I have to look at the lease. I haven't looked at it in a while, but I believe it's up in [DATE_INTERVAL]. So I'm looking. We're able to buy those, which is again, one of the reasons we've been reaching out. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm looking right now for a car. You know, we weren't really looking at Audis, but since I got the letter, it piqued my interest. So that was something I was looking at a little bit. Not that much. You know, I am looking for something with a third row. That's why I have the MDX is the [DATE_INTERVAL]. Does that have the third row? It is not. Our three row vehicle is going to be our [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. Okay. And is that going to be something that's going to be much more expensive than. Well, again, they typically. I mean, it really just depends what you pick out. I mean, kind of like the mdx, by the time you pick the base package and then one that might have $[MONEY_AMOUNT] worth of options, you know, certainly there's some added costs, but they still have some good deals and good programs and certainly if you have some equity in your car, you know, that would be able to be used as well. Like I said, the biggest challenge is just going to be, you know, seeing what you got and trying to figure out if we can make a deal. Is there a good time that you could really do two things? I mean, again, one, we need to see if we even have something that you like. Again, you know, the [ORGANIZATION] obviously is probably a little bit longer than your MDX. And I don't know if you have any issues with fitting in a garage or anything like that. I mean, we could try to figure that out for you if that's the case and maybe get you some dimensions. But, you know, the bigger question is just going to be, you know, making sure, obviously, like I said, that you like the vehicle. We can appraise your vehicle, get our payoff from our [ORGANIZATION] store, see how many [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] of equity you have and try to use that towards the purchase for you and see if it works. Okay. Okay. I mean, just like off the top of your head, does that sound like a crazy thing that would like, is it a waste of my time to even think about that or. Listen, I mean, the reality is, is again, there are some variables. I mean, I've seen Most of the MDXs because the residuals are very real time. And those [ORGANIZATION] actually have some good resale value to them that have, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] of equity. Well, I mean that on a lease, on a [DURATION] [DURATION] lease, if you've got [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], that's $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] right there. So we're a lot closer. We have some inventory we're going into. You know, I mean, right now, obviously, like I said, they started our [EVENT] [EVENT] advertising, so we got programs. You know, it really just depends on. It really depends on you. And if I have something that you like, I mean, that's been the hardest part for really 90% of our customers because I only have 138 cars in stock, so I can only sell 138 cars to people. So it's certainly a little bit challenging. But you definitely have a foot ahead of many other people that, you know, certainly are in a wrong product or, you know, I don't know a lot about your car. If it was in an accident, if it looks brand new, if the tires have been replaced recently. I mean, there are some things that I don't really know. So, yeah, it does throw me for a little bit of a loop. But again, listen, we are here to make deals. If it's at all possible to make a deal. That's what we're trying to do. Okay. Okay. All right. I. So you're saying the [ORGANIZATION] has the third row. The [ORGANIZATION] is our. Is our third row vehicle. Yeah. Again, like I said, if you. If you want to go on our website and just take a picture or, you know, basically, like I said, look at some of the pictures of the vehicle. Yeah. Are you local or are you. Are you long distance or what is. What is. I live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], so I'm pretty, like, not so far. Yeah, I live like this [LOCATION] [LOCATION], so. Yeah. But yeah, like I said, if you'd like to. I don't know what your schedule is. Like, if you. Maybe tomorrow or Saturday when you have a little bit of free time. You know, I don't want to take up too much time, really. I would just kind of like to introduce you to the vehicle, make sure it's not too big, make sure you like it, get your vehicle fully evaluated by one of our professionals, and then we can call the [ORGANIZATION] store and get your payoff. Is the vehicle in your name or a [MARITAL_STATUS] or. It's in my name. Okay. So all we would need to get your payoff is the last day to the VIN and the last four of your social. So that's pretty easy. So, yeah, like I said, I mean, you know, it's a complimentary test drive. You know, there's not anything that's really required just to get an experience with [ORGANIZATION]. See if the brand fits you, and we can try to see if we can make the numbers work. I mean, that's. That's the hardest part of our job, you know, from three row standpoint. I mean, again, I got one car, so if you need the three. Right. That's going to be the one. Oh, you only have one. You only have one. Oh, no, but okay, but you have, like, different colors and stuff like that, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. I have multiple Q7s. I think I have. I think I have 10 or 12 in stock of the Q7s. Okay. It's a very fortunate time of the year for us because right now obviously, is essentially where we got the most inventory. Kind of preparing for the summer months gets us kind of through that [DATE_INTERVAL]. So you did call it the right time rather than call it in [DATE_INTERVAL] and ask me how many I got left, because by then I don't have that many. Okay. And is it better to get like a [DATE_INTERVAL] rather than the [DATE_INTERVAL]? Like, is it, you know, kind of. Well, yeah, it's kind of like anything again, right now. I mean, when you. When you're buying the very first again. And I think that this has been A little different car business than, you know, the last [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. You know, it's like if you're leasing, it's always good, you know, to try to get the newest model year with the most incentives. But at the same time, there's just not a lot of incentives out there from the manufacturer. Right now, it's really, we are. We finished number three in the country for retail sales. So we're probably one of the most aggressive out there, obviously, just in pricing of our vehicles. It's just a matter, like I said, trying to match the customer with the car, making sure the payments obviously kind of fit into an affordability range. I mean, again, I just. The only thing I'm a little cautious about, you know, before I give you too much advice, is, I mean, are you like paying like 450amonth or anything crazy or what? Exactly. I'm paying [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But they knew that. That's why they wrote the letter to me. I mean, they. Well, again, I get you. But again, looking at vehicles in the price range, you know, certainly is a challenge because my [DATE_INTERVAL], I could probably do that with your equity all day long because that vehicle starts in the [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] range, you know, which is probably. I mean, I would imagine your MDX was probably a [MONEY_AMOUNT] R MSRP. Is that pretty close, I think? Yeah, I think so. I think it was higher. A little higher, yeah. I mean, again, like I said, just looking at the price range. So again, if you're going to something that's. That maybe, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] more, again, you know, I certainly, If I could. If I could do the payment on it on a [DATE_INTERVAL], obviously, and do that same payment on a [ORGANIZATION], I wouldn't have very many Q7s left. You know what I mean? I'd have a whole lot of [DATE_INTERVAL]. So I just. Like I said, we don't. I don't want to make sure we're over, you know, over promising and under delivering, but it's seeing a value. Have you. Have you checked with [ORGANIZATION] and see if they can put you in a new MDX for that payment or what do you. I don't know what everybody else. I didn't even. I didn't even check with [ORGANIZATION] yet. We're just starting the process. You know, I will, to be honest. I. I'm not wanting to. You know, that's sort of my last choice because I'm looking for something different. Sure, I get it. We get that. Occasionally when people have had like I've had four outings, I want something. Yeah, yeah. I've had already a bunch of [ORGANIZATION]. The biggest challenge for us is just the payment, you know, that I had [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago versus obviously the same payment now. It's just, it's not fair. Even with [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] of equity, it's still a very good deal. It's just a matter of making sure that again one, you like the car and us seeing exactly how aggressive I could get. But if you pick out something like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Well, I mean, well tell me what, what do [ORGANIZATION] go for? I mean what are usually the leases on that? They, they start obviously in the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] and you can, you can get them, to be honest with you, you can get them up to $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Obviously they come with bigger engines and performance products and, and heads up displays and massaging seats and I mean they do all kinds of things but we don't, we don't need all of that. Yeah, exactly, exactly. So a lot of times it's just a matter of, you know, what I'd recommend doing is taking a look at our website, looking, looking at what's out there. Have some lease payments and specials and you know, all the stuff that's out there and see what's out there for you. Again, if it works out, you know where you like to come in. And like I said, worst case scenario, I'm assuming you're probably going to get out and you're going to test drive some cars. The good news is I'm the first stop off of [LOCATION], so to get to anybody else you got to pass me. Okay. Would you, would you say this is a hard, like a weird question but would you say that your car is like comparable with like the [ORGANIZATION] Palisades or like the [ORGANIZATION] Telluride, like along like this, those same lines or like. Yeah, well, the Telluride, I mean just from a size perspective, the Telluride you might find to be a little bit bigger. But again like I said, it's you know, what's in the car. But I mean I've seen those Tellurides obviously, I mean they're, they started, I saw one obviously that was like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So I mean again, I know they go to different things but I mean that's a, that's a key line. You know, with [ORGANIZATION] we are a luxury brand. You know, obviously as a [NATIONALITY] performance brand as well. I mean we do give you a luxury amenities that kind of come with it when you're looking at your [ORGANIZATION], I'm assuming, obviously, when you go to the dealerships, they have loaner cars and things like that. I mean, certainly some of the other brands will be a little less expensive, but they won't have as many of the amenities that you're looking at. It's kind of like going to a [ORGANIZATION] store and looking at an Avalon versus going to the [ORGANIZATION] store and looking at a GS. The [ORGANIZATION] store is going to have loaner cars and things like that for you, but the [ORGANIZATION] store won't. And they're very similar, but one may be a little bit less expensive. The biggest thing is just going to be really drive three or four vehicles, find one that you like and look at some payments. Some vehicles you may have an advantage with. Certainly with [LOCATION], we have, well, like I said, we have a [ORGANIZATION] store, so we're able to take in some of those vehicles. Every manufacturer won't be able to take in your trade because they have to have a [ORGANIZATION] store in their corporate structure or an [ORGANIZATION] store in their corporate structure. So again, some might be cheaper on one end, but can't take your car. You know, other might be a little bit more expensive, but can. And you can maybe get a little bit more car for the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Like I said, the biggest challenge is probably going to be for you. You want something different. Let's. Let's really. Let's narrow down what you want and like I said, test drive some things. I mean, this should be an exciting time for you. You're gonna. You're gonna get something different. Yeah, I'd like to. Yeah. Yeah. But I don't want to spend way too much more, you know, like. Yeah, 100% understand. The biggest challenge that I'm gonna. I'm gonna give you is keep an open mind, see what's out there in some different brands. Again, you know, you're looking for third row, so you pretty much got to narrow down because, you know, every brand doesn't have, you know, three or four or five vehicles that have third row. They probably got one or two. So again, good news is, is go out, have some fun, test drive some things. The best vehicles to test drive are the [OCCUPATION] cars, because if you wreck it, it's not yours. Okay, sounds good. Well, when would you like to schedule? Maybe you're. You're. You're. You're kind of, like I said, just to start, because worst case scenario, you got every brand on [LOCATION] [LOCATION], so it's all on One [LOCATION]. Yeah, I think I might come in. I'd like to come in on Monday, if possible. Okay. Morning or afternoon? Let me think. Hold on one second. Let me check my schedule. Okay, Morning would be good. Okay. Do you want to. Do you want to think, like early morning? [TIME], what is your. [TIME] is good. Okay, so [TIME], Monday morning again, are you [LOCATION] [LOCATION] or [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay, so you're probably closer to the turnpike. I. I'm all the way [LOCATION] [LOCATION], like by. Okay, yeah. So you're closer to the turnpike. Okay, so I'd recommend, obviously, kind of just heading down, pick up the turnpike, you know, shoot up to [LOCATION]. It'll probably be the quickest for you. And then at that point, obviously, you're just going to head east. And I will be from the turnpike. I believe I am two and a half miles from the turnpike. Unfortunately, I'm going to be the last dealership on here as you get off. What's the address? I'm in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. And this is the [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. Again, I'm assuming obvious. Like I said, I see your name here on Caller id. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, it's. My first name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Is this the best number? Yes. If for any reason, obviously I'm going to be delayed or anything like that, I'll be sure to give you a courtesy call. If for some reason you're not going to make it or something like that, if you wouldn't mind, just give me a courtesy call back. Let me give you my direct line. Yes. Yes, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, so you can give me a call. For some reason you're going to be running late or not going to be making or need to reschedule, feel free to reach out. Other than that, I'll see you Monday at [TIME]. Just ask for me at the desk. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Thanks, [PERSON_NAME]. Talk to you soon. Thanks. Bye.

Like [TIME], [TIME] Thursday? No, I don't have [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. The latest I'd be able to schedule you for that type of repair would be [TIME]. I don't think I'll make it in time for that. Let's do Saturday at that [TIME] something. What was it again? [TIME]. Yeah, that will do. Then we can actually look at it and see what hoses probably need to be replaced, I think. No problem. And then would you be waiting with your vehicle or dropping it off? Waiting. Okay. And then, yeah, hopefully it doesn't take too long to park, so it can take anywhere from [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Just so you're aware, if you'd like to arrange transportation or we do offer a Lyft ride within a 15 mile radius. Yeah, I should be fine. Yeah. Okay. And then would you mind verifying your email address? [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Good job. Thank you very much. And let's see. Sorry, one moment. Oh, you took your time. Thank you very much. I went ahead and I ran your VIN number and you have no open recalls at this time, which is great. Did you have any other service concerns at this time? No. I guess I'll see you then. On this Saturday. You said they'll call me today then when they get. Yes, I will go ahead and leave a message for them. That way they can give you a call back with that approximately recall.

"Referral lead from [ORGANIZATION]. Sure. Just a moment. Sa. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. What information can I get for you? Yes, I want to see. Ask a couple questions on a vehicle you have for sale, a used truck. Okay. The stock number is C53359 [DATE_INTERVAL] white Silverado. That's it. Double cab. Yep. Four wheel drive. Yep. Yeah. So what are your add ons as far as. Did you add on? Because obviously, you know, there's some feeds that come with mine. What all do you add to your product? So it's going to be [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], and that includes your $[MONEY_AMOUNT] sales tax. Okay. Now I live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Is that any different? It will be a little bit different. Yep. A little bit higher fees for the. The title and like registration, stuff like that. And then you know that you don't have anything different. Y' all don't add any of this crap like protection plans, all that bull crap people add to them. No, I mean they're option. Those are optional. Okay. Like extended warranty and stuff like that. I got you. I got. Yeah. And that I understand that stuff. So also, and because I live. Well, I live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION], which. Which is just below [LOCATION] and just above [LOCATION]. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. So I don't even know how far I am from [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. That's where you. Yeah, we're about. We're about like [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] [LOCATION] of [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Oh, that's not too bad. That's not too bad. Okay, is there any more negotiation on your price that you've got for us? Okay, is there any more negotiation on your price? And the other thing too, is, is it better to finance through. Do you offer any additional benefits to finance it through you or if I just come and pay for it, does it make any difference? I mean, we would be able to work with you better definitely, if you finance with us. Okay. Yeah, we work with about 30 different lenders. Okay, well. And I don't have a problem with that. I'm getting it for my business. I have a small construction business and I just. I need. I need me. And double cabs are what I prefer because I can carry lumber in it better than a crew cab. And they send us anyway. They seem, I guess, a little harder to sell. Not everybody's looking for them. But anyway, listen, what's your name? And are you open on Saturdays? Yes, sir, we are. Okay. What was your name again? My name's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. What's your name? My Name's [PERSON_NAME].

I'm, I'm, I'm an old. I'm in my [PERSON_AGE] and I'm not, you know, I've bought plenty of cars in my life, so I don't want to waste your time. I don't want you to waste my time. But it looks like the car is in pretty good shape. What I can see. And I put a lot of miles on a vehicle, and so I'm just trying to find something that's reasonable with a lot, with fewer miles as possible. Let me do this. Can I give you my email address? And then if you can just send me whatever information that you have about. I mean, I've seen it on the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] site. But also if you can just kind of give me. I have great credit. I don't have any blemishes on my credit, so credit should not be an issue with me whatsoever. But I would at least like to know, you know, if you can kind of give me some ballpark finance interest rate. Because my bank, locally, I do have a couple options with them and they have actually decent rates right now. But I just get, you know, I don't have a problem just doing it through you guys, to be honest with you. Right. I mean, that makes things a little bit easier, you know, able to come in and I mean, we could, I could even, you could even get all that set up before I get here. I could send you the link to the application. We can get all that approved and ready to go. Yeah, yeah. But what I'd love, you know, obviously I'd like to come take a look at it before I make a full decision. But like I said, I don't, I don't want to burn. I don't want to spin my wheels. You know, if, like I said, I talked to some [OCCUPATION] and they just want to add all these stupid prices, you know, additional things on it, I'm just not interested in doing it. So. All right, look at my email address if you don't mind taking a few minutes and just send me some of that. Perfect. And what I can do out there, [PERSON_NAME], as well, I'll go up there and take like a walk around video of the truck kind of giving you a firsthand, you know, look at the condition of it. And I mean, it's a, it's the one. It was a one owner, one owner truck doesn't have any accidents or damage reported on it. It was a personal lease that just Got turned in and okay, when we. When we got in, we put. If it's a lease, does that mean it was a non smoker? Would they not let us smoke if they lease? Do you know that? Not necessarily, but most of the time. Most of the time they don't. I mean, because they know that they got turned in the car at the end of the day, lease or buy it out. But I'll go out there and, you know, put my nose in it and see. And see if I smell anything. Yeah. And like when we got. When we got it in, we. I mean, we did we go through a full pre delivery inspection and everything we put. Looks like we put four new tires on there. Bouncing mounted those, replaced the rear brake pads and rotors. Okay. And I believe the front. The front ones were as well. Like it's got all new brakes. Okay. All right, cool. Very good. Yeah. Well, you can just kind of get some of that info on it and, and send that to me. And unfortunately I'm kind of busy this week because I'd love to try and go up there this weekend. This weekend I forget freaking [EVENT] [EVENT], so it's gonna be stupid down here at the beach. But. But anyway, but let me see if you can just send me some info and let me see what I can figure out. All right, sounds good. We'll do. We'll be in touch. [PERSON_NAME], thank you so much.

The Leaf collection is a special assemblage of cars pack carefully chosen from across the country that are truly unique with regard to equipment, color, miles, condition and most importantly value. These are the finest cars around. So it's no surprise is [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yes, hi. I was wondering. I purchased a vehicle from you guys. Yes, sir. Last it was [DATE_INTERVAL] and I. I got a warranty added to it. Okay. And I'm just trying to figure out how long that warranty is good for. Are you able. Okay, you got it in [DATE_INTERVAL]? Yeah. First thing. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. Yes. [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID]. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. You got it from [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Correct. And let's see. [PERSON_NAME] did your paperwork, right. He's not there anymore. Should be able to pull it up here in a second because we scan all the stuff in now. Yeah. Okay. Come on. Does it say when I got the car? I keep on thinking it was [DATE_INTERVAL]. [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] [PHONE_NUMBER], [DATE]. Oh, okay. Let's see here. Do you need to use it? What's that? Do you need to use the warranty? Yes. Correct. Did you get. Well here I can tell you I got an extent. I think I paid for the thing was expiring one. I was. I might have went to [DATE_INTERVAL]. I'm not sure how I know there was still a warranty on it. So what it has. What it has, is it in probably either has a [DURATION] [DURATION] from original insurance date or [DURATION] [DURATION] because it's a certified pre owned car. Right? Right. Correct. So if you bought the extra [DURATION] it would be [DURATION] [DURATION] from the original in [ORGANIZATION] date. So let me pull that up. I gotta look at that with a different screen. Right. But I can do it for you. Also, when you purchase and extend it only can go another [DURATION] for a Maserati. The CPO program we have, you get a [DURATION] [DURATION] unlimited mile warranty from the original in [ORGANIZATION] date. And then you get the opportunity to extend that to make it [DURATION] [DURATION] from the original in [ORGANIZATION] date. So it sounds like I might have another [DURATION]. If you're looking at [DATE_INTERVAL], either got [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION]. So let's see here. You got the [DURATION] [DURATION] CPO. It starts [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. So you're good until [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay. So [DURATION] [DURATION], that means you can take it to. Yeah, yeah. You got [DURATION] [DURATION] from now. So if. If something happens other than trim pieces like buttons and knobs, you're covered. Oh, okay. And it shows. What did I pay for that? Does that show at all for that? It won't show. It was probably [MONEY_AMOUNT], I think back then it was [DATE_INTERVAL]. Now it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, right. Yeah, that sounds about right. Okay. Yep. But you sure it's good till next [DATE_INTERVAL]? Yes, sir. Next [DURATION]. Okay. I'm just verifying because I see the value of the car keeps on going down pretty. Pretty substantial. Okay. I guess that's all I needed. Okay. Yeah, I'm looking. Might even trade in. But I'll touch base with [PERSON_NAME]. Working with in the future. Okay. Thanks for your help. Thank you. You're welcome.

Yeah. Yeah. When's they going up? I don't. I hadn't. We were just told yesterday they were about to go up. Yeah, I think so. The board met Wednesday and decided that they were going to take them up for a little while. So. Ms. [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. How are you doing? Good, how are you? So that's. I just let you know that ahead of time, too. That's one reason why he's wanting to jump on a truck asap is because. To get the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Gotcha. And he found one at the [ORGANIZATION] dealership in [LOCATION]. And we went last night to look at it, and the freaking people sold it. And they knew we were coming yesterday to potentially purchase the damn thing. So. Yeah. Yep, that happens now more than it ever has. But listen to this, [PERSON_NAME]. We go in and we were like, you know, is the AP4 here? Or whatever. And, oh, well, we sold that yesterday. And I was like, okay. Well, the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] never called to tell us. And he was supposed to call and tell us so we didn't waste the trip to [LOCATION]. And they were like, well, who was it? And we spit off his name. And they were like, oh, well, he's not here. How about we leave? And not even [DURATION] [DURATION] later, he calls and he's there. And it was the same guy that we were talking. One of the same three we were talking to in the lobby. That sucks. So these are. So we have four of them, and they're 1, 2, 3. Four of them is all retail sold units. Means they was ordered sold. We have no AP4s. That is. Let me check. That's the ones that's getting here. Those will be here pretty soon, but the rates will be up way before these next one. Well, we don't even have no More coming. We got a couple of Denali's. He thought about a Denali too, but he's pre set on an at 4. Yes. I mean, that's a totally different truck than the Denali for sure. We only have one of those black. I mean, he has to have white. Yep. All right. Does he want the new body style? I'm assuming not. Or was that the new body style up there last night? There was a 23. Okay. That'd be the old body style. Okay. Then he. He's good with the new one because it has the bigger screen in it, right? Yeah, that's the. That's what everybody's wanting now. Okay, so that's why they're hot, Right? If it gets here and something don't work out, I can call you. I mean, if you hadn't found one. Please, please, please. They have one, but it's not leveled out or anything. And they are offering them [MONEY_AMOUNT] for his trade in? Yes, but it's not leveled out and it doesn't have tinted windows, which obviously the tenant windows he was fine with. It was the whole leveling out. He's going to talk to him about making it level for him. Yeah. Who has it? The [ORGANIZATION] dealership in [LOCATION]. Can you get it? No, we can't. We can't. They won't. The only way they would do that is if they would charge us like, probably [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] over what they got in it. And then it wouldn't even be beneficial at that time for you? No, not at all. Okay. That's what I needed to know. Yeah. If one of those deals don't work out, just either call me or email me at the credit [ORGANIZATION] or I can give you my cell phone if. Yeah, let me get your cell phone. And I'm. I'm gonna just call you. That way you have mine. That's it? Yes. All right, I'm calling you now. And that'll be mine. Yep. And shoot me a text whenever you need. All right?

Her [MARITAL_STATUS] granddad [OCCUPATION] from the power company. Okay, that's fine. That works. When did you send her? About [DURATION] [DURATION] ago.

And look, if. When I find out rates are going up, if we get an application in before they actually change, then we're good. So I'll give you a heads up when I know rates are about to go up. And that way, if you have somebody, you can just tell them to go online and fill out the application. Okay, I'll do that. Hey, [PERSON_NAME] hadn't called you because he said. He said, man, everybody at my power company, they died. I said, well, they work there, so call her to say is, I got a relative at the power company. I don't ask any more questions. All right, well, I'll have him call you later. Yeah, that's fine, because I don't ask any questions or anything. I'm like, got somebody that works for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yep. All right.

I'm looking. I want the Rogue. I can tell you what I want. Okay. I already know. Okay. I. I want the all wheel drive. Okay. I want the power seat. Okay. I want the dark cloth interior. Huh. And I want the pearl white. Okay. Does that make it the sl? I think because of the power seat. Nope. The sv. SV is the slide. What's the difference between the SL and the sv? Well, in the sl, you will get the leather for sure. Because on the sv, you can choose leather or non leather. Okay. You get the panoramic moonroof. You get the built in navigation. On the nsl, you also get a [ORGANIZATION] sound system. Okay. You get the memory seat. Okay. And you get premium wheels, premium tires. So that's pretty much it. Because you can get an SV with premium package, which is also the leather, the moonroof, panoramic moonroof. You just don't get the premium sound or the built in navigation. You get [ORGANIZATION] carplay. Yeah. Okay. I don't. I don't want leather. Okay. So no leather. Gloss. No leather. The moonroof would be great if it comes with it, but it's not a priority. It doesn't come separated. Only comes in the package. Leather and moonroof together. Okay. So. All right, so can you tell me, can you give me a price on that? So pearl white. Pearl white with cloth seats. And it will have power. C. Take a look in here. Let me take a look at. What is your name, sir? And you can call me back if you want. No, that's okay. I mean, unless you could want to do something else. I can call you back, but I have the. Yes. And my name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. What's your last name, [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. All right. And you are here at the [LOCATION] area. I'm out. [PERSON_NAME]. I know that. They have the car. I want in, [LOCATION]. Oh. I'm basically calling to see what your price is. Oh, okay. Well, if they have the car. So is that what you're looking for? The road? Sv Is that what you were looking at? Yeah. All right. So let's just see if I have one somewhere in this area. Okay. So let's bear with me for a minute. If unless you got something to do, I can call you back, but if not, just hang on. Okay. And it has to be an all wheel drive. Right? That's, that's a must. It's a must. Yeah. All right, all right. So there you go. So let's just take this, let's see if we can actually find his vehicle beside there. And the price, I mean, the price is the price. It's not going to be different than. I don't think they'll be much different than [ORGANIZATION] as they're charging you unless they're overcharging you. Okay, well, let me know. And I, I, my intent is I, I plan on buying it this weekend actually, so just so you know that. Oh, yeah, that's okay. All right, well, that's good. I'll come down this weekend. I don't know, I don't know if I have it here. I'm gonna take a look. That we do, actually. I don't have it here in this lot right now. I'm gonna tell you that for sure. I don't have it here, but I do have actually six dealerships that are [ORGANIZATION] and we own all six of them. So in reality we can get the car. It's just a matter of finding what you want, like the all wheel drive and the, the Pro [MARITAL_STATUS] will be simple, but just finding the make sure it's an all wheel drive. And sometimes we do have those with other packages. So I gotta make sure I tell you exactly what you know what you want. So what you want is, you know, is the Rogue. So I know that it's the Rogue because it has a power seat and it is closed because then the leather will have the premium package, which you don't care for the moonroof, and that's bringing up the price a little bit more. So let me look for this rogue and we'll put it white and then we put your drivetrain. We'll put your drivetrain as an all wheel drive, which shows that I have 12 and they're white. So let's see. And to see what we have. Okay, let's take a look. Can you hold on for just a second? Of course, sir. Of course. All right, sir. So, and are you looking at leasing it or buying it? Buying it. Buying. Okay. All right, so it shows that we have. Can you hear me? Go ahead. Yeah. It shows that we, it shows that we have one in our inventory. Whether it's already arrived or not. I will have to call it in and call with my other dealership, see if it is there already or if it's arriving, you know, but it is an all wheel drive and it's a Pro wide and it is the charcoal interior. This one runs out right now with an all wheel drive center. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yep. Without your taxes license, we have to add your tax license and registration. Now if, if it is something that we can help you with, I'll be glad to see we can give you, you know, give you a little hand in there maybe, I don't know, [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] off and see if we can make you a deal. You know, I have to call it in if it is, you know, already at our dealership or if it's arriving like I said. But it has all the safety features which I'm sure you already seen them with Blind Spot. You get the Pro Pilot assist, your lane Assist, [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay, Android Auto, remote Star, you know. So you said [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay. Is that what you said? Yes, it is. [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay and Android Auto. Okay. Okay. Yeah. All right. So I, I mean can you tell me what you can sell that car for? I'm telling you, I just told you if we can make you a deal, you know what A [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] will do it. That will be a way [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And. All right. And that's. And that's. I'm assuming that's the best deal you can give me on it. And I need to check. It's real close to the other one. But let me. Can you, can you send me. Could you send me an email with your name and that information and go ahead. I'm sorry, I was gonna say but I do need to check to make sure this car is already available and it's already. Cause it only shows that generic picture which it could be in route to get here. And we do get cars, I mean every day, every [DURATION] [DURATION]. It just depends how the delivery trucks are doing. But you know I gotta call it in and say hey is this car here? Is it a pre order for somebody? Is it kind. But I do show that we have one so I don't wanna, you know, so let me, let me tell you, this is what I will do right now. I'm going to send you a text and this text will be my, my information, you know, my name. And then you can reply with. With an email. I will be glad to provide you with that information and see if we can. Yeah, okay. Text is fine. And yeah, so you say [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And it would. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And that it doesn't have the moonroof but it has the all wheel drive. It's the pro white. Okay. And would you mind sending me in the text everything that it has on it? Would you mind that? No, no, I don't mind. Yeah, I will send you what it has. Oh, one more thing. What, what is the warranty on that? [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. [DURATION]. [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] on the powertrain. That's great. Can you tell me this, can you tell me what the cost of a [DURATION] [DURATION] bumper to bumper would be? [DURATION] [DURATION]? Yeah. So [DURATION] [DURATION], you know and I'm going to tell you because I used to work with a company here then they had that, that [DURATION] [DURATION] and I said, hey, we can give you a [DURATION] [DURATION] warranty on it, which is basically your powertrain warranty. Okay. For [DURATION] [DURATION]. Now a lot of those offers are only offered at that place. If you were to take it anywhere else. They will not honor that. That is just at the dealership. You buy it and like I said, we had it here with the group that I had before that I was employed. So and when they put parts of it after the [DURATION] [DURATION] 60, which is normal, you know that your [DURATION] [DURATION] [ORGANIZATION] guarantee, if the powertrain falls on the, let's say the [DURATION] [DURATION] and you're already at 80,000, they do not guarantee they are going to be brand new parts. It'll be whatever makes the work, you know what I mean? So a lot of the dealerships that I have known that do that is because most people will trade a car in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. They're looking already training. So yeah, we'll give you a powertrain warranty for [DURATION] [DURATION]. At the end of the day you probably will never use it because I played for [DURATION] [DURATION] and they never even used that car. By the [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], everybody looking at trading the cars in reality that [DURATION] [DURATION] became nothing. You see what I mean? Okay. But to put your cost of it, I don't sell warranties and I don't want to tell you a quote, this is this much I don't know because then it will have to be with finance. How long do you want to extend it and what do you want to call it? Do you want to have a deductible? You don't want to have deductible. There is many different warranties, my friend. There's a lot, lot of them and you can choose what fits into your needs. Okay, well I appreciate you sharing that with me. That is something I know that I know I lived in. I don't know if you know the cities Here, I live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], and I know there was an [LOCATION] dealership that was promoting that, and I have a gm. I had [OCCUPATION] that work there, and they're like, you know what? Within the [DURATION] that we worked there, nobody ever used that [DURATION] [DURATION]. Because by the third year, fourth year, they're already looking at selling the car, trading it for something else, or the fourth year, [DURATION] [DURATION]. I mean, there is exceptions to the rule. There is people that keep their cars for [DURATION] [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION], then it's okay. But again, if you do happen to move or to relocate, you cannot replace it or fix it somewhere else. It has to be at the dealership. Okay, well, I appreciate you letting me know that, because I didn't know that. Yeah. Unless you buy a [ORGANIZATION], I think it has a powertrain warranty for [DURATION] [DURATION], as at every [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Oh, do they? I think they do. I. That's what they always said. But again, I don't work for [ORGANIZATION]. I don't know what they do. I do know that about [DURATION] [DURATION] that we used to offer when I was with this company here, and then they resold it. They do that. We never had nobody coming back in [DURATION] [DURATION]. Well, I'm having problems because by that, then they already had sold the car or traded, you know? Yeah. You know, that's. That's your average typical customer. In a span of [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], they're looking at selling or trading it. Okay. Hey, I'm. I'm driving right now, and I'm gonna lose you in just a minute, so I don't want you to think I was being rude and hung up. No, no, it's okay. It's okay, [PERSON_NAME].

"Hi [OCCUPATION] Touch some of your sales. One moment. Good afternoon. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME], how can I help you? Hi [PERSON_NAME]. I was just wondering how long right now is the wait for [ORGANIZATION] F150 Lightning in the lowest model, the Pro model? If you wanted to order a Lightning Pro. Let me see if those order banks are open. I will tell you I have some very good news. We do have two Lightnings that are on the ground right now that just became available and we got them just in time for [EVENT] [EVENT], the day itself. And you know, I'd love to show those to you. Are you here local, in the [LOCATION] area? Yeah. What kind of models and what's the MSRP on them? They're both Lariats. I think the MSRP is in the [MONEY_AMOUNT] there. All right. And the Pro model did down in the [MONEY_AMOUNT], right? Yeah, depending on how you have those configured. Now the Pro model, is there a reason in particular that the Pro model caught your eye? Is it just the price point or is there a particular kind of feature that you saw there on the Pro model that. Actually I just saw one today and I thought for the price point it looked good. I mean it just as nice as any truck I've seen. It was a good looking truck. Go ahead. As far as the order goes, is that something that you do online or is that something you do through the [OCCUPATION]? We would do that through the dealership here. I could submit that. As long as the order banks are open, we could absolutely submit an order for you. Now have you had a chance to drive the Lightning yet? No, but I have an electric car. So I've been with electric for a long time. So it sounds like the thing to do would be if I want to make that commitment to create an order through you, if the order bank's open. Otherwise I could look at maybe looking at a lariat, but that would be in the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes, well, that's where the MSRPs are. Now naturally they do all have a markup on them, especially the Pro model. Believe it or not, we have a. I would say our highest demand is really in that Pro model trim because of the fleet customer demand on those. And [ORGANIZATION] is. We are seeing more of the Lariat Platinum limited trims than we are Pro or xlt. Now when we have a Pro or an xlt, naturally we do have a markup on those as well. Not nearly as high as you would see from a number of other [OCCUPATION], but naturally still with the market being substantially north of msrp we're still sub market on our pricing, but that might get you pretty close to where a lariat MSRP would be. And being [EVENT] [EVENT], I might have a strong case to make for putting a compelling offer to my [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to make you a great deal on the lariat that we have on the ground. Would you be willing to take a look at it, take it for a drive and see if I can make you a great deal on this truck? No, not right now. I want to think about what you said and then I just kind of want to know what the process would be like if you happen to have a pro in the lot. I would have come over, but I'm going to do something and then I'll probably give you a call back. Yeah, hey, fair enough. This is what I can do. As I have [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] become available, I could shoot you over some information on them, let you know when they're available because as I said, it does happen, but they do sell pretty quickly. At least let me let you know when I've got one handy. I presume this number you're calling me from, that number is the best number to get a hold of you. Are you calling from the [LOCATION] area? No, I'm from the [LOCATION] area, but I'm living up here. Oh, cool. Number two, I moved here from [LOCATION] about [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. I called you in between a little break that I had. Appreciate all the information and I'll get back in touch with you when I think about a little bit. Yeah, no problem. Your name, sir? My name is [PERSON_NAME].

If it's a good match, man, I'd love to earn your business. Do you have a Gmail or Yahoo? What's a good email address? I can send that over to you right now.

Yeah, because we've had some issues getting a hold of a couple dealerships. I'm looking for an extended range [ORGANIZATION] Mach E, all wheel drive. You guys have any of those on the lot? Last I checked, we had 13 incoming. Let me see if any of those are going to be available. You have nothing unlocked today, though. Oh, I got a few unlocked. Let me just make sure we got an extended. Okay. So it looks like a grabber blue, extended battery, rear wheel drive. You want all wheel drive? All wheel drive? Yeah, it's [LOCATION]. You got to have all wheel drive. Do you want to. [NATIONALITY] would. The package would be the best. But those are like almost impossible get your hands on. We had one. We just sold it yesterday. Yeah, they're almost impossible to get your hands on, it seems like. Yeah. Okay. So it looks like. I mean, I have a couple variations. I have two GTs. Don't want a GT, can't afford that. Okay. And then I. It looks like I have a extended battery, vapor blue Premium and a. Let me do this. What's a good number for you? I'm gonna run out there and check. I have 1, 2, 6 that are scheduled to be here. Either they were supposed to be here Sunday or today. And those are available. So I just need to see which ones actually came in. Okay. A couple things is when I look at your website, you guys have some of them at great price. The other ones, you guys look like. I'm just looking right now shows you guys are doing a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] markup. Is that correct? It depends on which one it is. I don't know the specifics. Sometimes we do a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] markup on the. On the vehicles that are sold because we still have to put. That's the reason why [ORGANIZATION] is going to poor electric pull electric vehicles from dealerships are talking about is because the markup, they're not gonna be doing that. But regardless, the ones that have the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] markup, [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] don't know if you saw the YouTube video. The [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] a week ago said they were gonna pull. Sure. So I just. Like I said. So like, I'm like I'm saying the ones that have a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] markup are the ones that are pre ordered, pre sold. They show a markup online. And the rest of them that do not have a markup are either one available or two unreserved orders. So what's a good number for you. Let me figure out what I got. [PHONE_NUMBER]. And just to refresh, all wheel drive, extended range. I don't care about the color. Okay. And what was your name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME].

We're looking for some 2500 and some 3000 500s. Okay. Are you looking for the. Are you looking for the regular cabs or the crew cab? We probably like a crew cab, you know, four doors for the. For just being as efficient as possible for the staff members. Right, okay. Crew cab. Two wheel drive, four wheel drive. [PERSON_NAME], you know what? I don't know. We probably get options on both. I don't see if we're gonna really need a. They're gonna have to have some towing capabilities. Obviously we're gonna be pulling some heavy stuff. Okay. Are you looking for the gas or the diesel engine? Probably diesel. Okay. Like I said, we're shopping right now. We'd like to have the same fleet, you know, have the same. The same truck for. Or just the same look, obviously, but we're looking for the 225 and two 3500. Okay. 235. Now on the 3500, are you looking for the single rear axle or the dually? Probably just a single.

What do you mean, [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT], correct? Yeah, I think we're a little bit soft.

You're going to put them under a company name? Yeah, they'll be under. They'll be bought by our company. Okay. We're not looking to lease, we're not looking to finance.

Okay. Can you give me information? This is to [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Corolla Hybrid. Is it? That's correct, yes. Is it? How is it? The mileage is 300 mile on it. From what I can tell see that I'm not in the vehicle. It looks like it may. It shows initially we bought the vehicle from wherever we got it from with about 171 miles on it. So it may have some more mileage on top of that. I don't know approximately how much. Yeah, I saw in the website like 300 in the dashboard. So that's a mile, right? It's not. No, it should Be that. Okay. Okay. Then what else is it? The color gray. Right. You see in your screen the color or. No, it's showing. I'm actually going to pop it up on the website. So at least I know what exactly which one you're looking at. Let me just go and get the stock number copied here and I'll go to our website and then be able to. To be able to recall it quickly for you. Okay. 1 PS 2. 5. 6. 5. Okay. It looks like it's underground, which is like a. Almost like a wet cement color. And it's an LE hybrid. Okay. [PERSON_NAME]. That's correct. Okay, [PERSON_NAME], I'm looking at the pictures. The pictures actually show approximately 161 miles on it. So I think what you're seeing is it says distance to empty for the fuel tank is 352 miles. So it actually has like about 160 to 170 miles on it. That's good. Getting better by the minute. What time were you anticipating coming in, [PERSON_NAME]? I'll be sure with you. Maybe [TIME], [TIME] [TIME]. Okay. Okay. [TIME] to [TIME]. Yeah, just if you can give me a call, let's say about [TIME] just to confirm, that'd be great. [TIME]? Yes. This way I can put you hold on for you. Okay. Okay, then you call me [TIME] if I will call you. Okay. I'm waiting for you. Thank you. All right, my friend, I'll talk to you here shortly. Sure. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Bye bye.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME], how can I help you? [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Did I just speak to you about a RAV4? Yes, that was. Yes. Okay. All right, I, I want to talk to you about, I want to talk to you about a little more. Okay, that's the one you're asking [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You're asking [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it, right? Correct. How long have you had the car there? Not very long. It's not even. We just took it in [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] ago. I don't even think it's. Yeah, we don't even have photos on the website for it yet. It's still new. Okay, okay, what about warranties? What kind of warranty is going to be on that car? So they offer an extended warranty, otherwise it'd be sold as is. Yeah, but when you sell it as is, don't you give it [DURATION] [DURATION]? I mean, so they go through their multi point inspections with our [OCCUPATION]. I mean, depending on what's going on with the vehicle. I realize what you have is you've got a, you've got one of those very limited driven cars and it's, and it's loaded. That's a loaded car, right? Correct. How much would that car be new today? In the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]? No, more maybe like in the high 40s. Do you want to stop by, check that? Here's my situation. I have a lady, a friend of mine who is working, she's making about [DURATION] [DURATION] a week. She basically gets paid what, every two weeks? So she makes about [MONEY_AMOUNT] every two weeks. Same thing. Same thing. All right. She has proof of income. She has not ever gotten a car. She has zero credit. No, no, nothing bad, nothing good. And I'm trying to help her get into a vehicle. She's driving my car right now. I have an older LS400 [ORGANIZATION]. Mine's like a [DATE_INTERVAL] with 160,000 miles. So my car is not worth that much money. Okay. So I wanted her to use my car as a down payment towards it. And I know that we're going to get her some credit. Established the fact that that's a low mileage car, does that make it easier to get it financed? Yes, that definitely helps. Okay, so what kind of interest are we looking at for somebody who has no credit? And let's assume we're going to put [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Let's assume you give us [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the car. Okay. All right, we're buying a car for [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You give us [MONEY_AMOUNT], then we got to pay tax and we got to pay tags. So we're going to [ORGANIZATION] like let's say $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right. What kind of interest can I expect to pay for somebody who's just getting credit for the first time? Gotcha. Yeah, that's a really good question. I mean, were you thinking about co signing or was she just going to be on the. No, no, no. I want her to establish her own credit. I don't want to take. No, I don't want to be responsible for it. Now, I know her interest is going to be high, but then maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] from now she can refinance it after she gets. We get. So she gets some credibility. Right. Because that car is going to last her a long time. Those cars go for a lot of miles. So at 26,000 miles, that car is like a brand new car. Almost exactly. I mean, I, I don't, I couldn't tell you that. It's up to the bank to, you know, decide the interest. I can, you know, definitely. I'm trying to get an idea if I could get her into this car without any cash, use the [ORGANIZATION] as the down payment and what her payments will be [DURATION] [DURATION]. She's definitely interested in the car. I know what it's going to look like. I'm sitting in [ORGANIZATION] right now in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Yeah. If you give me the opportunity to, you know, stop by, check out the vehicle, we can look at your vehicle at the same time. Yeah, but it's a long ride. I need to go over the numbers first. But we have to assume that she's going to like the RAV4. She sees they have them here, she knows what they look like. And I looked at the video. You had a video of it online. Okay, so I'm not concerned about her liking the car. I'm more concerned about what the payment around, how much the payments are going to be. Yeah. What were you guys? As close to [MONEY_AMOUNT] as possible. Gotcha. Sounds reasonable. I mean, what's the trade that's gonna help? Well, the trade's gonna be her down payment. But if, you know. But the trade, you guys don't want that. It's an old [ORGANIZATION]. You guys service the car. I've had the car there. You've serviced it in the past. But the point is, an old [ORGANIZATION] like that, you're just going to send it out to the wholesalers for [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You know, you don't make any money. You don't make no, you don't want that car. Now you want an old [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it. Gotcha. Yeah, because she doesn't have available cash right now, but she has my car that she's driving that I would give to her, and she would give that as a down payment. But what we need to talk to is the [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION]. I mean, he's got to tell us that, hey, look, somebody, he can run the numbers on that car, take into consideration, you deal with somebody that has no credit, and I could give him her Social Security number. And before I run all the way up there and we run back to get the [ORGANIZATION], which is sitting up there in [LOCATION] right now, and drive all the way back to [LOCATION], I want to find out where we're going to be, approximately. It don't have to be exact. Gotcha. Yep. And then just, I mean, from my experience, I mean, with some established credit, you're Normally looking at $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] for every $[MONEY_AMOUNT] you [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, now with having no credit, now with having no credit, it might be just a little bit more, but I mean, we'll figure all that stuff out. I mean, once you know, what can we talk? But just to get you an idea. Well, I plugged into Carvana. They have a thing of Carvana. So I plugged in the same amount of money. Yeah. Just to see what came out. And you know, the difference is when I plug in good credit, excellent credit, the payment was $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. When I plugged in bad credit, which is real bad credit, which is the extreme, the payment went to 370amonth. Right. Yep, that's right. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, but I just, But I got him in. Can I talk to the [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION]? Because if we feel like it makes sense, then we'll get the car from this. Yeah. So what do you mean? You were, you were saying that you were looking for a general idea. I mean, then, now you're telling me you think it's going to be a foul a [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Every [MONEY_AMOUNT], right? That's correct. So say in this case, [ORGANIZATION] [MONEY_AMOUNT], then you're looking at, you know, maybe [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right. More or less. And then like you said, that little ballpark figure like you plug into the Carvana calculator with good Credit. Yep. Maybe [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then like you said, it could range a little bit more, you know, with. With no credit. Right. Well, is the [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] available? So do you have a question or. I mean, I'm trying to figure out how I can help you out. Well, what we want to do is give the [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] her secure Social Security number, the income. You got the car information. He can run it and tell us what it's going to be. Yeah, so, yeah, the down payment will be the [ORGANIZATION]. So whatever going to give her on the [ORGANIZATION] is going to drop the payment, right? Of course, yeah. So I could send it. Send it over your way. Send. To. Send you a link. Just if you could fill. Fill that out for me then, please, and then I'll get it over to the [ORGANIZATION]. How am I going to fill it out on my phone? I'm sitting in a car. I can't. I can't print it. Yeah, no problem. I mean, it's. I'll give you the information right now. You write it in. So, yeah, I'm able to do it here at the store, however, filling it out via. Let me see. Let me see if I can get somebody to help. One second. Okay, you want to know, right. Hello, Mr. [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. Hey there, sir. My name is [PERSON_NAME] here. I'm helping out [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. How are you? Very good, sir. So basically, as far as policies go to protect any consumer information, we can't just take information over the phone and pull credit. Either you have to do it here in person or you just do an online credit application. It's really simple. I send you a link, you put in the name, social, income, all the information, and then it pops into. Can I do that on. Can I do that on my. Can I do that on my phone? Absolutely, yeah. As long as you got WI Fi or data, you just click the link. It sends you directly to the application. You just fill it out and then let [PERSON_NAME] know when you submitted it and it should be in our system. And then we can send it to our [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] and we'll get you everything you need. Okay. I want to get an idea, and we could do that. I'll send you the. My email is. Okay, yeah, I got that here in the system. Okay. I'm already there in the system. Okay. But here's a question that we're going to need to. Need to ask. See the deposit on the car? We know what car. Okay. Okay. We're talking about your [DATE_INTERVAL] RAV4 that you have. Okay, the [DATE_INTERVAL] RAV4. Okay. That's got real low miles on it. All right. That would be a good car for her. All right. And you know she likes that. Okay. I just. I'm heading back to get to her car. All right. She's driving my car. I'M going to give her that as a deposit. Okay. So my car is not worth a lot of money to you guys. Okay. So I just, I mean, if I tell you what I have, your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] is going to give you an idea how much he's going to put on it, right off the top of his head. Because it's an old car. Yeah. I told, when I talked to [ORGANIZATION] down in [LOCATION], they were going to give me $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. They were going to put down. They were going to put down that it was [MONEY_AMOUNT] to try to get, you know, it was going to help the financing. But the point is they were only going to give me [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Right. So I'm not expecting a bunch of money on this car, but I also don't want someone to try to tell me I'm going to give you [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] either. Okay. So I mean, if we, I give you the information, I mean, I have an LS, LS400 [ORGANIZATION]. What [DURATION]? How many miles it's got 160, 000 miles, approximately. Okay. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. [DATE_INTERVAL]. Oh, that's. That is tough. I would definitely have. No, that's when. That's when they. That's when. Yeah, that's what. That's why I'm saying that's when they made them. Right. And I've had the car all these [DURATION] and she's driving it and it's got a great engine, great transmission, nice color and all that stuff. It's got good rubber on it. But, you know, eventually she's going to have to start putting some money out because when you have to fix that thing, I mean, we've been keeping it up with brakes and different stuff, but the car has been a bear. You know, it's just like your Toyotas. They want forever, right? You can't, you can't kill those things. No. And this [ORGANIZATION] is a wonderful friggin car. But I just think, you know, if she just drives it and I put it in her name, it's going to cost money. It's going to cost tags and all that. But she don't have any tags. Yeah. All right. And she was gonna put in her name, put the insurance under a sister and keep the car. But she's gonna ultimately have to deal with, I mean, so far so good because the car is a solid car, but it's, you know, little things start going along with it. But I don't know what you guys are going to put on the Car. Right. So, I mean, I would really have to confirm with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], put the vin, the miles and the condition and stuff into the system and see what it says. But here's what I have to say on the trade. You know, because it's an older vehicle, you might get different numbers at different places. But remember, [ORGANIZATION] only offered you up to $[MONEY_AMOUNT] on your car because that depended a lot on how much profit they had in the car that they're selling. We don't mark up our cars like insane. You know, I don't have $[MONEY_AMOUNT] of profit in any car here that I can just say, okay, I'll give you [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] and it's worth. But on the other hand, I would say they're not really good. They're not giving me [MONEY_AMOUNT] on the car. I know that they're only putting like [MONEY_AMOUNT] on the car. Right. So, I mean, look, how about this? Why don't we start with the, with the link for the application. And what I would recommend for you to do is, let's say, go to [ORGANIZATION], right? Get it, get it appraised. I don't have. I don't have time to run around the Cormac. Okay, well, I mean, do you have time to drop in so we can do a proper inspection and just work all the numbers out for you? It's going to be listed. The financing numbers is going to tell us. I mean, she has no credit. Okay. Is she going to be on her own? Are you financing it together? No, she. Now, if I was going to do it, then that would be a different story. I wouldn't be concerned. All right. But the kind of. I mean, when you, when you get somebody a car for the first time and they don't have any, she's a mature woman in her [PERSON_AGE] who's got a good job. She makes about 2500amonth. But the point is, she hasn't had any credit. And this will help establish her credit. I. I'm figuring your interest rates are going to be upwards towards what, about [DATE_INTERVAL]. Well, so that I don't know. That's gonna. That depends on the car and the credit. That's what we need to submit. Well, you got the car. Yes. You know what car we're buying? We're buying out. It's a RAV4 with very low miles. Okay, Right. But I need your credit and income information or your, you know, I need that submitted so I can submit it to the bank because we can say [DATE_INTERVAL] but what if it's 12? What if it's 16? You know, I don't want, we don't, we don't like to estimate on. If you say, hey, it's 850 credit scores, it's a brand new car, all right. They can do a really good estimate on a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. I know, I know what the rates are right now. So rates are higher return in here? Yeah. You know, rates aren't, aren't good anywhere. First I need to go get my car. I, I, I did. I bought a Range Rover and I'm paying 10 over 10% interest rates. Right? Yeah. On a [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] Range Rover, it's a different story. So that's why, I mean, let us send you the link. Are you able to fill it out real quick if we email it to you? Yeah, you could send the link when I pull over. I can fill it out and get it back to you. Yeah. You [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Are you, Are you [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? No, we're, we're [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. It's actually a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] dealership. Okay, good. You're not a nation. All right, that's good. Okay, look, the car you've got is a low miles RAV4. It would, it would do her well, that car. Okay, because it's got no, it's got low miles on it. Then she could get herself established for credit in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. She wants to trade it in with you guys and get something stepping up and get low interest rates. You know, it's a [OCCUPATION] another world. Right? Right. That's right. You want to help me? What, what is your first name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Yeah. She doesn't have cash right now to put down, so we got to use [PERSON_NAME]. That's fine. I mean, usually what I say in a situation like this, let's submit it to the bank and let's see what it looks like with [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] down and then we'll see what's going on with the trade and what we can do with it. Because, you know, if they look at the credit and if they require 8,000 down, doesn't really matter what the trade is because we're not going to get there. Right. But with the low miles, it is a [DATE_INTERVAL] really clean with low miles. So the bank might say some good news for us. So we just don't know until we talk to them. That's why, you know, it's better off taking the attempt on something like this because the miles are like, it's a grandmom's car, you know. Yeah. And that's. That's just. That's just what she can use. And she gets the car for [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], gets [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] for her car, and they [ORGANIZATION] it, the payments. She may be able to manage it. Okay. Nice car. Okay, so. Okay, have me over in about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION]. I'll be sitting still and I'll fill out. I can do that on my phone, right? Yes, sir, absolutely. I send it back to you. And do you have my phone number? Yes, yes, we're here. I'm working right next door to [PERSON_NAME], so he told me he just emailed the link for the credit application. When you have a chance, just let him know that you filled it out and we'll get with our [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] and. And submit it for you. Okay, great. All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you, sir. We'll be in touch. Not a problem. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Bye.",success,price_quote,RAV4,medium,True,03c7b8de5edd41ba8d0a758ac41d2840_transcript.json

It's supposed to be here any minute at [TIME], so do me a favor. The person calls to confirm. What's that? Yeah, he actually. He called and said he's going to be here, but he's like, if. He's like, if I'm not there by [TIME], [TIME], he goes, I'll definitely be there tomorrow. So I just haven't. He's trying to buy a new Rogue and. All right, but. No, I know. I got to get with. Yeah, absolutely. I got to get with [PERSON_NAME] and find out what he's going to do, you know, for you, because I know. When we last talked, I thought you were going to go through [ORGANIZATION] and buy it directly. They told me I'm not able to do that. I called them directly. Okay. That you're only allowed to do it at the dealership. Okay. Yeah. It's weird because how many you need? That's what they told me. Sorry, I'm just doing five things at once, as always. Happy [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT]. Okay, thank you. I'm working tomorrow and I work from [TIME] to [TIME], but I'm pretty sure. What time do you usually get off tomorrow? I'm off at [TIME], but. And then on Monday, we're open, it's service is closed. But Monday were [TIME] to [TIME] to [TIME] normal hours. Yeah, because that's Friday, Saturday. What's that? I said my [DURATION] off for Friday, Saturday. Right. What do you. Well, you know, keep in mind. When's your lease up on this? I gotta make my payment. I was trying to hold out. Right. No, I don't blame you. I just. Let me do this real quick. Let me see if I can get a hold of. If I can break in there because we're busy. Let me see. Because we can also. Actually, FYI, we can do this [ORGANIZATION]. You don't have to come in. Well, I want to get the warranty. I think on it too. That was another thing I had asked people that we were discussing. Right. What the bumper to bumper? Yeah, the warranty. Since you're buying it and you're going to be out of factory warranty is not a bad thing. You know normally on new cars, on a new car you don't need it. But on if you're buying yours and you're making payments on it, you definitely want in case the AC moves out, the regulator, whatever. But [ORGANIZATION] is the one that offers that. Let me do this. Let me see if I can get with [PERSON_NAME] and find out if what you know what the numbers are on it. Right. And I'll call you, I'll call you back. We can do. On a warranty. What kind of warranty do you want? That way I can get a price for you. How long did you want to [ORGANIZATION] this for too? I wanted the cheapest payment as possible. Okay. So we can go out [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION]. Which is. I'm not really. Yeah, I'm not really wanting to do that but. Well, it's the cheapest payment, you know and you know what down the road when the, you know, when things turn around. But he. You know, I'm sorry about the guy you spoke to earlier. He came to me and was telling me and I read your email. But you're. Are you going to get your own. You're going to get your own money? Because I can't. I can't get nowhere close [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I know. And I decided that if I was going to buy the warranty, I had to go through you guys. Right? You got. Yeah, you don't want to buy an aftermarket warranty. And our warranty is through [ORGANIZATION]. It's called security plus. So yeah, it's through [ORGANIZATION] at any [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] across, you know from here to [LOCATION] is definitely a way to Go. You want me to go to a different [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION], then? No, no, no, I'm saying. No, I'm saying the warranty. You can go to any [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] to get the car service when you buy the factory, when you buy an aftermarket, extended warranty, you have to go to, like, particular shops. And it's just. And you're not saving that much money. I mean, let me get them to get you a price and a payment and I'll get you some numbers. Are you putting anything down or you just want to [ORGANIZATION] the whole thing? Just [ORGANIZATION] the whole thing. And what rate can you get at your bank? Because he was saying something. You were getting [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Because we don't have any. I know, but the thing is, is that I get it and I understand that, but if I go through them, I'm probably not going to be able to get my warranty. Right? Is that how that works, or. No, no, I mean, it's on the buyer's order. You can get it. You can get the, you know, warranty included in the bottom line and then just bring us a check from your credit union or whoever's giving you that [MONEY_AMOUNT]. No, I was shopping for rates online. Okay. And it said that they could do a used car for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And that was a special they had, like, [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Who knows what it is now? Right. Okay. Because I put in the information for the car. I put in how much I needed, and then it said based on my credit score, they can give it to me for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But then I was like, I got busy and I didn't have a chance to get all my stuff together. So I can't do it, like, right now. Now my daughter's getting out of school. Now I can take care of it. So I was just gonna come to you guys and just do it and get it out of the way. Well, let me do this real quick. Let me. Yeah, let me get. Let me get some numbers. I'll get an extended warranty in there. I'll get it with zero down, and I'll let you know what numbers are. And if you're good with it, then I can probably get everything printed up to where you come in. And you don't have to go through [ORGANIZATION] or nothing like that. You can just see me and only take [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Right? That's what I was hoping we could do. So, yeah, let me see what I can do. Forget about me. No, no, I'm not, sweetie. I'll never forget about You? Yeah. That guy today was so nasty to me on the phone. Oh, my God. I couldn't believe how he was talking to me today. It was bad. I was explaining why I haven't had a chance to come in. He hung up on me mid conversation. Because I said I only deal with you. Yeah, that's pretty rare. It was really bad. I called and complained to [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, quick question. Do you have an insurance card in front of you? I just want to make sure I got the right bin. Okay, hold on a second. I can definitely get that. I mean, I'm not going to get a lease any cheaper, right? No, very expensive right now. Yeah, just a rogue SV lease I got. I just did one for a customer and it was [MONEY_AMOUNT] with [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down. If you don't put the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down, it raises it $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per thousand.

Cool beans. Thank you. You're welcome. Car. Make sure you choose the right. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME]. Are you busy today? Yeah, just. I'm here tomorrow and then I'm also here on Monday. Yeah, the thing is, my schedule is messed up. What time are you there until tonight? I've actually got an appointment. It's supposed to be here any minute at [TIME], so do me a favor. The person calls to confirm. What's that? Yeah, he actually. He called and said he's going to be here, but he's like, if. He's like, if I'm not there by [TIME], [TIME], he goes, I'll definitely be there tomorrow. So I just haven't. He's trying to buy a new Rogue and. All right, but. No, I know. I got to get with. Yeah, absolutely. I got to get with [PERSON_NAME] and find out what he's going to do, you know, for you, because I know. When we last talked, I thought you were going to go through [ORGANIZATION] and buy it directly. They told me I'm not able to do that. I called them directly. Okay. That you're only allowed to do it at the dealership. Okay. Yeah. It's weird because how many you need? That's what they told me. Sorry, I'm just doing five things at once, as always. Happy [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT]. Okay, thank you. I'm working tomorrow and I work from [TIME] to [TIME], but I'm pretty sure. What time do you usually get off tomorrow? I'm off at [TIME], but. And then on Monday, we're open, it's service is closed. But Monday were [TIME] to [TIME] to [TIME] normal hours. Yeah, because that's Friday, Saturday. What's that? I said my [DURATION] off for Friday, Saturday. Right. What do you. Well, you know, keep in mind. When's your lease up on this? I gotta make my payment. I was trying to hold out. Right. No, I don't blame you. I just. Let me do this real quick. Let me see if I can get a hold of. If I can break in there because we're busy. Let me see. Because we can also. Actually, FYI, we can do this [ORGANIZATION]. You don't have to come in. Well, I want to get the warranty. I think on it too. That was another thing I had asked people that we were discussing. Right. What the bumper to bumper? Yeah, the warranty. Since you're buying it and you're going to be out of factory warranty is not a bad thing. You know normally on new cars, on a new car you don't need it. But on if you're buying yours and you're making payments on it, you definitely want in case the AC moves out, the regulator, whatever. But [ORGANIZATION] is the one that offers that. Let me do this. Let me see if I can get with [PERSON_NAME] and find out if what you know what the numbers are on it. Right. And I'll call you, I'll call you back. We can do. On a warranty. What kind of warranty do you want? That way I can get a price for you. How long did you want to [ORGANIZATION] this for too? I wanted the cheapest payment as possible. Okay. So we can go out [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION]. Which is. I'm not really. Yeah, I'm not really wanting to do that but. Well, it's the cheapest payment, you know and you know what down the road when the, you know, when things turn around. But he. You know, I'm sorry about the guy you spoke to earlier. He came to me and was telling me and I read your email. But you're. Are you going to get your own. You're going to get your own money? Because I can't. I can't get nowhere close [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I know. And I decided that if I was going to buy the warranty, I had to go through you guys. Right? You got. Yeah, you don't want to buy an aftermarket warranty. And our warranty is through [ORGANIZATION]. It's called security plus. So yeah, it's through [ORGANIZATION] at any [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] across, you know from here to [LOCATION] is definitely a way to Go. You want me to go to a different [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION], then? No, no, no, I'm saying. No, I'm saying the warranty. You can go to any [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] to get the car service when you buy the factory, when you buy an aftermarket, extended warranty, you have to go to, like, particular shops. And it's just. And you're not saving that much money. I mean, let me get them to get you a price and a payment and I'll get you some numbers. Are you putting anything down or you just want to [ORGANIZATION] the whole thing? Just [ORGANIZATION] the whole thing. And what rate can you get at your bank? Because he was saying something. You were getting [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Because we don't have any. I know, but the thing is, is that I get it and I understand that, but if I go through them, I'm probably not going to be able to get my warranty. Right? Is that how that works, or. No, no, I mean, it's on the buyer's order. You can get it. You can get the, you know, warranty included in the bottom line and then just bring us a check from your credit union or whoever's giving you that [MONEY_AMOUNT]. No, I was shopping for rates online. Okay. And it said that they could do a used car for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And that was a special they had, like, [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Who knows what it is now? Right. Okay. Because I put in the information for the car. I put in how much I needed, and then it said based on my credit score, they can give it to me for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But then I was like, I got busy and I didn't have a chance to get all my stuff together. So I can't do it, like, right now. Now my daughter's getting out of school. Now I can take care of it. So I was just gonna come to you guys and just do it and get it out of the way. Well, let me do this real quick. Let me. Yeah, let me get. Let me get some numbers. I'll get an extended warranty in there. I'll get it with zero down, and I'll let you know what numbers are. And if you're good with it, then I can probably get everything printed up to where you come in. And you don't have to go through [ORGANIZATION] or nothing like that. You can just see me and only take [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Right? That's what I was hoping we could do. So, yeah, let me see what I can do. Forget about me. No, no, I'm not, sweetie. I'll never forget about You? Yeah. That guy today was so nasty to me on the phone. Oh, my God. I couldn't believe how he was talking to me today. It was bad. I was explaining why I haven't had a chance to come in. He hung up on me mid conversation. Because I said I only deal with you. Yeah, that's pretty rare. It was really bad. I called and complained to [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, quick question. Do you have an insurance card in front of you? I just want to make sure I got the right bin. Okay, hold on a second. I can definitely get that. I mean, I'm not going to get a lease any cheaper, right? No, very expensive right now. Yeah, just a rogue SV lease I got. I just did one for a customer and it was [MONEY_AMOUNT] with [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down. If you don't put the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down, it raises it $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per thousand. So it'd be like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. How many miles on your road? Last time you said it was like 22,800. Roughly. We can use right now, as I look at it, it's 23,283. 23,283. Okay, perfect. Okay, hold on a second. I'm used to this. I'm sure. You know what? I'm sure this is it because it's only 20 [ORGANIZATION]. You ready? Yeah. All I need is the last four. It's [VEHICLE_ID]. Perfect.

I'm interested in the [ORGANIZATION] Ridgeline and like to talk to a [OCCUPATION]. Okay, let me transfer you to one. Were you already working with someone or did you need anyone available?

Yeah, I'm interested in a [ORGANIZATION] Ridgeline rtle. Oh, awesome. Yeah, I got plenty of those. Did you have a color in particular that you were looking for or. Yeah, yeah, No, I don't know if it's possible. A lunar silver. And you said rtle, Right, rtle. So I've got the meteorite gray. I got red, white, blue. We got this color color. It's like pewter. And then I've got black. It looks like the one silver or the. All the silvers I have are RTLs. So. But I do have eight on the RTLE. But if you had a secondary color, where would you go with that? It would be blue. It would be blue, yeah. Okay. Yeah, so I do have a blue one available that's in stock available. Is that something that you'd like to take a look at today? Yeah. Well, instead of today, just to save time, I was hoping to see the final value, the final dot. Because I'm not. I'm not planning to use any finance, any loan company. It's just going to be me and you or the dealership to close out the deal. Take that cash. Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm gonna write a check and just check it out. Okay. Let me. Let me see what I can come up with. A lot of the times, dealerships that we have kind of like a policy. A lot of the times they don't like us to get the final dot price without the customer here, without like the full information. But what I can do is I can get you a. It won't be spot on, but it's to be very close to it. Let me see if I can. Because I've. Let me see what I can find for you. Let me see if I can do the math. Yeah, just. Yeah, just a spare. Just like an estimated. Yeah, I. I knew. I know. It's just. It's just that what's what's said over the phone. Unfortunately, if it's not on paper, it doesn't count. Even, Even with your. Your good intentions, it just doesn't count. So two dealerships sent me quotes. They sent me through my email their PDF file of the final with the title, sales tax, everything at the end. They did that. Okay. So. Because in fact one of them said that they just sold one of the rtle to a customer for early [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] special. And it's the exact same model, same color, same everything. And he basically just took that and just, just put it on his attached file and just send it to my email. Okay. Yeah, let me, Let me see if I can talk to my management and see what I can come up with real quick and I'll see you. Let me. Is it okay if I got your number real quick just so if anything I could send you a text message. I'm gonna put you on hold. I'm gonna ask him real fast. No, go ahead, go ahead. Just. Just go. Just go ask him. If there's no. If we can't get anything on paper, there's plenty of places I can go to and it doesn't matter. We. I can go somewhere else. And so we let. Yeah, yeah. No, no, no. I want to make sure that we can get you what you're looking for. That's. That's my, that's my main goal. So let me go. Let me talk to my management real quick. We're doing. I just want to. Just real quick. We're doing. The price of the vehicle is going to be MSRP, so it's at $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then it would be just +TTNL. You're also getting our tent all season, weather mats, wheel locks, cargo trunk tray. And you get our [DURATION] [DURATION] blue steel, which is a paint and fabric. It's our paint and fabric protection warranty. So it's [DURATION] [DURATION] unlimited. [PERSON_NAME], I just wanted you to know what's included in the price of our vehicle. And then let me go see if I can. Can get a price quote for you. Okay. Yeah. Okay, Just hold them for one. It's It. All right, you there? I grabbed my cell phone, not the desk phone. Sorry. As you can tell, it's been a long day. But anyway, so I got a price quote from you. So it's going to be at [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. With the tax, title, licensing fee. So. Yeah, so that's. I can't. I'll see if I can get you A paper one. And I can send you, like, a picture of it. Sure. But yeah, as far as that. Did you write that down? Oh, I'd rather just go ahead and just take it down on a. On a file or on writing. I'll just go ahead and just take that. Okay. Yeah. All right. So the only thing is I just need your number real quick. Sure. And I could send you over basically an estimated price for you. Sure, sure. Number [PHONE_NUMBER]. Go ahead. Go ahead. Sorry. [PHONE_NUMBER]. All right, cool. [PERSON_NAME]. And you said [PHONE_NUMBER], right? Area code. Yeah. Okay. All right, yeah, I'll. I'll send over. I'll see if I can get it on paper, but I don't know. Have you done business with [ORGANIZATION] before? No. No. So here at [ORGANIZATION], we. We just do a one simple price. So whenever we give a price and it doesn't change, so we don't change our prices. We just do one simple price. And it just negates all of the hatchling and haggling that, you know, the negotiating brings and just makes it a lot simpler process. It makes it a lot quicker here at the dealership, too, because we just put the price out in front. So, yeah, let me see if I can get you a paper one. But as far as. As far as our price and everything, it's not going to change. So we don't change it. It doesn't matter if it's in writing or not. We don't change our prices. So. But yeah, I'll see what I can do.

I can apply tomorrow for my jeep at [TIME] and I was just calling to see if there was anything that opened up for today. I'll be happy to check that one for you. [PERSON_NAME]. Can I have your phone number associated on your account? Yes. Okay, thank you so much. Just a second. So it's. I'm only seeing the [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Town and Country for [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], is this A1? What do you see? It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Town and Country. No, I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Renegade. Let me check that here. Just a second. Unless you put the wrong car in. I mean, that's definitely possible, I suppose. Let me see. Ma' am, just a second. Is it scheduled for a basic service maintenance or just a diagnostic? It would be a diagnostic. Yeah, if she put it under, I think it'd be a diagnostic. It's just some weird noise that my car is making. So I don't know what she entered it as. But I should be the only [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I mean, my name's not very common, so I don't know what you're seeing, but it's supposed to be set for tomorrow at [TIME] for a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Renegade. The one that I have here is a [ORGANIZATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION]. Tomorrow, [DATE] [DATE], at [TIME] okay, so that was a diagnostic of the noise. Okay, so she just put in the wrong vehicle. So can you change that? I don't have a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Whatever. You said [ORGANIZATION]. I don't have a [ORGANIZATION]. Can I have. I don't know if you got that. I'm sorry to hear. Ma' am, can I have the. The VIN number of the [ORGANIZATION] Renegade? Yeah, let me go outside of my car and get that for you. Hold on. Because I'd given it to her, so that's super weird. It makes me wonder if she heard the letter wrong or something like that. Let's see, what digits do you need for the VIN number? I need to have the whole VIN Number, Ma' am, You want the whole thing? Okay, so it is [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID].

In here, let me just change. [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Renegade. Yes, that would be it. Okay, let me check if we have availability for today. Okay, we don't have anything for today, ma' am. We can just schedule this tomorrow at [TIME]. Yeah, I'll just have to leave it as is. What do you think the likelihood would be of me getting the vehicle back tomorrow? Do you think that. Oh, no, I couldn't be able to provide any given earlier appointment available for tomorrow. Tomorrow? It. No, it's already on a full shop capacity. Okay. There's no other time, like at [TIME] or [TIME] Nothing like that? That's right. Yes, ma' am. Okay. Okay, so let's just leave it as is then. We'll just. I'll just bring it tomorrow at [TIME] okay. All right. And what time will you write? What time are you open? The [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is open until [TIME] [TIME] okay, so that would give them potentially [DURATION] [DURATION] to look at it, give or take. Your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] would let you know the better time estimate once you come in for service. That depends on the issue of the vehicle as well, [PERSON_NAME]. Right. Okay. They. They don't ever just like take the vehicle and then if they have the availability, just plug it in on the spot, do they? They just kind of take it, you leave and they'll just call you and contact you? That's correct, yes, ma' am. Okay. All right, well, thank you so much, [PERSON_NAME].

"Calling her name is for [ORGANIZATION]. How can we assist you? Yeah, I'm trying to get hold. I don't know, there's a [PERSON_NAME] and [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] or something like that. No, we don't have a. Can you look me up. Can you look me up by my phone number or emails? This guy's called me three times. I want to get back to him. Looks like an [PERSON_NAME] about right. I don't know. That's why I'm asking you. But if you picked up some name. I guess. Yeah. When I put in your telephone number it pops up. A gentleman named [PERSON_NAME]. He's in our. He's in our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, that's the guy. He's been trying to get me to come in. Okay, give me [TIME] second. Let me see if it exit. Is that sir. Okay. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME] speaking. Hey [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I think you called me a couple times. I was looking at a four. I thought 150, but I'm kind of. I'm interested in your [DATE_INTERVAL]. Did you have [TIME] or something used? Give me. Give me [TIME] second. Let me pull you up in the system here. I remember the name. I just remember. I don't remember the exact truck we were talking about and I. For some reason I thought it was an F150 but I couldn't. Whatever, you're no problem at all. Yeah, so get this [DATE_INTERVAL] lariat used. I think it's a [DATE_INTERVAL] or [DATE_INTERVAL] [TIME] owner or something. Are you able to pull that up if I want to ask some questions. Questions about it? Are you referring to the. I'm sorry, the blue [DATE_INTERVAL] Lariat Tremor. You have more than [TIME] [DATE_INTERVAL]. I guess I'm interested in all of them. No, no, no. I'm trying to make sure we're talking about the same truck. So is that the vehicle you're looking at? I haven't quite pulled you up in the system and I'm just trying to get logged in here. So is that the truck you're asking about? The blue F250? That's [TIME] of them. I'm interested in all your 250s. Gotcha. I don't know how many I have but I can do a different type of search, so. But you are looking for pre owned, is that correct? Most likely, yeah. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Yeah, they're hard to come by, new or used so but let me just do the search again because I'm very familiar with the blue [TIME]. I've got someone else I'm talking to about it right now. That's a beautiful truck inside and out. So I know that [TIME] quite well because I just went and put my hands on it. But let me see if we have any others that might be available or coming soon. All right, thanks. Of course. Of course. I'm just going to look for super duties. Yeah, I like super duty. I don't want to go 350 though I have for my needs. That is the only pre owned [DATE_INTERVAL] I have. All right. All right, so tell me about it. That engine, I wasn't sure if that was that gas or diesel. Give me [TIME] second. Let me just pull this up. So we're looking at it together. Give me [TIME] second. My computer is just a little bit slow here. Okay. I thought you said you're all familiar with it, but sort of familiar. Yep, yep. I just. If you're going to ask any questions, I just want to make sure I give you the right information. Yep, that's good. No worries. Yeah, so that's okay. All right. Thank you for your patience there. Okay, so the 7.3 liter V8, the truck's got 20,490 miles on it. And I also have diesel or gas. It's gas. All right. Do you know the torque rating on it and the horsepower? I know the horsepower is 385. The torque I'd have to look into for you. Okay, well I want to know the torque and I want to know actually that specific vehicle. What's its tow? Tow capacity? Okay, I can look at that for you. So token tow capacity and torque I'll make. I'm going to make a note here and I can get back to you with that. Okay. And then I think it's four wheel drive. The moonroof, I think. Or it does not have the moonroof? No, it's got a spray and bed liner but no moonroof. What about. Does it have heated seats or steering wheel or anything? Yes, it's got all that. It's the lighter color beige interior. They refer to it as medium light camel. All right. What about blocked heated steering wheel? Yes, it does have the heated steering wheel as well. And it's heated and vented. Blind spot for the mirror. Yes, it would have that. It's the larger trailer. Tow mirrors with the power. But yeah, we'll have the blind spot in there too. All right. What about adaptive cruise control? Ooh, it should have it because the lariat. Yeah, I'll double check. But it should have that as part of the package. Yeah. I don't know which [TIME]. I've been looking at some platinums, but adaptive cruise control. What about lane monitor? You know, what keeps you in the lane beyond the blind spot. I think that's all that they had on that year. So just forgive me, forgive me. Lane centering. But it wouldn't have. There's a newer version of that, but it's got lane centering, the blind spot monitor. It should have adaptive cruise control. If that's all part of the same package, it should have all those. Some of the trailers have some pretty fancy trailer hitch mirror. When you're backing up, it's like, wow, you can really see it right at the ball. Does that have [TIME] of those fancy mirrors? You know, and talk about cameras is better word than mirror. Forgive me, are you referring to the camera or the mirror? Yeah, the camera. Sorry about that. You know, it's a camera that focuses right on the trailer. I've got to check on that. I'm not familiar with whether or not it has that. Okay, what about. Well, of course it has all towing package and I don't know if it's a max package, but it has a full towing package, right? Yes, it does. Yeah. Okay. I'm trying to think what else I care about. Well, it's a crew cab. I should have to end right off the bat, right? Yeah, the crew cab and then the axles, the 3.73 axle ratio. So that's what I'm going to plug in with the engine to get you the. The towing capacity. All right, that's sweet. And then how big. How long is that bed? The bed is six and a half. Perfect. Perfect. Okay. Well, you know, checking a lot of boxes, I'm towing capacity. And then what was the other thing I was going to ask you about? You asked the two questions I got to get back to you on is tow capacity and torque. All right. And what do you. What do you have to. For that guy? Okay, so the asking on the vehicle is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You guys have those, did you? I don't know if you have access to the old sticker. Like what would that thing cost originally or I was actually looking for it. I don't, I don't have it. I don't know. Oh, actually no, forgive me. I do have it. Oh yeah, the MSRP at time MSRP was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Well, almost the same. Same as it was. Okay, so. Well, I know a new [TIME] probably. So it was how much again, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The asking price on the vehicle is [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right, all right. So I got a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Transit that I bought it at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. They'll buy it for me at a certain price. I don't know if it's worth asking your guys too. I don't know. All wheel drive [ORGANIZATION] Transit 3.5 EcoBoost. Maybe I'll talk to you guys too, anyway. Yeah, I know, I know. My [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] would love to. Love to take a look at it and put a number on it. Definitely. Definitely something we can use. All right. Okay. I guess get back to those two things. Do you have any new ones? The 250s. Not. Not that. Not at that level. I've got a. The highest trim I have is an XLT, a [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] XLT, but nothing above that. Yeah. What's the XLT? How much is that going for? It's 4x4. It is a 4x4. I'd have to look into it for you. I can pull it up here in a minute. It's a black on black, gray interior, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I've got a discount on it right now, but the MSRP is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What do you mean you got a discount? You got something below that? Yeah. So we're still honoring all the [EVENT] [EVENT] sales. I've got a discount of $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. I don't know if it will carry over, but it brings the price right now down to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right, what does it have on there on XLT? I mean, the crew cab is. How long has it been? I'm sorry? It is a crew cab. It's going to be the same bed as the other F250 from the outside. I mean, it doesn't have the tremor package. It. It's a regular screen. So if you're looking at these newer trucks, you do have the option for the larger. The newer infotainment system. It does not have that. This [TIME] got any power seats or leather seats or any of that. Give me a second here. Yeah, Sorry about all that. Yeah, no problem. Okay. No bed liner on it. That's always easy to take care of. But it doesn't have it right now. It is a column shift. What the column shift mean? The gear shift is right behind the steering wheel. Oh, bot. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cloth interior. Give me a second. I'm just kind of looking. Probably not heated seats or anything. No, no, it doesn't have. Does not have heated seats. What kind of Engine. Give me [TIME] second. So it does have. It does have the. The seat is. The base of it is power. So it's got the base and then the lumbar is power. It's not. It's not full power. So it's not. It's not a power recliner. Okay. I guess. What do you mean? That. Would it go forward and back or forward and back and up and down? Forward, back and up and down? Forward, back, up and down. Doesn't have the. Yeah, it doesn't have the backrest. It's not power. That's manual. Yeah. And that. That's a Diesel. That's a 6.7 diesel. Oh, that's a diesel. That's nice. Those diesels, huh? You call it. Well, yeah. Okay, so it's a really nice engine. Not as much of the fancy stuff inside. Yeah, it must tow a lot. Gray and cheer by four. Yes, it is 4x4. So in terms of a tower, that's a good [TIME]. All right. That [TIME] how much the MSRP is.7685. So I guess it's whatever that is. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] Moral [EVENT] kind of thing. Okay. All right. Well, let me think about it. Why don't you get back to me? Well, can you tell me what the towing on the diesel [TIME] is? I mean, it's gotta be huge. I'll be honest. All of these, I never like to just. I gotta. I gotta look it up. Because if you're gonna get real particular, I want to make sure I'm quoting correctly for the axle and the engine. Yeah, no, I mean, they're all in that. They're all in that same category. They're all up there. But. But I just. If you want an exact number. I don't want to. I gotta. I gotta source it out of a book. Yeah. So. Yeah, why don't you do that? And then [TIME] other question was, since you have the sticker on that used [TIME], what does it say for gas mileage? You know, the sticker. Give me a minute here. Oh, none of. None of these. Will have them. None of these super duties quote anything for gas mileage. Oh, all right. Yeah. I'm wondering, anything above an F150. They don't. They don't. They don't post anything. Yeah, they don't have to, I guess. Okay. Well, yeah, it's all a matter of what you're doing. It's matter, you know, matter what you're doing, what you're towing, payload where you're driving. But yeah, they don't. They don't post any of those numbers. They're both like. They're both. What's the word I want to say? Super duties. Right. I'm sorry. They're both what's called super duty. Is that correct? Yes, they're all generally referred to as super duties for whether it's a [DATE_INTERVAL] or a 350. They're referred to as Super Duty. They're both F250 Crew Cab 4x4 with the same bed. The biggest difference would be the gas versus the diesel. And then obviously the trim level, though. The blue [TIME] being a lariat tremor package. So the lariat package for trim and then the tremor off road package. And this [TIME] is just an xlt. Yeah. Yeah. All right, well, I'm gonna think about those pretty good. I do something. I'm gonna do it today, actually. I'm going to [LOCATION], so I kind of wanted to go tonight. I got this big trailer on my van right now as I'm speaking. So it'll either be fast. I'll be honest. I've got. This is the last day of the [DURATION]. This is a very, very busy day for the store. I don't know how quickly I'll be able to get back to your questions. I've got. I've got two appointments on trucks right now, including, I'll be honest, I do have an appointment on the blue F250. So what do you got on the blue F250? I have an appointment on it. There's someone coming in in the next [DURATION] to look at it. If you want to. I would encourage you just to come down here. I do not want you to wait for me to get back to you with your. With the questions. It's the last day of the [DURATION] and we are just bombarded with calls. Everyone's coming in, trying to take advantage of this last minute savings. So if you want to do something, it would be a great day to come in. All right, so on this blue [TIME], is it pretty much that guy got first dibs, and then if he doesn't want it, then I can. No, not at all. No [TIME] got first dibs until there's a signed contract. I can't hold it or reserve it. Someone can come in right now and it's a done deal. And the guy that shows up last or thinks about it too long, it's always first come, first serve. They don't play any favorites. Yeah. All right. Okay. Well, what about that [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] guy? Can you press, you know. Well, I mean, if I wanted to buy it today, you can get me in and out of there. Somebody will help me with the paperwork, right? No, no, definitely. What I'm saying is, is I. If, if you're, if you're thinking about doing it. Come on in. Come on in. Look at it. Look at them both. We'll get everything going. It just right now, I. I can't. I. I can't get a number on your trade. And I. And I just. I don't want to be upset if I don't get back to you with the, with the question on the torque. Yeah, it's just. It's just. Okay, can you transmit to the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] guy who could give me a number on the trade or talk. I can talk to about it? I honestly, it's. He's going to want to see it. That's. That's what we're going to do right now. We're going to. We're going to need to see it to give you a fair number. All right. Well, I already got a number, but anyway. All right. The other guys gave me number. You're in an advantage. You got it. You got a number for us to beat. But I'd like you to come in and see the trucks and make sure. Make sure you like the trucks. Yeah. No point appraising your trade if you don't want [TIME] of the trucks. All right, fair enough. That's all good. I'm on board with you. Okay. All right, [PERSON_NAME], thank you. Any idea what time you want to come in? I don't know. I got to think about this a little bit. But anyway, do you want me to call you if I come in or you want me to just show up? I mean, if you can call me, it'd be great. I'm going to do this. I'm going to set an appointment for you just so we can hopefully be expecting you. And if I'm tied up with somebody else, I'll make sure you're in the best of hands with whoever helps you out. Okay, here's the deal. I'm up in [LOCATION] picking up a motorcycle. Let's see. I'm too sort of. Yeah, I could probably be down there on [TIME] or so. Do you have a mobile number, text or something? I certainly do. I just have to go through the main line. No, no, no. Text me my. I'm driving. Can you text me your. Text me and then I'll have your mobile number. You got it. I'll send it over to you right now. The number that I'm gonna. I'm gonna text you. Yeah, that's correct. Yeah. Thanks, [PERSON_NAME]. You got it. Talk to you soon. All right, Bye. Thank you. Bye.",success,feature_question,F250,high,True,03fca7433453409982ee017169ff169c_transcript.json
"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for [OCCUPATION]. Okay, give me one second, please. You can find us online@toyotaofdowntownla.com. thank you for holding. We'll be right with you. Gracias. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], por favor. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] speaking. How can I help you? Thank you. Hey, [PERSON_NAME], how you doing? This is calling inquiry about a vehicle. See if you guys might have one. What is it that you're looking for, sir? Looking for a Camry hybrid XSE with the red interior. Camry. Okay, let me see, let me see. Let me see if I got one of those coming. That would be [MONEY_AMOUNT] with red. I have one incoming that's available. I have a total of three. Two gray ones and one called Ice Edge with red interiors. Two, two have been sold already. I've got one available. What's out the door? One of those puppies. Well, I'll be up front with you, [PERSON_NAME]. These guys are selling because it's a hybrid. We do have market adjustments or what they call markups on them. Normally we ask [MONEY_AMOUNT] in store, but on this one, I could probably do about [MONEY_AMOUNT] for you over the MSRP. I'm not familiar with the MSRP. Just, you know. Well, this one did I have coming. MSRP is [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] because it does have a couple of options on it. This one does have the moonroof. Also has what's called the cold weather package. It's basically, I believe, on. On the xsc, a heated steering wheel as XSE already comes with a lot of stuff on it. So you would be, let me see here. Just a rough estimate. You would be looking at, let me see, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You'd be looking at out the door, just under [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Less than I expected. So I know this one hassle, extra stuff. Not for me. It's for the old lady. I really, you know, I stick to. Is there any way that I could get like [PERSON_NAME], because she is dead set on that red interior. We've been going back and forth about. You get a hybrid base model, it's constantly cheaper, but she wants the red interior. And the red interior you can only get on an xse. You can't get that on any other trim, less expensive SE models. But you can't get a red interior on unless you do it aftermarket. Yeah, no, yeah, I understand. Trust me. I'm trying to explain that to this lady, you know, So I know this one has all these Extra packages and stuff. Is there any way that the, you know, just the baseline model XSE filled with that red interior with no extra add ons, no packages and whatnot would be under that [MONEY_AMOUNT]? No. No. Yeah. I mean I have one on order. It's not built yet. It's the same, it's an ice edge color with the red interior, but it's only like a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] cheaper. And it doesn't, does not have the moonroof, doesn't have the cold weather package, basically. I mean your base XSE hybrid, red interior, ice edge color exterior. And Ice edge is not a premium color, so they don't charge you any extra for the paint. Unlike let's say the windchill pearl or ruby flare Pearl. Those are $[MONEY_AMOUNT] additional charge for premium paint. But this is only $[MONEY_AMOUNT] cheaper. It's [MONEY_AMOUNT] compared to the one that's coming is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What if we're talking about the non hybrid model, how much would the price change in that case? I don't have any [PHONE_NUMBER] cylinder ones. I don't think coming with a red interior, red interior is very hard to get. I don't have any basic XSE's. All I have are V6s and they come standard with a lot of features and those are around. MSRP is like [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, forget about the red interior for a second. I'm just trying to give her, I'm trying to get all the options there because my budget is [MONEY_AMOUNT] at the maximum. And I know I'm not getting the hybrid for that just because I've been for RAV4 hybrid and geez, because the gas prices, they're just uber inflated. What are we talking about? Just a regular xfp dark color, no, you know, no special, I guess packages or red interior. How much would that run yet? And if you haven't, don't build it or. Well, I have one on order actually. I mean this one's not too much more. It's a windshield pearl. It's a pearl white with a black leather interior. Black softex. Nothing. It just has a couple of accessories. MSRP is [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. We do ask a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] markup on gas models. I might be able to work with you a little bit, but let's say I can get it to you for like [MONEY_AMOUNT] + tax and license. You might be right there around like [MONEY_AMOUNT] or just over [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. All right, we can Work with that. Do you have any pictures available that you can email me so I can try to persuade this lady to go for anything other than the rest? Yeah, I mean, I can send you maybe some stock photos. You might be able to see this one on our website. Okay, let me pull it up real quick. And again, the computer. [LOCATION]. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] vehicle. This is just a regular Camry, right? Yeah, Camry gas xse. It's in a windchill pearl. Last eight of the vintage. You can do search. If I click on the search bar on your website, it'll pull up the. Put in the vin, will pull up the vehicle. It should. Okay, so P under new vehicles. Yeah, it should. If you're in the new section. Last eight of the VIN is [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. You like umbrella? [VEHICLE_ID]. What was the color? Sorry again. It's windchill pearl. So it's a pearl white. Oh, there it is. Okay, this is nice. You said she wants a dark color. Yeah, but I mean, I prefer white. My camera is white. Well, there's a silver one. Well, the thing is, I recommended this white one because it's already in transit to the dealership. It's already coming. Okay. May get here by [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. Now, there's a silver one that hasn't been built yet, but it's going to get built [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL], but it's a silver one. And then there's one that's going to cost a little more because it's midnight black with black interior and it's got a panoramic moonroof, so it's a little bit more expensive. Yeah, I love the moonroof, but the silver one has less accessories and they don't charge you premium paint. So it's exactly $[MONEY_AMOUNT], you know, $[MONEY_AMOUNT] less. Right. Okay. I'm sorry, I'm reading. You know, no worries. What was your name again? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. So, [PERSON_NAME], let me ask you, I mean, you're finding a car for, I guess, a customer of yours. Are you a [OCCUPATION]? No, no, no, no. This is random. No, no, this is still personal. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay, no problem. I mean, I can see the appeal of the xse, but it's just way out of. Do you have a direct number where I can contact you? Yes, of course. You know, that way I can just reach out to you. I know this is not what. So maybe just to see what else you might be interested in. Okay, like we both know I'm very well aware of the whole situation. With cars. And it's just impossible to find anything below that for what you want. Yeah. If you're ready, my direct number here, [PERSON_NAME], is [PHONE_NUMBER]. All right. And your name was again? Sorry. [PERSON_NAME]. Right? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, interesting. Yeah. All right. It's like gin and juice. Yeah, just like shit and juice. Okay, [PERSON_NAME]. All right, so I think one of my. Well, regardless, I'll send you my info. Cool. Would you mind if we change email? I mean, I'm in front of a screen [DURATION] [DURATION], so emailing would probably just be better. No problem. No problem. Sounds good. Sounds good. Oh, you know what, before we go, just off the top, it does have to be exact. What's a regular base model Camry hybrid SE out the door, you know, just from what you. Well, that might fit a little better into your budget. Yeah, I might be able to. Might be able to work the markup a little bit better for you on one of those and might be able to get it in right in around that $[MONEY_AMOUNT] budget. But it's not going to have that red interior. But if we're lucky, if we can get one. Yeah, I mean, hopefully we can get one for you. I see this one, it's already sold, but let's just say. Oh, this one even has a weather package too. But the MSRP is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right. So even, let's say if I can get it to you around [MONEY_AMOUNT], you might still be right around, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT] to $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for a brand new Camry Hybrid SE. So without the weather package and whatnot, I mean, you might be right around, you know, we might be able to get it just around [MONEY_AMOUNT]. If we can get you a base. Base. Base one. But the way the factory is right now, [PERSON_NAME], I mean, they can't produce enough vehicles. So whatever they can produce, they're putting in whatever they can options or accessory wise. So that's why it's really hard to find base models. And I don't know if you tried. Not that you're looking, but I don't know if you tried looking for the Camry hybrid le, which is a very base model of Camry hybrids. They're not making any. Oh, they're not making any. That's interesting. Well, it is in their model lineup, but it's not worth it for them to make it. So whatever they can produce. Exactly, exactly. So like you said, you were kind of looking for like the RAV4 hybrids. I'm sure you couldn't find any Les or hardly any XLEs. Everything's going to be XLE premiums or the Xses. And those are all like, you know, already [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT] MSRP. So that's all that's out there. I mean, that's whatever they're making. They're trying to maximize on getting all these accessories and options in there. So all you're going to find is the higher end ones. Yeah, sounds fun. Like I said, I'll talk to her, try to get it. If she's interested in any one of these lower models. Is this your cell phone number, [PERSON_NAME]? Yeah, this is my cell phone number, if you don't mind. You know what to stay in contact with me just in case I'm not at my desk. I'm going to text you my business card from my cell phone. Okay, outstanding. Awesome. So I'll send that over to you and then I'll send you an email with my info. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, not a problem. Have a good one. Alrighty. Alright, bye.

For pre owned sales, press [PHONE_NUMBER]. For thanks for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON_NAME] speaking. How can I help you? How you doing, Mr. [PERSON_NAME]? Hey, how you doing? My mom bought a car back at. Back about [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Yes. And she passed away. Her name was [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And I still have the car, but I was considering my father, man, he catches the bus. He's [PERSON_AGE]. He's a good man. I have a truck, but I'm waiting on a settlement to come. Then I'm gonna buy me another used truck because I have a landscaping business. Plus I work at [PERSON_NAME]. But it's still good to have a backup. Another vehicle. Yeah, but, but, but the [ORGANIZATION], I was considering that I want to let my father use it. Lives on [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. But where can I get a tracking advice? Advice? Because my father lives in a. It's a good area, but [ORGANIZATION] a. One of those type of cars where people target. You know what I mean? Yeah, like a low jack system. Right. Because, you know, my father, man, he old school. He don't like to have a telephone or nothing, you know, And I. And I don't. I don't want him to drive the car, but, you know, I just. He just don't have a phone or nothing. I can't reach him or nothing, you know, and that's the thing. I. You know, and I want to have. And. And I want to make sure that car is occurring. That if anything do go down. But, you know, I believe that it won't. But still, it's better to be safe than sorry. That at least I know if something goes down, they know where to trace the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. A car is. Yeah, we. We have lojacked. We have an [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hold on. So let me see if I can get you over to somebody that can tell me something. How much. How much do something like that cost? Oh, you know, I don't know. It's probably, you know, actually I would be speculating. I don't know how much low track costs. Let me. Let me see if I can get you over somebody that can answer your question. Hold on a second. All right. And it looks good. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah. How you doing today, sir? I'm doing very well, thank you. Yourself. I'm blessed, man. I have a F150 truck, but my mom had bought a vehicle from there [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, but she Passed away. But I still had. I still had the vehicle and I'm paying payments on it. But my father, man, in [PERSON_AGE] and he's a real good guy. And I'm getting. I'm going to get a. I'm going to get a settlement, but I'm meeting on my. I'm going to get a settlement, but when I get that, I'm getting a truck, double truck because I cut lawns. Plus I work at [PERSON_NAME]. So I want to have another backup vehicle. But my father, man, he doesn't have a phone or nothing, man. And he lives on [LOCATION] [LOCATION] where he lives by the plaza. That's not really too much bad of an area. But at the same time it's near the city part area. So, you know, and I wonder. And he doesn't even have a phone. But I wanted to see if there's any easy possible way that I can get a tracking advice for that vehicle just in case if something do go down, I can trace where the car is. Okay, so we have. I have a young lady that I can. If I can get your name, I can have her call you tomorrow. She's not here. Well, we can install LoJack in the car. It's a one time fee. There's no monitoring fee for it. But after that you can track the car through an app to find out where the car is and everything. Well, you know what, man? I wish I would have got that with my mama's vehicle. I wish I did, man, because my mom, man, went into the wrong place in the city, man, and she never came home. I'm very sorry to hear that. She bought that vehicle there. And I don't know. And I, and I always, every night, I always, every now when I come in the evening, I always call, find out where she is. But this particular time, man, she knows. She said, I'm sitting in the house. I'm tired of sitting in the house. I just want to get out. So I didn't bother with her, you know, but, you know, and the night that I did that, I set my guard down. That's when something happened to her. And very, very, very sorry to hear that. If I had one of them low jack systems, man, I could have traced where she was and seen where she was and then probably did something about it. But how much does something like that cost that I. I'm not the person to talk to. As I said, we have an aftermarket young lady that does all that stuff, but she's not here right now. She will be in Tomorrow. What time is she in tomorrow? She's in from [TIME] to [TIME] tomorrow. So I can have her give you a call or if you want to give her a call, her name is [PERSON_NAME]. You can call the same number and just ask for [PERSON_NAME]. Or if you want to give me your name and number, I can have her give you a call tomorrow after [TIME]. Yeah, my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. My phone number is full on. I gotta rate. You said [PERSON_NAME]? Yes, sir. Okay, and the numbers. Great. Okay, I will get. I will pass that on to her, [PERSON_NAME], and she will give it. She's in, as I say, from [TIME] to [TIME] tomorrow. And I have her give you a call now. Something like that. Do they put it somewhere where it's unknown, where it can't be seen? Right? That is correct. You will not. They will not. They will not even tell you where it is. Okay, and then, and then connected to my phone. Yeah, there's an app that you can get off your phone and then you can track the car through your phone. Okay, I see where it is. It tell me the street and everything. Yes, sir. Well, listen, but I'm trying to figure something like that a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] or there's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What kind of number can you. I can. It's going to be under a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh, okay. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But I know, I know it's right around a [MONEY_AMOUNT], but I don't know the exact price. Oh, so. So you said it is about close to a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's around. I mean, it's not a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It might be right around a [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I don't. As I said, I don't know the exact price. She might be able to do. Do a special deal for you, but it's going to be. I mean, it's going to be somewhere between [MONEY_AMOUNT] to $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Right. Well, what I'm doing is get that information because my, my settlement money should be coming in and. And then that's when I get my settlement money. That's when I'm gonna get the used truck because I have F150 [DATE_INTERVAL], but I want to get something used, you know, for, for like something use. I could, you know, just give that a break, you know, I mean, because I got the Civic, you know, and the Civic, I'm gonna let my father use it. You know what I mean? But I just want to make sure it's up on the tracking device on it just case something go down. I can track that car. You know what I'm saying yes sir, definitely. Understand. So do you want me. Do you want to call us back once you have your settlement or do you want me to still have her give you a call tomorrow and you kind of try to try to figure it out? Still get. Yeah, she can give a call then I might work something I deal with or something. You know what I mean? Because that money said. I talked to my [OCCUPATION]. I should be getting the money soon. Okay. Yeah, I will give. As I say, she's in at [TIME] [TIME] tomorrow. She. So I will give her our pass along the message and she can reach out to you tomorrow. Right. Thank you very much. There no more. What's his name? He worked for used car dealership. He sold us the vehicle. But [PERSON_NAME] can die with the glasses. I. I don't. I don't know who you're referring to. Oh, okay. So I'm going to guess that they don't. I've only been here for [DURATION] [DURATION], so I don't know everybody that was here prior. But I will get [PERSON_NAME] to give you a call tomorrow. Sir.

I guess use is [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Explorer XLT, all wheel drive that I just saw on. Okay. I saw it on car. Yeah, thanks. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], new and pre owned. [PERSON_NAME] speaking, how can we help you? Hey [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm looking at one of the vehicles that you have at your site. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Explorer XLT, all wheel drive. I guess it's like space gray. Is that vehicle it shows on available? Still online. Is it still available there? Do you have a stock number for me? Yeah, one second. Where the hell. I'm trying to see where it would say it on there. Are you on our way? [PERSON_NAME], you still there? Yeah, I'm here. Sorry, it's. No, I just looked it up online. It said Cargurus. Cargurus got. Is this a new or a pre owned? It's a pre owned. Oh, well, it says pre owned. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. It's got 3000 miles on it. I'm trying to see if I can get to 3,000 miles. It's space. Let me see if I can just narrow it down. Sorry, man. No, it's all right. [DATE_INTERVAL] [PHONE_NUMBER]. Do you look. Do you see a VIN number anywhere on there you can make the last day of the VIN or anything like that. That's what. Oh, there we go. Last four of the VIN is [VEHICLE_ID]. Give me the last [MONEY_AMOUNT], last three letters and then the numbers after of course. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay, let's take a peek. This one is. This one is sold. Oh, shit. Okay. Yes. Sorry, [PERSON_NAME], Is there another one you're interested in that you want me to take a peek at? Not at this time. That's the only one I saw. Do you guys have anything over there? Could you see what? Could you be able to tell me what you could do with the trade in without seeing it? Probably not. We. We're not doing a lot of site unseen Appraisals right now you would have to bring the vehicle, then we can take a peek at it. Okay. And then just see what you got over there. I'm looking for something similar. Like the XLT is fine with low miles, relatively newer, doesn't have to be brand new with a tow package. Is your car a [ORGANIZATION] that you're trading in? No, I got a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Cherokee, overland. Got it, Got it. Okay. Yeah, because I mean some [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] explorers, they have like incentivized financing on. If you take like a brand new one or like a demo one that we have, one that isn't pre owned, I mean, there's zero percent for [DURATION] [DURATION] on them too. So that's always a possibility. I mean, I don't know if that's something you might be doing or I don't know if you were going to pay cash or. No, I'd finance the rest. That's why I was kind of curious. I'm hoping to get over [DATE_INTERVAL] for the Jeep and then finance the rest if you guys have incentives. So if you do have zero percent interest for [DURATION] [DURATION], that'd be something. I'm interested. Because of the [DATE_INTERVAL] and newer or just the 2022s? Only the 2022s, because that's the last model year. So we still technically considered new. Like we have some demo vehicles that we had, you know, that people use for loaners and stuff like that. Yeah. So they're incentivized like that. So you can. So you can do [DURATION] [DURATION] at 0% on them. And then I've got five left. That gray that you're looking at, I think that was carbonized gray, right? Yeah, the color really doesn't. Carbonized gray would work. White, silver. My [MARITAL_STATUS] just said. Not blue or red. Not blue or red. Yeah, because [PERSON_NAME], I've got. I've got gray, white. I've got a few of them. I have some witness. I have some [DATE_INTERVAL] only 780 miles that you can get 0% for [DURATION] [DURATION] versus if you were to just take a pre owned one. You'd have to go with whatever interest rate a bank gives you. If you have approved credit. You can finance these through [ORGANIZATION]. Incentivize. [DURATION] [DURATION] of 0%. There's only a handful of them left around these lots because 2023s are pretty much all out and about right now. But I've got five demos left if that's something you'd be interested in. Yeah, I'm Interested in. Do you have a list that you could email me or. Hey, I could stop up there after work. Yeah. What, what time do you get off work? I could probably be. I could probably be over in your guys area around [TIME]. I'm up in [LOCATION] right now. That sounds good. You want to pop in and I can kind of go over every single one with you and how they all incentivize differently and everything and kind of just narrow it down with you? Yeah, yeah. You said your name was [PERSON_NAME]? My name's [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. You want to take my direct line down? Yeah, one second. Yeah, go ahead, [PERSON_NAME]. All right, perfect. I appreciate it, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, after work I'll head on over and I'll speak with you. Yeah, absolutely. These are the best bet right now. I mean, we have five or six left and these are literally like the best incentivized vehicles right now. If you're gonna go [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] anyway, you might as well get a brand new one and get the zero percent. Yeah. Or what? Yeah, that's. That's kind of what I'm thinking because the used cars, I was looking at [DATE_INTERVAL], 21, but they're not that much price. The price isn't that good. And you're on a. Have a 6 or 7% interest rate. That's if you have like a 800 plus credit score too. Like that's like considered a very good rate for a used car right now. Yeah, I do. I, I think my. I think it's like [MONEY_AMOUNT], but yeah, that's. So we should be good with that. I could be fucking wrong. I don't know. But last time I checked it was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. Like a used car with a couple thousand miles, the price is not like the same as a brand new one with zero miles. So it doesn't really make much sense. If you can get one of these, this would be your best bet. They're kind of a steal, honestly right now. Yeah, yeah. As long as you guys could do somewhat decent with the jeeps. I don't know if you guys are taking. Yeah, as long as you guys can do a good deal with trade ins, I'm. I'll be happy. All right, cool. Thanks, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, it's great. It's all paid off. Okay. Beautiful. Yeah, absolutely. And then you also get trade in tax credit too. So you know that first $[MONEY_AMOUNT], you know, you get 6% of it. So another [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] if you trade it in towards a new car. So something to keep in mind. I'm sorry. You said first nine. I'm sorry, what? I'll. I'll explain how tax credit works on Trade in, too, but, yeah, you can save more money if you trade in the car. There's. There's a lot of stuff that goes into it, but, yeah, no, you can save a bunch of money if you do one of these demos. And then, you know, we get. We'll do whatever we can on the new car to get you where you need to be, you know, with the old car and the new car together. All right, perfect. Thanks, man. All right, cool. I'll plan to meet you down here around [TIME]. Sounds good. See you then. Yeah. Bye. Yep, bye.",success,inventory_check,Explorer XLT,medium,True,040964ecc7d94e688f345d21618c25a0_transcript.json

Does [PERSON_NAME] still work there? He does, actually. Oh, great. You know, he was the best [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] I ever bought a car from. Oh, that's good to hear. Yeah. So I bought it there [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. I've loved it, but starting to think it might be a little bit impractical for just my daily commute, so thinking it might trade it in. Okay. Did you have some time to bring it on by and I can set you up to meet directly with [PERSON_NAME] again, maybe. So I actually, I live in [LOCATION] now, which is like a [DURATION] [DURATION] drive away. Okay. But there was a car I was thinking about buying from a friend in [LOCATION]. So that's why I went to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] website to look for. Look about, you know, look into selling it there. Sure. Did you know when that was going to take place? Or. I mean, I can certainly have one of our buyers take a look at yours just to see if they can get you a little bit more of an aggressive offer on. Would take place maybe in the next couple weeks, you know, maybe as early as this weekend or next week or, you know, sometime in [DATE_INTERVAL]. Sure. Did you just maybe shoot us a text and that way if you're in town, you can just bring it on by and we can take a look at it and see what offer we can make on it. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. It does also have a cap on it, an are cap. I don't know if y' all consider that for adding value with used cars or if you don't look at accessories, but other than that, it's been under warranty the whole time. Warranty is expiring In [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] year. So yeah, all maintenance done at pricely locations, that kind of thing. Yeah, that's fine. In terms of accessories and everything like that, I mean they do take that into account. Typically it's not ever going to show up on the book value of the vehicle. So they just see it and take an offer and kind of go from there. Cool, cool. So when I know that I'll be in town, just let you guys know and somebody will take a look at it. Yes, sir. Yeah, I shot you a text earlier. You can just respond to yes if you'd like. I'm one of the [OCCUPATION] here. And then once you decide to pop on in one, you can just kind of say hello to [PERSON_NAME] and then we'll have our buyers take a look at it and make an offer on it. And then real quick, before I commit to buying the car from a friend and drive out there, I just want to like verify that the offer that is shown on the website is like a solid floor. Right. Like I won't show up and get low balled if I drive out there [DURATION] [DURATION]. I mean, I don't believe so obviously you're coming from a distance. If you wanted to send me over some photos, I can at least just show it to them. As long as it's. We're pretty close, it's never too far off of it. Okay. Yeah, I didn't. I just did that real quick while I was getting in a oil change. So I didn't put the photos in. But it is in, you know, good condition. No accidents, mostly highway driving, all that. So. Cool. Yeah, I just didn't. I just wouldn't want to drive all the way out there and have someone tell me like, oh yeah, we can only come in [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] under that and then I'll be pretty, pretty annoyed. So. Yeah, no, I know. But like I said, feel free to shoot me. Shoot me some photos as well and I'll just take it to them just to verify. Awesome. Thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. No problem.",success,trade_in,unknown,medium,True,042283238ab34386b5070f9a12d415e6_transcript.json
"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. My name is [PERSON_NAME], how can I help you? Yes, sir, I just wondered how many miles are on that [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Edge SEL, the white one. Okay, gotcha. Give me one second. Who do I have the pleasure Speaking with? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. No wine. Let me just look it up real quick. Do you have, do you happen to have a stock number for it by any chance? Yeah, hold on. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. I'm sorry, what? Oh, [VEHICLE_ID]. Wait, hang on. You said it's an edge [DATE_INTERVAL], or [DATE_INTERVAL]? [DATE_INTERVAL]. All right, let's check it out. So that one's in Sister [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yeah, it's still pretty brand new. I can definitely right now it doesn't, doesn't show. You said [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. No, [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay, I found it. Let's check it out. So that one, what I can do, I can definitely go touch the vehicle right now to go ahead and find out exactly how many mouse it has. What's a good email for you? It's. Here's another one kind of tricky over the phone and I'm just going to go ahead and repeat about gotcha. All right, perfect stands for I was a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. So it's ptag. Gotcha. Perfect. All right, so let me go touch the vehicle. Let me go touch the vehicle right now real quick. Find out how many miles does he have? Were you going to go ahead and trade in a vehicle vehicle for it? I don't know yet. But also can you tell me what's left on the warranty? Because it says down here under yalls little fine prints that it would be the balance of the warranty and I need to know how much balance on the warranty is left. So basically whenever it says the balance of the warranty, so it is a new, it is a brand new vehicle. So for example, if you purchase it, let's say today, the warranty would actually start today. So so the vehicle, what it does is that the vehicle has [DURATION] [DURATION] or 36,000 miles that's going to be your bumper to bumper. So in any case that like the screen messes up or maybe the window is not going down or some type of, you know, you start hearing noises inside of the cabin that's completely covered for [DURATION] [DURATION] or the 36,000 miles and then you have [DURATION] [DURATION] or 60,000 miles for your powertrain. So your Engine and transmission are completely covered as long as you're doing the maintenance on the vehicle. And then you also have [DURATION] [DURATION] or 60,000 miles of your roadside assistance. So if you have it already with your insurance, great. But you're actually going to have it already through [ORGANIZATION] as well. And then on top of that, we actually give you, we'll give you about two free oil changes here at this dealership here at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. And then on top of that, [ORGANIZATION] gives you about 42,000 points, which are like reward points, which you can either use for extra oil changes or you can use them to go ahead and buy swag or maybe some floor mats for your vehicle. And that's completely up to you. So it definitely comes with a lot of benefits. So. Okay. Yeah, it sounds. So that wording on there is probably just for used vehicles. Exactly. Yeah. So like, even with our used vehicles, like we have, our vehicles have, like, if they're certified, they usually have like a warranty as well, like a small warranty, depending on how many miles they have. But you know, that's just basically with. With pre owned vehicles. Another thing that I was going to tell you that I was going to ask you. My bad, I'm so sorry. I'm going to go ahead and send you a video and everything like that just so you can go ahead and take a look at it. Do you have like anything that you want to go ahead and see of the vehicle? Like any questions? Concerns you thinking about coming out this weekend? I know that it's, you know, [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT], so Monday is definitely going to be busy. To be totally honest. To be totally honest, I've already been talking to somebody there. [PERSON_NAME], I think is his name. He keeps asking. Yeah, he keeps asking me that over and over and over again. And I can't con. Just on I can't come and for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] probably, so I don't. Gotcha. We'll still be here. Yeah, no problem. Thought I'd let you know that I don't know. No, no, no, you're. You're completely fine. I'm more than happy to go ahead and find that out for you. All right, so as I said, I'm gonna go touch the vehicle, find out exactly how many miles he has, take a quick video, and then we can definitely go ahead and go from there. That's all right for you? Okay. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. No problem. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.",success,inventory_check,Edge SEL,medium,False,0447b8d8bb4d4e60bcf38473c5cca926_transcript.json

"Hey. Thank you very much. Yes, ma' am. On [ORGANIZATION], I need to clarify something. I'm not exactly sure. My name is [PERSON_NAME] and I'm in the market for buying a nice used car on [ORGANIZATION]. It came up that they're like, right now this week, and I guess through tomorrow, Saturday, There is a repossession of cars that [ORGANIZATION] has gotten a hold of and that we might can sell our car and sell it and trade it in for another car. Am I making any sense with this? Is this something that's really going on or some. No, no, it's really going on. No, it's really going on. Did you want to talk to the [OCCUPATION] in that department? Sure do. Yeah. Thank you. All right. Thank you for calling. [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON_NAME] speaking. How can I help you? Yes, sir, I don't want to take up too much of your time, but I just saw [ORGANIZATION] and I. Yeah, the deal on [ORGANIZATION] in which the repossession of cars and selling and trading. So is that all something that's really, really true or just some fictitious thing I saw on [ORGANIZATION] that makes you think it's true, but it's not? No, our [ORGANIZATION] program is true. I've helped quite a few people using that program. You'd genuinely be surprised how many people it brings in. A lot of people. Yes. But it is true. People come in, I see all sorts of specialty credit, different situations, and we help them get into something. Well, that is very, very awesome. It sounds like you guys have tremendous customer service, but I kind of signed up for a time slot on tomorrow afternoon, and I just kind of want a simple explanation of what is the deal with what I've signed up for. Right quick. It would just be an appointment, but what time was that for? Were you looking to reschedule it or were you just kind of curious on what it meant? Yep, I am already scheduled, like at [TIME]. And you have to click to get the voucher deal. Right. As long as you have an appointment, do you have to click to get the voucher? Yes. And you bring the voucher in when you come in. We'll just bring up that you saw the [ORGANIZATION] appointment or you saw the [ORGANIZATION] program and everything, but. And then really quick, this number that you're calling from the [PHONE_NUMBER], is that yourself? That's me, absolutely. Okay, perfect. Can you give me one second just to write it down really fast? I promise you I'm not gonna blow up your phone. Sure. Hey, that's fine. Yeah. [TIME]. I'm pretty sure I'm scheduled for [TIME]. I think it was [TIME]. I want to say [TIME], if you look at my phone number, should have a slot for [TIME] tomorrow. And so if this is a chance, perhaps if I were to trade in my car for a different car as well. Yes, you could do that too. Yeah, that's an option as. Okay. And what would that trade in? Be? Okay. Yeah, [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay. I'm just looking. I'm thinking outside the box here. I'm going backwards with this. So I'm trying to think, is this something that could work for my [MARITAL_STATUS] and I. Well, seriously, I know most folks trade in car to get a nicer, newer car with less mileage, but due to finances, my [MARITAL_STATUS] not able to work right now. We're just really trying to cut back. And so what I'm wanting to do is trade my [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Civic in. It has 111,000 miles, give or take. Between 111 and 112,000 miles. [DATE_INTERVAL], it's alabaster silver [ORGANIZATION] Civic. So I love the car and nothing wrong with it at all. So it's not like I'm trying to get rid of the car. Pardon? It'll be lost for everything forever. Yeah. They lost forever? Yes. I thought you said it'd be lost forever if I trade it into you. Yeah, that's it. They never do. So why. Why would I want to do this? Well, I'm just trying to see if there might be an older [ORGANIZATION] Accord or Civic that kind of comes in with this deal this week. I mean, so you guys are like, these are cars that you repossess because folks weren't able to make payments and whatnot, or. No, this is kind of your regular inventory. It's all of our regular. It's all be like our regular inventory of the used cars and everything too. But we help people who have repossessions on their credit report or people that are. Some people that have. I've seen some people with bankruptcy. I've seen some people with bad credit. We help all sorts of people. That's what the program kind of gets help to all the people out there. You know what I mean? Hey, I appreciate this. I know I'm taking your time away from other customers who are in the moment of buying maybe right now. But see, I know basically there's negative equity. Basically, I get the blue book value. My car right now is about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. But I owe [MONEY_AMOUNT] on my loan that I have through my loan company. So that tells me that's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. That basically, that's negative equity, right? That would be. Yet again. I mean, that's extremely low compared to what I'm used to seeing. When it comes to negative. A lot of people have. Oh, my. I helped one of my customers, actually, who I helped last week. No, not last week. [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. They were about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] split, give or take. Oh, my goodness. It's amazing. Yeah. Thanks for helping them. I mean, they definitely needed your assistance, for sure. Gee. Yeah. So it all depends. So the process is if they say, if I do this, come tomorrow afternoon and look around and see if there's a good used [ORGANIZATION] Corolla, Camry, Cord, or. Yeah, sorry, I'm not a [ORGANIZATION] guy. But anyway, so the question is, basically, if I purchase something with older mileage, then you guys appraise my car for what you would pay me for my car. Basically, you come up with the figure, say, this is what we say your car is worth. And you take that money with the money I still owe on that car, and then you take that into consideration. If I buy a really good price vehicles. See, I just see the thing that says $[MONEY_AMOUNT] car payment. That's listed on the [ORGANIZATION] or [MONEY_AMOUNT] [ORGANIZATION]. But that all depends on everything, right? Yeah, that would be depending on everything. But, I mean, you're looking for something to lower my car payments. My car payment is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm wanting to get it down to maybe [MONEY_AMOUNT] or 200amonth. There you go. Okay. That's the bottom line, huh? So come by and talk to you and guys see what you can do. The bottom line is. Right. Yeah, that's. That's exactly what I was about to say. Yeah, just come on in and we'll help you out, man. I've seen a lot of appreciate it program anytime. Of course. Yeah, I can ask for you. You've been most up. You've been most helpful on the phone. What's your name, sir, again? [PERSON_NAME], like back to the future. Nice. I'm from the [DATE_INTERVAL] myself. I grew up. Grew up in [DATE_INTERVAL]. So, yes. Nice. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. All right, so I can have you tomorrow. Yeah, so it is a big lot. So I am located on the far left side and used car and trucks building and. Yeah, just come on in and ask [PERSON_NAME] and I'll take care of you. And then one last question. Every car that you guys get in before you put them up for sale, do you have time or take time to inspect them or only for the cars that are in really bad shape. That's kind of one last question. So every car that we've taken on trade, what you'll notice they'll have a not for sale sticker on them. Because they all go through reconditioning. It doesn't mean they're not for sale but they go through reconditioning. So they go through the same inspection as a certified pre owned. So It's a whole [MONEY_AMOUNT] point inspection on the whole vehicle. And then after that they go through shop checks everything. They replace any safety things on the car such as mirrors if there's a problem with the mirrors or brakes, tires, all sorts of stuff like that. So they check the whole vehicle. That's the pass. Wow. Okay. So they all have to pass out. That's great. Any shop that I may consider trading in tomorrow, basically it will have to have passed shop, right? Yeah. So like for example, like when you trade in your vehicle, right? It would go. So then we go, we park it with the used with the recent trade ins and then we'd go and put it through shop before we can put it up for sale. Okey dokey. I appreciate it. [PERSON_NAME] and I look forward to talking with you tomorrow afternoon. You are in the used cars and truck side on the left. All right, perfect brother. Talk to you tomorrow. Have a great day man. Bye bye. You too.",success,trade_in,Civic,medium,True,046bc2a5ea0c42ca9529ba7d15f8f567_transcript.json

It's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. So let me take a look here. Just want to make sure, man. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So yeah, I'm not exactly sure what the original warranty is on on a [ORGANIZATION] being that this is a [ORGANIZATION] dealership. Normally like with our vehicles, it's [DURATION] [DURATION] or 50,000 miles. So it's probably something similar. And this vehicle, the warranty barely started about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. So it still has a lot of warranty left on it. Okay, so would you say it's got a [DURATION] [DURATION] warranty on that or less than that? Let me look it up real quick. Thank you, sir. It's for my mother in law. So does this car have navigation? She's adamant about navigation if it's got, you know, the, when you backup camera and all that stuff. Yeah. Let me take a look here for you. I mean normally with newer vehicles like this, they all have, you know, the system. Well, even if it doesn't have navigation, they have the systems where you have your phone paired up to it and then you can just use your phone as the. But. But then it'll pop up on the screen. That's pretty much how like all new cars are now. Gotcha. Yeah. Got blind spot monitor. All right. You know, I'd have to, I'd have to find out about the backup camera. I mean I'd imagine that it, that it would. Most newer cars do. Yeah, yeah, I. Let me look at the pictures, see if it, I'm looking at the picture and I don't like most of my cars have a backup camera. I don't see a little camera thing anywhere in there. I mean I could be wrong. Let me see here. Oh, I think I do see it. If you look at the very rear picture. Yeah. You'll see right above where the M is for [ORGANIZATION]. You'll see a little like kind of spec right there. I believe that's the camera right there. See it? The one on the bumper? No, no, above the license plate. Above the license plate that says [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. See right above the M. There's a little guy right there. Yeah, yeah. That would be the rear view camera. Gotcha. Yeah. Okay. All right. I like the car. Hopefully my mother in law likes this. Can you transfer me to your guy?

Would she be registering in her name? Yes. Okay, I'll tell you the zip code again now. It would be [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Correct. Looks like the tax rate there is 10%. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Yes, sir. What was your last name? [PERSON_NAME]. My name's Last name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, sir. [PERSON_NAME]. What's your last name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. You got it. Okay, let's take a look. F27. Would it be cheaper to use the factory? Would it be cheaper in. Well, what you said it goes by the. By the address. Right. We also have. It's wherever the car is going to be registered. So if it's going to be registered in her [VEHICLE_ID], then we have to use that one. Yeah, that's where it's going to go. Okay, so you have the tax rate. The document fee is $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. There is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] and in or $[MONEY_AMOUNT] in [ORGANIZATION] transfer fees. And based off your tax rate, it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT] in tax. So your total out the door would be. Let me know when you're ready. I can give it to you. Yeah, go ahead. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's actually $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. What's the best price you can give me of that? Oh, we sell all of our cars for the. For the Internet price. Yeah. So [MONEY_AMOUNT] is our selling price. If you, you know, if you want to make an. We don't keep cars at this price point. We don't keep [MONEY_AMOUNT] and [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] of profit in it. We're just kind of. We're moving them for what the market is. Gotcha. But you can't, you can't bring it down. Not even I'd be able to save you maybe, maybe I may be able to save you like a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], but I don't. I don't have [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] to discount, unfortunately. Whatever you can do. We're not financing and we're gonna just pay it out. Right? Sure. Yeah, I can do. Bring it down to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You'd be at [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT].

The super clean car. 1,000 miles and passed all of our inspections by our [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. So yeah, that's what I was asking mine before he passed me to you. I was like. And you find out. I'm pretty sure it does because it's only got a thousand miles if it still has manufactured warranty. And that's kind of. Absolutely. Yes. What's the warranty on that, [PERSON_NAME]? Let's double check. I'll tell you right now. So it looks like powertrain is [DURATION] [DURATION], 60,000 miles. So 20, 28 and then 60,000. Yes, sir. That's for the power. Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah. And you know what? My gosh, my friends and family and my, my clients that have like Toyotas, whether It's a Coroll 4Runner or they. I mean these cars are so inexpensive to maintain and, and they, and they really are really well built cars. This car will. This car, these, these, these newer Toyotas, they last forever. I know. Let me just tell you, between me and you, she shouldn't be buying a car. I'm under [PERSON_AGE] years old and she shouldn't be driving. But you know, [ORGANIZATION] said she could drive and she still, she gave her car to my niece and now she wants a new one. Oh, okay. All right. Let me let this. Yeah, I understand. And you know what? To make your life easy, my friend, if we have to deliver, you know, the car and the paperwork out to her, we can do that. Save her a trip down here [DURATION] [DURATION] drive back to [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. We're happy to do it. Oh, no, it's okay, man. You're in the good now. I'll make a day out of it and just say I don't want to. No problem. I, I hear you. I'm with you. I'm with you on that. I'm with you. I just wanted, I just wanted to extend that courtesy to you. Yeah, no problem. And that the tax rate for [MONEY_AMOUNT], it was 10. 10 even, actually. Yeah, 10% even. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. I hope that everything worked out well and we might see you out there tomorrow. Sounds good, my friend. We'll be here [DURATION] [DURATION] tomorrow. Thank you.

This is [PERSON_NAME] and [ORGANIZATION]. How can I help today? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], we spoke to you [DURATION] [DURATION] times. This is [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME], the [PHONE_NUMBER] who wanted the metallic black RAV4 hybrid. Yes. Hi. How are you? I'm doing good. So we were supposed to get in contact with you today about whether or not that was still in stock. And I called this morning and [PHONE_NUMBER] of your [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] says it was, but it was not going to be arriving for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Let me take a look at that for you. I'm just getting in the office. Let me get my. I'll double check that for you. It was the black limited, right? Yeah. And I have the specs here that you sent me if you want to double check, but yeah, okay. Give me just a second. Yeah, no worries. My system is running so slow today. And it was the. It was a hybrid, correct? Yeah. Okay. Hybrid limited. Okay. So it does look like our vehicle is still in transit. Let's see. Yeah, it looks like it's supposed to be on a truck for delivery today, so it's not here quite yet. My recommendation with this vehicle just being that this [PHONE_NUMBER] with my dealership, we're part of a corporation, so we actually share inventory with about eight [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]. The likelihood that this [PHONE_NUMBER] is going to be available when it hits the ground is very low. Just being that there's not a whole lot of RAV4 hybrid limiteds available or being built right now, my recommendation would be to come in and reserve it because I can't guarantee that it's going to hit the ground and be available for you to purchase at that time. Most of our vehicles that are hybrid, they don't hit the ground without being reserved. I'll tell you what, why don't you guys make me a deal because I've already got a quote from another dealership on [PHONE_NUMBER] exact same vehicle. It does have a little bit more of the bells and whistles, but, you know, it's fine if we can't have the dash cam and [DURATION] [DURATION] other things that the other [PHONE_NUMBER] has. So what I would like to know that we've already got the walk off, like what it's going to cost me. Final price, drive it off the dealership lot, you guys, tell me what you guys will offer me and if it's a better deal than the [PHONE_NUMBER] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], I'll just be honest with you. It's the [PHONE_NUMBER] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. If it's a better deal than what they've offered me, we'll be there in like [DURATION] [DURATION]. So you tell me what you guys can offer me. Yeah, I sent you an Internet adjusted price already. The only thing that doesn't include is our taxes and dmvc. Right. That [PHONE_NUMBER] was for a different vehicle, though. That wasn't for this [PHONE_NUMBER]. So I'm being very specific about what is this [PHONE_NUMBER] going to cost. And I do want to know everything. After taxes and all that other stuff, what's it going to cost? If you can make us a deal better than what they offered, we will come down there and buy this car today, cash. Okay, and what have they offered you? Well. Okay, come on now. I'm not going to tell you what they offered us. I'm just letting you know that we do have an offer, but we'd rather go with you guys because you guys are right down the street. And [LOCATION] [LOCATION], also the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [PHONE_NUMBER] said it won't be here for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], so. Right. So to save us, yours is going to be here. I don't want to go back and forth too much, just being that you kind of know the market already. So in order for me to make you a better deal than what they're offering, I need to know what they're offering. Okay, let's start with [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is that out the door? That's out the door. Okay. Is that a genuine quote or is that just what you're throwing out into the wind? I'm going to throw [MONEY_AMOUNT] out to you and see what you guys can give me. If I told you exactly what they're giving me, then, then what kind of leverage would I have? The reality is, is that we're going to come in there and buy a car, either from you guys or from the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] dealership. Now, here's what you have over them. I'll tell you right now, theirs is not going to be available for another [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yours, according to what I've heard already, is going to be here in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Right. Or it's not going to. It's not going to be [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] after [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Right. It's actually going to be here. Right? Right. Okay. So we want to buy the car now. We don't want to wait [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. So. And we actually took. We actually took today off. We took Monday off from work, both of us. So we can do this. So we're either going to drive to [LOCATION] today or we're going to drive to [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. And that's really what it comes down to. And the reason why I'm being so just upfront with you is because we are actually going to do that today. We are actually going to drive to [LOCATION] [LOCATION] and make the deal with them if your guys deal is not comparable. Yeah, understandable. And just taking a look at the comparison between the quote that I sent you and the block [PHONE_NUMBER], there's only a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] difference. So I'm actually willing to honor the Internet adjusted price that I sent you initially on the, I think it was a white hybrid that we had coming in, that [PHONE_NUMBER] with a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] less. The black [PHONE_NUMBER] that you're looking at is a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] more, which is fine. So I mean I'm willing to honor that pricing that I sent you over. But again, that price does not include your taxes and fees. So you're looking at $[MONEY_AMOUNT] before taxes and fees. Okay. And how much the taxes and fees usually generally cost? I mean, what are we talking about here? Where are you located? We're in [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. So it's going to be about 10% on top of your adjusted price. So we're going to be looking closer to like [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. All right. Well, that's exactly what they offered us for a better car. So that's the, you know, if you want me to be honest with you, that's exactly what they quoted us. But the, the [PHONE_NUMBER] that they're giving us has, has more bells and whistles than that [PHONE_NUMBER] does. Just a few more. But it has paint protection in [DURATION] [DURATION] areas. It has a dash cam, it has chrome tips, it has some of the other things added to it. Man, the difference in the price between the specs that they gave us was only [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So you're basically offering the same thing that they're offering and they're telling us that they're going to charge a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] premium over the MSRP and still able to give us [MONEY_AMOUNT] out the door. Right. That's cool though. I appreciate that ours is a little bit less. I think we're only about [MONEY_AMOUNT] over. And our market adjustment also includes a few other add ons as well. It would include a security system installed in the vehicle as well as the paint and fabric protection that's warrantied by us and the [ORGANIZATION] door guard protectant on the vehicle. I mean, ultimately you're getting the same pricing with additional benefits as well in a timely manner, so. Sure, sure. And that's fair. Interested in moving forward with I can double check and see whether or not this vehicle is being reserved by any of my sister stores with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. As of right now, it looks like it's available. Okay, well, I'll tell you what. The [MARITAL_STATUS] and I are going to go out to eat at a nice restaurant and we're going to sit down and we're going to discuss our options. And we are either going to be driving down to [LOCATION] or [LOCATION] [LOCATION], but give us some time to have that discussion if it's not and I guess maybe should I call you if we do decide to come down there, you know, which is only going to take [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] to get there. If I do decide to come down to [LOCATION], are up to [LOCATION], should I go ahead and call you just to make sure that it hasn't been reserved? I would recommend doing so, yes. Yeah. And just to give you a heads up. Right, okay. Yeah, let me make sure that I have. I think I have. We've been texting [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] times, Right? Yeah, that's giving me my portal number. If you'd like, I can give you my direct line. Yeah, why don't you do that? Okay. Do you have a pen ready? I'm just going to type it into my phone. Go ahead. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Correct. And. And this is [PERSON_NAME], right? Correct. All right, I appreciate your time. Thank you for the quote and thank you for, for, for helping us and not trying to upsell us because we're already past all that. Yeah, no, definitely understand that. I appreciate you being transparent with. Yeah, we just want to get it done. All right, I appreciate your time. Thank you. All right, thanks. I look forward to hearing from you. Bye.

This is [PERSON_NAME] and [ORGANIZATION]. How can I help you? Hi, [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. We talked earlier about the Fiat and we sent you some photos. [PERSON_NAME] sent me numbers, and I'm ready to put down that deposit. I couldn't get a hold of him, so I thought I'd just call the Mainline. Okay, sure. Yeah, I think he might have slipped off with a customer, but I can help you with that. I will. Let's see, I'll have one of my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] send you a link. And so it will either be I can send it by text or by email. Whatever works better. You. Email is probably better. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And you're. You're gonna do [MONEY_AMOUNT] on that? Is that what I heard? Oh, I'll do a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit. Okay. Is that. Yeah, you guys can take or. What's the deposit supposed to be? We can do up to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that's what I thought I'd heard him say. So if you get points, that kind of thing, that's usually people like to do the most. But in any case, I can have them email the link over to you and just keep an eye out for it, and then we'll get the sign in the car that's got it held for you, and we can. I'll let [PERSON_NAME] know. I'm not sure, like, how much paperwork and stuff he's done, so. Yeah. Okay. We'll get you thinking and then do I need to sign the numbers that he sent me? It looks like there's a spot on the bottom for customer signature. Yeah. If you want to sign that and just, like, text it to me, actually, that would be helpful since, like I said, [PERSON_NAME] with a customer, so I can help you before my appointment comes in. Okay. Yeah, I'll have to. Oh, perfect. Yeah, no problem. I'll have to go get it printed out because I do not have a printer at home, but then that'll be. I can do that this afternoon. I did note that on the paperwork it says the color is silver. I just want to make sure there's not actually a silver fee out there that we're mixing it up with. Okay. I know we. I think we have a silver or a gray one, and this one's definitely green. Should be the right one because it's got the stock number or the VIN number? Do you see that anywhere? Yeah, those are both on there. Okay. And does it end in [VEHICLE_ID]? Yes, that's the. Yeah, that VIN numbered. All right, well, let me double check. As long as we've got the vin. The correct VIN on there. Yes. Oh, and the other one's white anyway, so. Yep, we're working on the right one. Yeah, I just wanted you to. Okay, cool. All right, well, thank you. All right. You're welcome. Oh, yes. Oh, sorry. I have a couple more questions before we hang up. Sorry, there must be a delay with our cell phones, but. Yeah, I promise I'm not trying to interrupt you. So with payment deposit, how long is it held for? I'm trying to get a ride down there from [LOCATION]. Either Wednesday or Saturday. Saturday is looking more likely, but I don't even know how many [DURATION] you hold it for, so I just wanted to check on that. Yeah, so I mean, normally we do a deposit and then we go ahead and kind of do some e. Paperwork. Did [PERSON_NAME] talk to you about that, or is he just sending you the numbers? So, I mean, we don't have, like, a set amount of time, but, you know, we can hold it till Saturday if that's where we're at right now on it. If you're not able to make it down till Saturday, then, yeah, we'll hold it that long for sure. Yeah. Okay. Just wanted to make sure. All right, That's. I think, all my questions for the moment. So I'll just look out for your email with the link, and then later on when I sign the paperwork, I'll take a picture of that and text it to you. Okay. All right, that sounds great. Appreciate that. And you've got my cell phone number, too, so you can text me there if you like. Or you can text actually through the system where it looks like [PERSON_NAME] was chatting with you some, too. Oh, okay. Whatever works best. We'll get you taken care of. All right. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. And it's a cute little car. Congratulations. These Fiats, they're tiny, but they're like. I don't know. I kind of like it. Yeah. And especially in that color, it just looks like a rolling jelly bean. Yeah, they're pretty adorable, so. Yeah, it's exciting. Yeah.

"And stuff like that. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help? Hey, Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. This. I left. Hi. Huh. Okay. I had. I had left because, like, like on online. When I looked at it, like, the only reason why I came is because they said that y' all help with people that had previous repos that y' all can help. But I was asking. He was asking me how much I had down. And I told him I didn't know I got paid next week, but I never said that I didn't think to put down, you know, so when he pulled my credit score, I had already explained to him what was going on with my credit score. And when he got the credit score, he, like, stopped right there. He was like, well, this is your credit score right now. We can't do anything. And I was like. He was like, you would have to put [DURATION] lot down. I said, what is [DURATION] lot? Because you. You talking to acronyms. I need to know if [DURATION] lot. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down. I. I never said I didn't have cash to put down, but it said on the website, it said something different. So I told him, I said, so you're going to stop? Like, you can't help me? He was like, no. I said, so it's false advertisement that y' all have on your website. I never said I didn't have money to. To put down. I never said that. But I told him, and I show him. I said, see, you messed yourself out of the deal because you didn't give me an opportunity. Now, had I picked up, I asked him, I said, so how much you asking down? He said, I can't tell you. I can't tell you if you needed [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down. I can't tell you that. But since I told him that, like, when he asked how much I got down, I was like, I don't know. You know, I brought $[MONEY_AMOUNT] with me. But he treat. He didn't treat me. He was unfair with me, and he didn't give me an opportunity, and I don't appreciate that at all. And I told him and I told him and I told him. I said, hey, it's not like I don't have money. I'm [DURATION] [OCCUPATION]. I brought $[MONEY_AMOUNT] because I didn't know what. What my condition was gonna be, right? But make an advertising on Facebook stating that you can help people with repos and all that, but you stop me before I can even to pick out [DURATION] vehicle. Like, I'm not picky. Any vehicle would have. Would have Suited me fine, but since I didn't have [DURATION] down payment, thought that I just wanted to drive off with something, you see? So he don't need to do people like that, because he never know who he. Who he's in panel with. Like, I'm [DURATION] good person. Hey, faithfully. Like, I don't have no problem with that. But he never told me how much. He asked me, how much are you looking down? I said, well, on the website, y' all had something different on there. I just need to know. Like, it's not like I didn't have the money, because I have $[MONEY_AMOUNT] on me, you know? And it's. It's sad because it's like, he didn't give me the opportunity to. I showed him my money. He was like, well, if you got some money, we can talk. I said, oh, so now you want to talk? No, you don't do people like this. Yeah. You don't remind them that, you know, everyone has to just. You just have to treat everyone like they're gonna buy, because you never know. Because I told my daughter. I told her. I said, now, I'm going. I'm taking you to [ORGANIZATION], and I'm gonna put $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down on the [ORGANIZATION] Charger. That's why I'm gonna go, because I felt like it was. It was so. It was [DURATION] bad experience. And I started to tell him, like, not [DURATION] good [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], because you should be able to sell [DURATION] pen if your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. He was nice. So he saw my credit score, and I didn't have no money down. That's what he thought. But I opened my purse, I said, look, I got money. He was like, oh, if you got money, we can talk. No, you didn't want to talk to me when you. He messed himself up. Yeah, great sale. But I had already explained to him about my credit score. So when I had that on there, that's why I was like, okay, I can go there. Because I was supposed to go there the other day anyway. But he kept saying, now, okay, can you tell me about how much? I can't tell you. So if I had, like, $[MONEY_AMOUNT], I know I can get into something. But you treated me like I didn't. You know, and that's sad, and I am so sorry, because I. I wanted to do business with y' all, because I am [DURATION] good player, and I will pay on time. Like, I didn't have no problems with my car that I had the last time. I had no problems with it. But when I had My [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], I was off, and I didn't know how long I was going to be off. I didn't even know that you can get your payments deferred for [DURATION] [DURATION]. I didn't even know that. But I just told them that I wasn't able to pay the notes because I wasn't working and I still had to take care of, you know, like the shop and take care of stuff at home. Yeah, see, had I know that we could have got deferred for [DURATION] [DURATION], I would have had still that car would have been paid for. And that's been since [DATE_INTERVAL]. But he never gave me the opportunity. He's [DURATION] bad [OCCUPATION]. I'm gonna just be honest. He's not good at what he do. I'm gonna have to talk to my [OCCUPATION] about that now. And he'll probably be upset, too, because he's gonna tell him, you know, you made her walk away. And then, you know, now it gives us name, you know, he made me feel like, honestly. Yeah, but I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm go now where I know for [DURATION] fact that I can get [DURATION] car. Because I told him, I said, well, I'll just go somewhere else. He was like, you'll probably still have the same problem there. I said, probably not. But I wanted to give y' all opportunities because I heard nothing but good things about y' all. I don't do business with everybody. You. But you. You such [DURATION] me off of my credit score. And [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] is my uncle. Right. So number define who I am. But you didn't even get an opportunity to sell me [DURATION] car because you basically put me in [DURATION] category. And that's. That. That's bad. That's very bad. It is. It is, because we always tell them you never prejudge nobody. That's how it should be all. Every single time. And he. I show him. I open my purse and show him my money. And you should have seen the look on his. You should have looked look on his face. Yes. And I was just calling you because I didn't know if he was [DURATION] [OCCUPATION] or what, but I just wanted to. I'm the [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION]. Yeah, you. I should have. Anyway, I was supposed to speak with before I left, but I was so upset because I was like, wow. He just basically judge me off of [DURATION] number. Like, you don't know what. How much money I make in my income. Monthly income. My. My monthly income itself is great, but you. You judge me. I make at least $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] month, but you judge me off my credit score. That's crazy. It's sad. It is. It is so sad. But I just, you know, sometimes God got [DURATION] way of showing you things. So maybe he. That is true. Maybe he used me to enlighten the situation on how probably he ain't been getting no sex, you know, because he's turning people away. Because if y' all have an ad on Facebook, I mean, people with bad credit, they took people. They just had some things that going on that hurt their credit, right? You know, give that opportunity to establish people are still recovering from [MEDICAL_CONDITION] and all that, because I know that's how it is. It takes forever to build it back. You know what I mean? Yeah. Oh, my God. I totally understand. Like, I was ready so hard to grow it, and then like, in [DURATION] split second, it's just like, all your hard work just gone. But I, I. Oh, my God. It's sad. Oh, my God. That was like. Yeah. Like, I never said. Not one time did I tell him. He said, I said, I don't know. I said, I get paid next week because, right. I'm [DURATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], so I pay myself. Like, I work for somebody else, right? Every [MONEY_AMOUNT] weeks. Like, my. My shop money that I make for my business, I don't use that as my personal money because, you know, when people do that, they. They overspend. When they know they got money, they overspeed. So I have [DURATION] budget, so it was crazy. But I was just letting you know, because good. That's [DURATION] good thing that you're doing. And I. I was really looking forward to doing business with y' all, but y' all might need to look into his. How he sell his car stuff, because that was. And I'm. I'm [DURATION] very outspoken person. I mean, nice to me. So, you know, I don't know. I was never. I asked him when he showed me my credit score, I said, I had already told you that my credit score was low and why my credit scope, you know? And I said, he kept saying, you might need. You're going to need. You probably don't need [DURATION] lot of money down. I said, okay. I said, what is [DURATION] lot of money? I don't know. I said, so how you gonna tell myself. You speaking in acronyms? Like, what is. What are you saying? Like, [DURATION] lot of money? Are you talking about [MONEY_AMOUNT] or $[MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] or $[MONEY_AMOUNT]? No, because I can't say, well, you need $[MONEY_AMOUNT], you know, down to get [DURATION] vehicle. He never let Me pick out [DURATION] vehicle so he can tell me he never did look at the options. None of that. He stopped me right there at my credit score. And that was [DURATION] bad, bad. He's not [DURATION] good [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. I guarantee you that. And I'm just being. I'm just being honest. And I do appreciate it because I'll definitely let my [OCCUPATION] know today. So thanks to him. Hear me. I will explain. I'm sorry. It broke up [DURATION] little bit. I didn't get that part. I said, if you tell your [OCCUPATION], I will most definitely explain to him exactly how I feel and what he should have done. Like, I would. I'm pressing myself because that's bad with our business. It is. Because then now, you know, you're gonna. If anybody's talking about us, you're gonna be like, oh, no, no, no. So you. No, I don't. I wouldn't do that because. I wouldn't do that because I'm [DURATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and I wouldn't destroy your business like that. Exactly. But imagine if you did. You know what I mean? Like, it could go, you know, both ways. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But. But I would definitely go ahead and speak to them. And if you want, I can go ahead and ask them to reach out to you too, if you're fine with that. I'll definitely do that. Okay. Okay. Thank you. And then. I'm so sorry. The phone number. Oh, no, it's totally fine. I appreciate you giving me [DURATION] call to let me know the best phone number. It's showing me. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Is that the best one? Yes, ma' am. Okay. I'll go ahead and. Go ahead and let my [OCCUPATION] know. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Alrighty. No problem. And I'm so sorry that we couldn't, you know, help you out [DURATION] little bit more. Or who knows, maybe after my [OCCUPATION] calls you, you'll give him [DURATION] second chance. We'll see. Okay. Thank you. Alrighty. No problem.

"Thank you for calling me. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How may I direct your call? Hi, I'm looking to seek this line. Of course. May I just ask for your name second? I'm not who's calling. Yes, this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. All right, thank you. Give me one moment, please. Sa. What's up, [PERSON_NAME]? How are you? It's [PERSON_NAME] over at [ORGANIZATION]. Hey, what's up? So what's going on? How you been? I'm needing to know. I'm good. I'm needing to know who I'm financing through, if it's [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. All right, let me get with. With [PERSON_NAME]. And I remember [PERSON_NAME] doing the tape work for you guys. So let me go ahead and touch base. I think really quick. I'll walk over here right now. Can you hold for me just for one second? I'm about to give you the answer right now. Yeah, of course. Thank you. Give me just one second. Hey, [PERSON_NAME]. [PHONE_NUMBER]. What was the. Your phone number? Hold on. And also, I can't find my tag. I know you said you put it in here. I can't find it nowhere. And so I'm having to register for a new tag or. I. I don't know. I don't know what to do. Well, no, your tag's on the back of the truck. My original tag is on the F150. Oh, you mean the. The one off the F150? Yeah, because I also see a transfer. Oh, yeah. No, no, no. We took it off and we put it on the back when you guys were waiting for a long time and you guys were sitting in the truck and I took it off and I think I gave it to dad. Oh, no. Okay, well, I was looking for it. I can't find it nowhere. One thing I see is the expiration tag. That one where it says. All right, give me one second. We're going to tell you right now what bank you're financing with. Let me see. Yep. Looks like it's [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, can you tell me the loan number? I'm not sure if we'll be able to actually tell you that. That'd probably be only for you. The bank only allows, obviously, the client itself to know the loan number. We wouldn't actually have it ourselves. Okay. I'm trying to figure out how to pay for this thing. Yeah, no, I want a refund if you can. No, no, no, you're fine. Usually you'll get a letter in the mail, basically a welcome letter from the bank itself. And there'll be a QR code, scan it, download the app. But you're more than welcome to call the customer service hotline and give them your social and then log in and download the app and get all in there. Because on [ORGANIZATION], they have a really nice app that you can download and log in and stuff like that. Okay, I'll have to do that. Yeah, just download the app and it'll show you and ask you a couple questions. Put in your social, your phone number, this, this, that, and the other. It'll confirm your email or go to your email. It's a confirmation link and it should log you in. Okay. Now what should I do for my tag? Because it says expires [DATE] [DATE], so I mean, I don't know what to do. I'm sure you can just go to your tag office, your local tag office and pick it up. But I'm. I think we titled it in [LOCATION]. So you're. You're definitely gonna probably have to come down here and go to the local check office in [LOCATION] near your dad's house and get it all knocked out. Okay. Or have Dad. I don't know how that would work, but. Yeah, no, by all means, if you have any more questions, just let me know. Okay, I will. Thank you. Likewise. Have a great day. Thank you, too. Bye.

"Mr. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], 2. That. This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Pleasure speaking with. Yeah, can I speak to [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], please? All right. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How may I direct your call? Is this [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]? No, this is the [OCCUPATION], but I'll connect you to [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Well, I thought that's what the other guy did. I'm sorry. No, you know what? Whenever they don't have it, they ring the. They ring the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Hang on, dear. You're welcome. Yeah, this. Yeah, can you. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Yeah, yesterday. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, sure. How you doing, sir? Yeah, okay. I'm doing pretty good. Yeah, she told me you're gonna try to give me a call. I'm doing pretty good. Okay. All right, so tell me what we're trying to accomplish here. She kind of went over things a little bit that we can use. Use on me, but she saw one used in there, if you guys, like. Now, when I checked last night, it was still here. I need to check today if you're still interested in that one to see if it's still here. You guys live out of town, right? Yes, we live [LOCATION] of [LOCATION]. Okay. All righty. So we want to make sure you guys come to town. We want to make sure we got something for you. So, like I was telling [PERSON_NAME], we can either do a used or a new. The price is going to be very similar. The price that you've got right now that you see on that used is going to be very similar for the price of a new one. So because there's certification, the certification is going to give you, like, the extended warranty and all that comes with it. And. But you also got warranty anyway that's already built in because it's [MONEY_AMOUNT], and it only has less than 900 miles. So either way, you won't lose. So it just depends on what you want. She mentioned something about that she didn't want, really, a black interior. You wanted more like a gray or something like that. And I think that one has kind of a girly interior. Yeah, so. Well, they both have ashes, ash, and tears. Absolutely. Yeah. So. But the deal is, [PERSON_NAME], we can try to work this, you know, to help you out right now. I can go and pull and make sure that key and make sure the vehicle is here. I can check it out to make sure everything looks good, which it should. Certified. Okay. Yeah. But tell me this. What are you guys. Are you guys going to finance or what? Yeah, we'll have to finance something of it. But downtown. Okay. Yes. You have no trading. Okay. All right, so hold on just a minute here. Let me get go to your screen. But the ones that she's looking at, that's the price, right? Plus tax finalizing. Yeah, well, they do. That's what I'm saying. The price. I'm just going to let you know what the sold price is going to be with everything, [PERSON_NAME]. Because there is a certification fee that they put in there. So I was going to tell you what that consists of with the tax titan license, registration. All that is is just a total passage. Of course, what we do as far as to get this car to be certified because as you know, you get also good maintenance treatment. This okay, so you'll get maintenance for [DURATION] [DURATION]. It's the same as you do it. Word on a new car. All right. But you can get the maintenance done. What's the closest [ORGANIZATION] dealership to you? [LOCATION]. Okay. All right. Well, you take it there, you get your maintenance done for [DURATION] [DURATION], 25,000 miles. So that also should be added in there as well. So that's just part of a package that we do on our new cars. So with this car having that kind of miles on it, you'll still have that left. So. But what I would do is instead of guessing what the pricing and all that consists of, I have to put it in the system and then call you back and go over all the pricing with you. Okay. Because my front desk gives me on the pricing and that way I can tell you what it consists of and then what we could do is. Go ahead. I was going to ask you. So what's your. Are you saying that this advertised price of these cars are going to go up? Not the price of it. You're always going to have. Every dealership has [OCCUPATION] ads or they have repurposing pricing they put on the car. What I was going to do was show you what they're putting on in that course. Certification. This vehicle is certified. Okay. So there is a fee that they put on there. Now, when I give you these pricing, [PERSON_NAME], I want you to realize that, you know, I'm gonna, you know, give you the pricing. I'm gonna tell you what your payment would be if you did your credit and what you payment would be and all that. Well, I don't. We can't do this on the phone part. I can. What I was wanting to know is like the bottom [MONEY_AMOUNT] out the door price on one of these cars or either One of them. Okay. Okay. If I could do the. Because I was looking at another cars, I was trying to get around [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] and these, you know, all out the door anyway. It's gonna be hard to do that on it. Yeah, out the door. It's gonna be hard to do that right now. The way everything is right now. We used to be able to have a lot more flexibility. We just don't have it anymore. I mean, if everything is up sky high, you got rates up, you got prices up, houses, cars, everything. So if you find something like that, it's gonna be [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], it will not be a [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And most of that you keep looking on my website. You'll see these vehicles are priced. You'll see these vehicles are priced. And they're priced. They're priced like they're. But they're used. That's what I'm saying. There you go. That's what I'm saying. So that's where the market is enough. I found some and they're, they're cheaper price. But my [MARITAL_STATUS] had found these. So I was just calling. Yeah, I got you. I understand. Well, we're going to do what we can to help you, sir. What I'm saying, I'm just saying, you know, we're caught like this where the prices are high, we can't, we can't do anything to deal with it right now. And so I'm going to try to do what I can to help you. And you know, we're doing it over the phone. We kind of do it so you can try to earn your business. All right, so let me get some information from you and then I'm gonna put it in the system and then I'm going to call you back and we'll go over what we have for you and we'll be, we can narrow things down for you. Okay, well, I'll tell you, I don't need to know that. All I need to know is the, the bottom, out the door price, and that's what I can go. I mean, I can, I can figure the payment. Either I'll go through my personal bank or, or, I mean, I'm not looking for the financing and all. Okay, all right. Okay. All right. That would make it a lot easier than having to go through all this information. Yeah, well, the reason I'm saying that is because when you do that, we can lock the car down for you either way. I mean, but the deal is that sometimes, you know, we're able to give you a little bit More flexibility when it comes to financing and all the other part, you know, sometimes people, if you just look for the outdoor parties, it's going to help you. Sometimes. Either way, it's corny. If you got to go to someone else to get your. Your payment, well, you still got to have time to do that. So we can do it all. We can do it all here for you. Now, if the bottom out the door, pricing where I can do it, then it ain't gonna matter who tries to finance it. Okay? Yeah, yeah, I got you. I'm just trying to make it simple and that way. Okay? Yeah. No, sir, you're not. I'm not taking it that way. No, I'm not taking it that way at all. I've been doing this for a while, so I understand. What's your first name again, Ms. [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME]. What's your first name again? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, give me your address, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, give me your address, please.

[LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. Okay, [LOCATION]. Okay, your zip code. [LOCATION]. Oh, [LOCATION]. All right. [LOCATION]. Okay. All right. Let me. Let me go make sure this vehicle is still here. Where I start giving you all that. Let me put it in the system, and I'll go up to my front desk because I can go through my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] to do that, and then I'll produce all that to you shortly. So you're going to be available within the next [DURATION] [DURATION]? [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], you'll be available. You just call this number here. I'm. I'm on the road. I drive trucks, so. Okay, give me a number. I'll be here. Give me a number. I missed that. Got it. Okay. Yeah, because I think she said you drafted [ORGANIZATION], right? Yes. Okay, well, you on the move, man. All right. Okay. Let me do what I can and then I'll call you back. Okay? Okay, I appreciate you. Okay, [PERSON_NAME]. All right. Talk to you later.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION]. Or. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME] and my [MARITAL_STATUS] went by there yesterday. But I think it was about closing time at the end of the evening and I'm not too sure. Yes, okay. Yeah, I got it. I'm very aware of that man. I did last night when we me and him spoke. I thought he was coming in today. And then when he called me when I was at home already, I was like, well, is there anybody there? But [PERSON_NAME] got with them. He told us that you. That you were supposed to. I guess Mr. [PERSON_NAME] was supposed to be here at [TIME]. Okay, well, he does work night, so he hasn't been already. He's probably still trying to get out of bed because his night's okay. No, that's fine. Yeah. So he will go by there though he did mention, however, a lot of the information of our business is in my name. So I was hoping that maybe we could get a head start and see what I could qualify for with the business loans that way, if that's the trust he wants to like officially go with. And we should see about the whole trade in and the numbers. So that way what I'm going to do. Not like a full day. No, of course. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass the phone to [PERSON_NAME] here. That was helping him last night. Because he's a little more savvy on doing that kind of stuff than I am. And I'm going to be very honest with you. So I'd rather put it in his hands and that way he can get it. Okay, Absolutely. Thank you for your honesty. You're welcome. Here you go, ma' am. Thank you. Hello. Hi. Hi. How are you, ma' am? How is everything? Good. I'm doing good. How about yourself? Good, good. Thank you so much. You Mr. [PERSON_NAME] [MARITAL_STATUS], right? Yes, yes, perfect. I talked to him yesterday, actually. I showed him the truck and everything. So I was talking to [PERSON_NAME]. I remember yesterday he told me that he want to trade his truck, correct? Yes. Okay. And what I was going to ask you is do you guys want to work like everything through the phone or would you like to come so we can walk everything here? Yes. Can we work everything on the phone for right now? It would be a lot easier. He's going to go there soon. However, I would like to at least get at least most of it done so we could see what we're looking at. Like what the numbers look like. What. What are we approved for? For a business loan? How Much. The down payment would be business, right? Yeah. Okay. So that. So in that case, I'm gonna have. We're gonna have to do, like, a business application. And on the meantime, what I was gonna ask you is, like, on the business, have you guys financed something before or never? No, never. We only have, like, a gas card. It's like a small gas card up there. Yeah. So no one. Like, you guys never find something through that. And the truck that he's trading right now, is it your name, his name, my name, your name. And let me ask you this, because usually when it's a business and you never finance something, they always want a guarantor or, like, basically like a cosigner. Can you be on the phone? Yes. Okay, sounds good. So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna send you, like, a link for credit application. If you can fill that up. And I'm gonna text you. What's your phone number? [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay. And is your name [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. Okay. I just texted you from my phone number. I sent you my name. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna. If you can just give me [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], I'm gonna send you the link to the credit application. If you can fill it up. And send me a picture of your driver's license. And I'm gonna need information for the trade, like the VIN number, mileage, and pictures from the trade, like inside, like exterior, interior, and stuff like that. And I'm gonna work on all the numbers for you. Okay. And just to be completely open and honest, I'm sure he told you already that we tried working with [PERSON_NAME], but it was very much. Yeah. And we were comfortable with, like, you know, a high monthly payment if needed. We just need, like, the resource, like, to be able to trade our truck in. And they were offering around, like, [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the truck. And we have a. We owe. Yes. And we owed. We owe [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That was like, about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That would roll over to the new vehicle. Correct. And so with that playing a factor in. I know you said the truck is 60,000 even. However, is there any wiggle room or investment in negotiating something less for that vehicle? Like going off of the [ORGANIZATION] Blue Book? Something that could be at least reasonable. Just so I'm just thinking that way we could be able to qualify for a trade in on top of the standing loan that. For the truck itself. For the truck, yeah. When it comes to that, I will have to talk to my [OCCUPATION]. But the only thing I'm Going to do my best, you know, like to earn. To earn your business and make it happen and what do they call it? And what I was gonna ask you and I forgot. Sorry about that. Are you guys planning to put anything down or.0? We are willing to put some money down, yes. If we need to. Yes, we will. We will. If you work with us, we will, too. Yeah. Okay, Sounds good. Sounds fair enough. So what I'm gonna do, if you can just give me [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], I'll send you a credit app. If you can send me, as I said, like, picture of your driver's license and send me pictures of the trade inside, outside, and send me the VIN number and the mileage. And on the meantime, once you send me that, I'm going to ask you some questions. This one going to be related to your business. And because we don't have, like, online credit Afro business, I think nobody does have it. So I'm asking just some questions so I can fill them up, add them to your credit application, and we can work numbers. And if we agree and we get approved, we'll be very happy to make it happen and move forward. Yes, that would be a blessing. We would love if you guys could help us because we've been trying so, so many different places, and it's just been exhausting. Yeah. I promise you, I'm going to fight for it. I promise you I'm going to do anything I can to make it happen. Awesome. Thank you. All righty. I'll look for your link. Okay. If you can just give me [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] and I'll send it to you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.

Online for like [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm saying [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], but I'll take the [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes, about 39,000 miles. Correct. 39,858 miles. Yeah. Yeah, that's one. And are you looking to trade anything in? No, no. My car was totaled and I had a QX60, which I loved. So I'm just trying to find another one. Perfect. Well, I'm glad you're all right. Yeah, it does show. This one is available. I can shoot you a video. I mean, if the video looks good, be happy to take the next steps and we could arrange everything else from there. Yeah, video would look great. Can you tell me, do you know anything about how many owners it had, you know, before it was turned in? Smoking pets, like, is that information provided to you? I could let me pull the Carfax for any smoking things. I could always check. I mean, typically my certified pre owned, they're in pretty good shape. We do certify them, they got 173 point inspect in, so we check them out mechanically, you know, get them washed. Okay, let me pull the Carfax up right here. And just in case we get disconnected with your cell phone. All right, thank you. I mean, it shows that it has. The Carfax shows it has three, but it looks like, really it was two and then one had it refinanced or. No. Three owners. Yeah, it's got three owners. Okay. It was it like three leases. Like, how is that three owners in [DURATION] [DURATION]? Is that usual? Is that typical? You know, anything possible? A lot of different scenarios. Okay. But I can always shoot you a video. I mean, it looks like it was originally purchased here, traded back in here, and then purchased here again, and then traded right back in. Okay, so probably just someone local, right? Just in, in and out of cars. I also have. I mean, I got more QX 60s, right around that same price range. Miles. I can send those over to you as well. Yeah. Can I kind of tell you my, like, list of what I'm looking for? And then you can send over whatever. Whatever you have. Sure. Is that easiest? Okay, so QX60. Around that price point. No more than 50,000 miles. When you say around that price point, you might be in a little more specific. Like, what range are you looking at? I'm trying to remain below [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Is that like, before your tax title, license? Sure. Okay. And you said under 50,000 miles? Yeah. Okay, what else? And then what I really care about is all the safety features, so all the, like, the blind spot monitor, you know, where it kind of lights up near your. Near your mirror to show someone's in your blind spot. The 360 camera. So when. Like when you park and things like that, all the sensors, like, that's what I really care about. Okay. Black, white, or like the charcoal exterior? The gray. Yeah. Not the silver, though. Definitely. Like the actual gray. Yeah. No silver, no blue. Trying to think what else. I'm forgetting things, [PERSON_NAME]. You wouldn't be open to a dark blue looking kind of. No. Yeah, I don't like that dark, but it is blue. Yeah. Does show. I have a black one with wheat interior, and that one's right around [MONEY_AMOUNT], 40, 1,000 miles, and it's a year newer, so. Okay. Yeah. And definitely interested in that. And then leather seats, for sure. I don't want the leatherette. Okay. Yeah. Let me send these over to you and shoot you a video of that one you originally inquired about. And if you want to take the next steps, we can. Okay, perfect. And then quick question. I was looking at the wheat interior on line in some of the pictures. It shows. Does it wear and tear more easily than the black? Like, I just feel like it was showing a lot of marks and stuff. I'm not sure if it was just that car specifically because I'd be open to It. And I honestly think it might be a bit cooler, but, like, temperature wise. But if it shows wear and tear easily, I might be more tempted to stick with the black interior. I mean, it is white. To be fair, though, a lot of my pictures, as soon as we grade for them, we take pictures when they're not detailed, and then that goes online for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] until it actually gets detailed. Sometimes it is a little dirtier until they get those pictures in. But, I mean, I've got customers who get white and only white, and they really enjoy the white, especially here in [LOCATION]. Okay. Yeah. And then when you send over the cars, will you just note if there's any extra tint on the windows? Someone, you know, tinted them. We actually tint vehicles and we put some door edge guard, door handle protection, and we tint the vehicles so they are tinted. Okay. So it has, like the UV protection, that type of tint. Okay. Okay, great. So all vehicles have tint from this dealership. Yes, the. Right. Any questions I'm not asking or anything you think is worthy to note? No, I mean, I'll shoot you with text if texting works for you. Yeah, that's perfect. Like I said, I'll send you some pictures, links. If you like anything, let me know and we can take the next steps and work something out from here to [LOCATION]. I mean, you're not. You're not too far? Yeah, no, not too far. And then the only other thing is I just want to make sure the leather seats are in good condition. And I know y' all detail them and everything, but if anything looks super used, you know, I'm trying to find a used car that looks new because I know it's possible. So if anything looks super used with a lot of wear and tear, I would just leave that out. I just want to make sure the seats are in good condition. Yeah, for sure. Okay, perfect. Your video, and if I see anything, I'll point it out. That would be great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Yeah, no problem. You have a good day. All right, you too. Bye.

So, like, what was something that you like? What's the price range you were looking for? Because I can send it over to your phone number or an email and then you can take a look and see if it. I want a car price less than $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And I'm planning to pay $[MONEY_AMOUNT] in cash, and I plan to borrow the remaining amount from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, okay, hold on one second, one second. You said [MONEY_AMOUNT] down? [MONEY_AMOUNT], yes, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT], yeah. Okay. Depending. All right, let me.

And currently I have a metallic green. Yeah, you want the emerald green, right? Yeah, so I prefer something like that. Okay. That's a beautiful color combination. So we do have a new color. It is alpine gray. It's like a light gray, bluish kind of look. This looks great. And then we have dark blue. I'm just trying to find you that beige interior. One second. And one more thing. I have to tell you next Monday to. From. For [DURATION] [DURATION]. From next Monday, I'll go on a business trip and I'll come back [DATE] [DATE] so I can. [DATE] [DATE], I'd like to look.

You know, I'll show you what we have now, but probably by then we're going to have some more inventory, so you'll definitely have. Okay, so right now I'm looking at like an electric blue, and then it has macchiato inside with black. I can send this one over to you. You can take a look. This One is for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And this is the [ORGANIZATION] package. That will be the total or try to pay additional more than that. So this one is going to be the price of the vehicle and then there can be the, you know, we have the [OCCUPATION] fees, the [ORGANIZATION]. So just the price of the vehicle is at that [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Okay. Do you have an email that I could send it over to you to take a look? Yeah, I'll see. Do you. So I do have a previous file from you here, but our email is not available to send. You might have to like, you know, sometimes you opt out or like, you know, you say no. So it just switched off on our file. Uh huh. Hold on, let me see. Let's see if I can opt you back in. Let's see how I can do this. One second. Okay. Okay. Let me see if I can figure this out. Okay. So unfortunately, I guess since you have opted out, I can't do anything on my end. Do you have another email at all that we could send it to? Okay. Okay, let me put this one in. Oh yeah, I got it. Opt in. I got an email. Oh yeah, do it. Yeah, if you like. I didn't know if it was sending. Yeah, try to resubscribe or something with. Okay. Just so you could get the information. I don't know what to do. Yeah. What are the options?

Okay, let me send over this first one. Let me know if you get it and then I'll search for some more that fit here. Okay. For the description that you're looking for. Okay, let me see even know if it is the G wagon, is it? I don't even know. I'm just wondering. The price is getting higher or same or lower than [MONEY_AMOUNT], [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. Well from every year now it is going up [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So the price has increased and then with it being the [ORGANIZATION] line, it is a little bit more pricey. Oh, it's like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], like a [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] more with that [ORGANIZATION] package. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I. Because we have some. Yes, we have some GLEs 2024, 350s that are for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] but that's not [ORGANIZATION] line. Oh. So I, I cannot change the. I cannot add [ORGANIZATION] on that car. So you can add it, but it would have to be a build. Yes, you could like build the car. Mm, you could do that. Place an order and Build it. It would take around, like, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Oh, yeah. Okay. All right, I'm sorry. Let me send this over. Let's see. He's online so too. I don't know. Okay.

Every certified pre owned car, truck or SUV is carefully inspected by the manufacturer and only if it passes. Thank you so much for holding. I have [PERSON_NAME] from [ORGANIZATION] on the line for you. Okay. Yeah, hi, this is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME] and I was. I was looking at a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Tundra you guys got sitting down there. Okay, let's look it up here. The white 1,00. Yep, yep. Go ahead. You've got the stock number? Shoot, mister. 0034B. 34B. Got it. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] I guess. Looks like. Yeah, yeah. Now I was going to ask you about it. I mean, I might be interested, but that is pretty high on the price. Are you guys willing to budge on that at all? No. Make us an offer, man. No issues. Yeah, kind of. I was kind of looking at things that are kind of in the same range as it, you know, I was looking in [LOCATION]. There's a [DATE_INTERVAL] that's at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The [DATE_INTERVAL]. That's it. Like so. I mean, I mean, I don't know if this is even in the range, but I mean, I'd be asking you to go down a little bit more. I'd be thinking like somewhere around the range of [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Acre and off basically is what you're. I don't know if that's trying to do. Yeah, well, I don't want to drive in [LOCATION], but I mean, I'm willing to. No, because right now I'm driving a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Custom Trail Boss and I don't love it. It's not a bad truck. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't love it. Right. And why you want to keep making payments on something you don't really care for that much? That's kind of where I'm at. That's where I'm at. So, you know, I mean, if it's something you guys are, you know, willing to consider, you know, I don't want to waste your time by going down there test driving it and then saying, well, this is really where I'm at. I just want to say this is where I'm at from the beginning. Yep. I mean, I mean, first of all, of course, they're all based on the equipment that's in the vehicle. So on, you know, on how those are, how those work out. So there may be the same year thereabouts, but they don't have exactly the same equipment on them. Right, right. You know, and I was looking at some of the fair value. Yeah. And I was kind of looking at some of the fair values that were kind of based around. And it, you know, it's hanging between [MONEY_AMOUNT] and, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT], somewhere in that range. So it's kind of why I figured I'd just ask, you know. Guess it never hurts. Worst thing you could say is no. Right. I mean, I can kind of tentatively get your information over the phone and I could submit an offer and tell them what you'd be willing to pay, and I could find out what they would do if you'd like to do that. Okay. Okay. Do you got my number there? [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? I don't know if you have. It just shows. Yeah, it's my [OCCUPATION]. [PHONE_NUMBER]. That's my cell number. Yeah, [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay. I don't imagine you want to license it under [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], though, right? No, it's going to be under me personally. It's. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. All right, hold on just a sec, [PERSON_NAME]. Let me get some information here. Yeah, there is [PHONE_NUMBER] thing that I did see, though, that's a little bit weird. The E brake has. Is that rust on the E brake? I don't know. I'm not actually looking at the truck right now. Okay, let's see. What. What's your. What's your first name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME].

"This is [PERSON_NAME] at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yes, sir. I was just looking for a truck. Oh, absolutely. And who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], obviously. F350 diesel. Lariat or platinum or something. Oh, absolutely, absolutely. We're. We're the superstore of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] makes sure that we've got the miss most inventory because we sell the most cars. So we've got them. Are you looking at new or pre owned? Because what is it you cut out? Yes, sir.

So where are you calling from, Mr. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. Okay, awesome. I'm looking for. I'm looking for a specific color. Okay, what color are we looking at? I either want that dark charcoal or I want a star light. I like that dark charcoal color, but star white, either or. Okay, let me confirm that. I've got one here, but I want at least a lariat or a platinum or something. I want something loaded, something nice. Okay, Something nice. Fair enough. I got you. I saw one on the air, on the. On the phone, but I don't know if you got it. No, I got 14 new ones. Okay. I've got 14 new ones. Got a black. A black lariat. I've got. I got the white then lariat too, in an ultimate sport. So that. That one's gonna. What is it? Is that a star white? I don't want this flat white. I want that. It's not star white. It's oxford. It's Oxford white. But this one is like the one with the pearls. Is that what you're looking to get? Is the one that's got pearls on it? I just want the one that's got metallic paint. I think that's star white. I haven't. Man. I'm not gonna lie to you, [LOCATION]. There is no new ones that I've seen with star white. Oxford white is what they call it now. Now I looked at one over here and it. I think they call it. I mean, it was glittery. I don't know if it. I thought. And that's what we got. Yeah, and that's what we got. Ours is glittery. That's exactly what I mean. When does it have a. What is it? What colors inside? Hello? Hello? Yes, sir, you hear me? I'm sorry. I guess the mic muted itself, so. Yeah, so I've Got that one, the. That white one again, with, with the pearls, just like you were saying. You know the one that, that glitters. And then I've got a stone gray one. But what is that? Is that a charcoal dark? It kind of looks like a bronze color. That's on the lot too. And then I've got black and then I've got. There's a. Looks like an azure gray. But that. [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, but I've got. Man. Okay, that's fair. Dark gray, you know, charcoal look. Yeah, I get what you're saying. So that, that stone gray, I mean that's. You got to see that one in person. That's a pretty exotic color. I think you'll like that one, but it's called stone gray. This is. Let's see. It's an FX4. Let me see. No, that stone, that stone gray one is not a lariat. It does have the. It does have options. I mean, it's got a 360 camera. It's an FDX. No, I want a lariat or platinum. Okay, so I've got that lariat in that, in that white color. What inside? What's the color on the inside? Black. Damn, I like that Baja. You can't hardly find them though. Got a sunroof. Let me see. Wireless charging, 360 camera. Let's see. Okay, so that one does not have a sunroof. Let's see what else I've got. Hang on. What else colors you got? So I've got the. I've got. Okay, I've got white, black, and then I've got the white in the chrome package and I've got the white in the blackout package. Package. Both lariats. And I've got a black lariat. I don't want black. It's too hard to keep clean. I agree. Yes. I mean, I. Obviously, as far as lariats go, I've got those two white ones. One is a blackout package and one is a chrome. Neither one of them got sunroof or fold down steps. No, lariats are not going to come with foldable steps. Those are only platinums or king ranches in any of them. Only some that are. That would be custom made. Yeah, if they're custom ordered, then they'll have them. But you know, because some of them will come different packaged out and that's because some people order them online a certain way and then, you know, the orders get canceled. But that's how they come in. Right. So. Right. Some of them will. Some of them won't. The, the ones that I. That I do have no foldable steps. But I. I do believe that it's something we can add on neither one of them. White one's got a sunroof. Bright. No sir, but These are again, [MONEY_AMOUNT] [PERSON_NAME]. Cool seats, digital dash. So, I mean, we're pricing them online. We're priced them online for the, for the, for high 70s. It looks like one is [MONEY_AMOUNT] and one is [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And I mean, I could cut you a deal, man, if you like the truck, if, you know, you see yourself in it, you know we're ready to go. I mean, I'll. I'll make you a deal that you wouldn't want to miss. I mean, you said you're local, right? You're next to the diff? No, I live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. Yeah, but I've got a nice trade in. I've got an. I've got an F350 [DATE_INTERVAL] clean with 80,000. Same truck lariat, but it's got sunroof and it's loaded. Okay, well, we need that. And I'm gonna tell you this, with, with a trade in tool, I mean, we, we've got a lot more leverage to make. Make a lot, a lot of things happen. Yeah, we could take care of you on that end because we need that trade. Yeah, I've been offered [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it, but it's cleaner, it's brand new, so it's got 80,000. I want something, man. I really feel like, I mean, I get you more for that, man. Seriously. I mean, you get a new truck from us, I mean, we'll take care of you on yours. That's not going to be a problem. Can you bring it soon? Can you, can you bring it to me soon? Yeah, but is that all you got? You don't have no [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] or platinum or nothing? They're not making them out, boss. Nobody has them. Nobody has them? Nobody. They're not even making platinums or king ranches right now. As far as those new ones, I mean, not many of them. If there is, it's super, super rare. It's actually rare that we have these lariats still. And again, we've only got as far as the lariat. Are they diesel or gas? Let's see. I gotta have diesel. Yeah, it looks like they're going to be the power stroke and diesel the same color? Yeah, it's the same white, but one of them is a blackout package and one of Them is a chrome package. So one of them's got black wheels, black grill, black bumpers, one of them's got chrome and they're both black on the inside. That's correct. No, they don't. I'm [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] away from you. I'm telling you, man, I get people down here from [DURATION], [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] away because we've got the best deals and best prices on these cars. Like we know what we're doing. We're like, we're the number one four store because we're 15% cheaper than any other four store in the [ORGANIZATION] area. And people to [ORGANIZATION] to shop from other states just because of these prices and, and work. I mean, if you're looking for a new [ORGANIZATION], like where the place to go? I have five and the VIN number. Can you. I mean, you know what it's worth, boss? I mean it would just be. I mean, the blind bid is not really going to be what the truck is going to be anyway. But again, you, you have an understanding of where, where it sits. And we're not going to come with an offer that we're going to miss your business on. Like trade ins is not where we miss deals. That's never going to happen if you've got it appraised already. I mean, I'll be with whatever that is. You know, there's no reason to do the whole blind bid and it's just, you know what it's worth. I'm going to get you that plus so that's not going to be an issue. The only thing is like I've got two of ones that you're possibly interested in more than likely. I mean, the price is going to gonna, you know, wrap the deal. So like that price you give me, is that the price or added stuff to it? Because I've looked at a bunch and they tell me this and when it's. That when it's done, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] more. No sir. So no, no, there's, there's, there's no [MONEY_AMOUNT] like we have. We add a bed liner, window tint and wheel locks. But I can tell you that's not [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] we priced them to sell. What is it? Can you send me a video of both trucks to my phone? Oh, absolutely, I'll do that. I'll do that asap. Can I send it to you over at the one number? Yeah, send them to me right now. Okay, I will, I will. And then I'll call you again.

Okay, Pass funds are changed, but work still intact. Okay, good. Okay, so it's. It's. So it's just for the S models, correct? No, let me run the program for you. I have the. What you're asking. I think they're good. Let me see here. Let me run all three models for you so that you have the right information. I believe they're all same. Let me see. Hold on, give me one second here. Are you in state of [LOCATION]? Yeah, I'm in shift billing. Okay. I'm just. It's a different statement on different programs. That's why I ask. So give me a second. I'm running it for you right now. Yeah, I was just answering a question for a fellow who wanted to get into a path mass buy. I mean, that just changed this month, so. But I think the Rogue's still intact. So here it is. Hold on. So let me. SL. It is. Yeah. Zero percent. So SL's are zero percent, SBS are zero percent. Let me run our port. Platinum, just to cover all bases here. Hold on. Platinum. One sec. Here we go. Platinum. Platinums are. Yeah. So all the trims on the Rogue are zero percent. Oh, wow. All right, that's great. That's better. Yeah. All right, so here's. So I checked out your website. I saw you have a number of roads that are in stock. Right. So here's the reality of the situation is my daughter will be the purchaser of the car. Okay. But I'm trying to make it so that she can face it if she's got a little kid like a baby. Sure, sure. Trying to do everything up front. For her. So all she has to do is poop in and. And buy it, you know, with a. With like. It's like I wanted to be in and out at [TIME]. Sure, sure, sure. Well, I'll do all the work up front. Sure, no problem. Yeah, we could see much as possible together online. Then when she comes in, she could just take delivery of it. Going to find and sign up and we're good to go. We could do that. Very good. All right, now, when we were thinking it was just the sv, you've got like a gunmetal gray and a black one that have, you know, some relatively nice stuff. Sure. And they. About [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. You still have those units on the lot right now. So the SV model, we have silver available, we have the black available, and I believe gun metallic was sold. Okay. All right. Well, that's right. She likes black. Okay. All right, so that's one. That's about [MONEY_AMOUNT], more or less. Yeah, yeah, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So, you know. Yeah, yeah. Cool. All right. Because she. She has a 16 and she likes it, so she wants more. All right, so what do we got to do to get this ready for her? So what. What I. Yeah, so what I could do is I could have just, you know, send you the specs. Just make sure. Online with the Internet, you know, with the email, so they make sure we talk about the sync. I don't want to mislead you in any way. So I could send you the window sticker specs on if you like it. We could get the price down and the financing and all that could be applied to the online. And when everything is good to go, monthly payment, everything's disclosed, then you can just tell her what time and I'll get everything ready for her. Great. All right, done. Hold on, let me get a pen here. So hold on one second. Go ahead. What is it? All right, so it's. I'm going to spell it phonetically. It's [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS], and then [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Okay. Om. I'm sorry? Om. Okay, so Gmail. So you're [PERSON_NAME], I'm assuming. Right. So you're still. Okay, so I will send you the window sticker and the specs on the car. And then I guess, you know, you can negotiate on the phone or the email and everything is good. And I can send you a link for your daughter to get the credit up. Done. And once that's done, then it's a matter of letting me know when I'll get the car washed, detailed, have my finance ready for her. You just have to tell me what time. So give me [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] to work that out for you and I will send it over to you right now. Bye, sir. Hi. So we'll talk to you soon. Please tell me your name again. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] here. So you just work with me. Great. Appreciate it. All right, we'll talk to you soon. All right. Bye bye. Thank you.

Hello, sir. Yeah, I am trying to locate him and he must be with a guest right now. Can I take a message and have him call you back or. Yeah, I mean, hold on just a moment. Thank you. It Mr. [PERSON_NAME]. Hold on one minute, I'm going to send him to [PERSON_NAME]. Just a second, just a moment. Hello? [PERSON_NAME]? Hello? Yes. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How are you doing, sir? I'm good, I'm good. You've been a pretty busy boy today, huh? Say it again? I said you've been a busy boy. Oh yeah, no, yeah, we've been busy today. Good to you. All right, well I tried calling you a couple of times and that [PERSON_NAME], she was a bulldog. She said she'll find you. Huh, that's weird because I haven't gotten any messages or any calls or anything. No kidding. All right, well I called, you know, I pressed the button, got sales, you know, said I'm looking for [PERSON_NAME]. They said hold on and [DURATION] times I got lost somewhere. Yeah. Huh, not a problem. You got my email, right? Yes, sir. Okay. By chance, did you hear from my son yet? I have not. Okay. All right, well, you know, I think he certainly wants to talk to you and find out if, you know, you could bird dog a vehicle for my granddaughter. Yeah, you know, she's looking for, you know, a good used car. I think he wants to get his budget, you know, like, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT] or below if possible. Okay. Yeah. And to find her a nice little suv, all wheel drive. It doesn't have to be [ORGANIZATION]. I mean, if it was [ORGANIZATION], all well and good, you know, but you know, I was thinking in the way of a, maybe a [ORGANIZATION] RAV or you know, anything that you would come up with. You know what I mean? And I told my son, I said, listen, you know, [PERSON_NAME] is actually the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] over there at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. And not for anything but the, the [PERSON_NAME] family of dealerships is, you know, one of the largest in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. I mean, in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], period. Right, right. You know, he should be able to come up with something. Yeah, yeah, we got, we got a 99 stores, so we'll be able to come up with something. Okay. Yeah, well, you, you, you know, you, you know, let him know that. And you know, I told my son, listen, don't mess around with carvana, don't mess around with room, whatever the, you know that bullshit. Yeah. You know, stick with somebody who knows the family and is going to do right by us. You know what I mean? Of course. Well, I appreciate that. All right, so what's the story now? Let me ask you a question. Did I read correctly that the 23 has reclining seats in the back of the car? You did? Yep. Okay, well, that's, that's, you know, that's a winner, you know, for my [MARITAL_STATUS] because, and you know, you know, I will be traveling quite a bit with her to different medical facilities. In [DATE_INTERVAL]. She's going to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. And every other month I have to bring her up to [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION], to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. And you know, now my son lives in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION], and my other son now lives in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION], so. Oh, wow. I only got, I only got one of my sons left and I have now yesterday during my [MARITAL_STATUS] [DURATION] [DURATION] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] program, unfortunately we found out that the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] has spread to her spleen. Yeah. So with that, I have to be, you know, even more diligent than I have been, so. Yeah, of course. But, but hey, listen, [PERSON_NAME], you know, I'm a man of faith and I'm driven by love. So something good's gonna happen. Most definitely. Most definitely. So when do you think my car is going to be delivered? See, so it's telling me [DATE] [DATE] to [DATE] [DATE], which is today. So. Actually, hold on, I think I got an email about it. Let me see. So it's scheduled to be scheduled to be dropped off at [TIME] [TIME] today. I guess the truck's running late, so it'll probably dropped off early. Like early early or late tonight, but you know how that goes. So they probably won't start working on until Monday morning, if that. Monday, Tuesday, whatever. Okay, yeah. When? Monday and Tuesday. I got [DURATION] incredibly [DURATION] [DURATION]. Can I get, I, can I get up there like on Wednesday possibly? Let me see, am I here Wednesday? I am off Wednesday. Are you available Thursday or. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, there's there's just. Don't sell my car to somebody else. No, we're not. Been too long. We're not doing that. Okay. So actually Wednesday isn't too cool a day for me. What time now? Thursday. I have to be up in [LOCATION] at [TIME] [TIME] [TIME], but I can I, you know, coming back from [LOCATION], it's going to take me probably [DURATION] [DURATION]. I could probably get by you around [TIME]. Is that okay? That'll be fine. Basically because you're not trading in the car you have now. So this pro, this process is going to be easy. So I literally just, I think I still have like your license and insurance card as well from the last deal. So it'll literally just be a couple pieces of paper we need to sign and then you'll go straight in with [PERSON_NAME]. I'll already have the car ready for you. It'll be pretty, pretty easy. Well, let me ask you a question. Oh, why wouldn't I trade in this car? Wouldn't that be. Oh, I didn't know. Yeah, you definitely can. I just didn't know if you were going to. If your son still wanted it. Well, that's my point. I'm hoping that between now and then. Now I'm not saying, I mean, if I sell it to him directly. You mean. Is that what you're talking about? Mm. Yep. All right. I just thought that I turned it in, used it to give me a better equity position in the new car and then my son could buy it from you with the pre owned warranty. Yes. Now he can do that as well. I mean, if he wants that warranty, that definitely we could do that. Yeah, I'd like to keep it, you know, I mean, am I doing myself an injustice or isn't it. No, one or the other. Yeah. I mean it the way I mean, like you said, it puts you in a little bit better equity position. And plus you get that you're, you're in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], so you, yeah. You get the tax credit for trading in as well. Okay, so that'll help you. All right. Well, I'm looking for you to guide me, you know, and if my son's on board and you know, you get another sale out of it, you know, better yet, you know, because I don't think my son is going to benefit me benefit because I got to pay off my. I got to pay off my loan anyway. Right. You know, and I think you guys, I hope, you know, you and [PERSON_NAME] are going to do right with the numbers. Yeah. Yeah, no, it'll actually be a different [OCCUPATION] since it's the new car side, but like I said, it'll be right. Okay. All right. So [PERSON_NAME] on the pre owned side. Yeah, [ORGANIZATION] on the pre owned side. My [OCCUPATION] here is [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, I. Well, that's, that's who I dealt with originally. Yeah, you've dealt with him before? Oh, yeah, yeah, he's a, he's another well built [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] gentleman, right? Yeah, yeah, he's a well built guy. Oh, yeah, I know. I, I remember that. I think I told him if I had your body, I'd rent it by the [DURATION] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Still appreciate that. Yeah. All right, man, good talking to you and I'll see you Thursday. Yes, sir. I'll see you Thursday. All right. Be well.",success,general_inquiry,RAV,medium,True,04c2798c5fc54fbabf7b8fb1e0410ed4_transcript.json
"Thank you. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [ORGANIZATION]. How am I direct call? Maybe a [OCCUPATION] in [OCCUPATION]? Yeah. Is it regarding anything specific? Well, I'm calling from [LOCATION] and I have a son that's going to be going to [ORGANIZATION] in [DURATION] [DURATION] time and I'm trying to figure out is it better to buy a brand new vehicle in [LOCATION], drive it up, let him go to [ORGANIZATION] for is [DURATION] [DURATION] and then would you guys be willing to buy it back from us? And if you are, what is the best vehicle to buy in [LOCATION]? Well, I'll tell you what, let me, let me transfer over to my, my, my desk real quick and I can talk to you about it. Okay? Okay. All right. And hair short. Hey, so any or sorry, are you guys from [LOCATION]? Yeah, we live in [LOCATION]. Oh, gotcha, gotcha. Okay. My son is either going. I don't think it's this year but there is a possibility which is why I'm calling now. But it should be next year. We're trying to figure out what's the best way to do it is. I know I could buy a brand new vehicle here and drive it for [DURATION] [DURATION] at 12,000km and sell it to you guys for almost the same price but the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] is about 40% less. Oh, got you. Gotcha. I can sneak some money doing it and leaving it there and then he flies home and he doesn't have to make like 3,500 kilometers. Right? Yeah. So is that something you guys would even entertain if we brought a vehicle in and say here's a [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL]. I don't know ZR2. Do you want this? And what would you give it? Is that something you guys? Yeah, yeah. I mean we definitely buy vehicles. I mean it's one of those things where of course us being us and you guys being [NATIONALITY]. Sometimes the [NATIONALITY] vehicles are a little bit different. Sometimes they're worth just a little bit less just because they're made a little bit different on the build sheet. It's one of those things where of course, hey, we always buy vehicles, you know, we're always down to have more inventory. As far as what I could give you whenever that time comes. It really depends on what it would be. It really depends on what the market does, what, what book values do, how the economy is doing X, Y and Z. It's been kind of a roller coaster the last [DURATION] [DURATION]. Of course. Okay. Are you guys short of vehicles up in [LOCATION] too? We're doing a lot better than we were [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. I probably have 200 new vehicles out there and probably 75 used ones. It's getting a lot better. Okay. Yeah. What is the best vehicle to bring up there if I were to buy one? You know, as far as the best resale on vehicles, you're probably looking at an all wheel drive SUV or a four wheel drive pickup truck. That's going to be the things that hold their value the best. Of course, especially up here in [LOCATION], you know, we got some pretty tough winters, so that's usually what holds their value up here as well. Yeah, okay. No, I guess I was looking at trucks. I don't know if it's an AT4 or a Bison or a ZR1 or Z71 Z2 would be better. People buy high end vehicles up there. Are they looking for more for work trucks? We sell a lot of high end vehicles, but then again, we also do sell a lot of work trucks. I mean, it really depends. We kind of have a customer for every seat. You know, it really depends on what they're looking for. A lot of my used stuff, a lot of the more affordable stuff, the cars, they're a little bit more basic, But a lot of my used trucks actually are pretty loaded up. Okay, so that, that would be an option where if you came to say, here's my truck, what would you give to me and you guys, we work out a deal and you take the vehicle off our hat? That is an option. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So I can't commit to a number on what it would be, but of course I would love to take a look at it Whenever that time comes and, and go from there. Of course I will say this. I mean, have you thought about just buying one up here, Driving it for [DURATION] [DURATION] thousand miles while he's up here at [ORGANIZATION] and then selling it back to us? Yeah, that would be another option, right? Yeah, just him and flying up here, buying one and yeah, obviously that, you know, I don't know what he'd put on maybe 2000km and then sell it back to you. Yeah, that would. Could be an option as well, I guess for you guys. Yeah, absolutely. I was saying especially, you know, if we sell a deal, we do a full winterization package, we do [DURATION] [DURATION] things kind of before the sale. And you know, it's one of those things that you want to have to pay for extra or we want to have to dock whenever we buy it back from you. You know, if you bought it from us, It'd pretty much already be, you know, ready to go. Kind of the way that we do it, I would still have to, you know, do a reinspect, but other than that it would be, it'd be good to go. Really just depends on what vehicle you guys would be interested in. I got a lot of inventory out there and I guess it really depends on whenever he's going to be coming up here. Yep. Would you work on a deal where it's in and out at the same time where I buy a vehicle for, I don't know, say [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] and you would, you know, providing there's no dents or scratches. If it's in the same condition, you guarantee a price of [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] or something like that. Do you do anything like that? I mean as I said, it really depends on how long you're planning on keeping the vehicle he's going to be up here for, you know, a [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. It really depends on what the book values do. It's going to be really hard to actually commit even if it's in perfect condition, things like that. And hey, God forbid it does it would definitely affect my job. But if the market crashes and a lot of used vehicles lose a bunch of value, then it would be hard to guarantee the higher number or hey, I've seen the market go up before and so on and so forth. But I can definitely go with my [OCCUPATION] though and talk to him a little bit. Real quick, sir, what was your first name? It's [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And what's your last name for you? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Sorry, you're breaking up just a little bit. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Awesome. [PERSON_NAME], what's the best contact number for you? Awesome. And then I mean you said that you're looking at trucks. I mean are you looking at mid sized trucks, full size trucks? Is there a certain type of truck out there? Is it really just like you just want best bang for your [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then best resale back? Well, I think you would like a truck down there. I really don't. This is going to be a short term purchase or sale for us. So I really don't care what it is. You know, if you guys said, oh, we need brand new trucks or used trucks that have like 10,000 kilometers on them, I'd go buy a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] truck right now and then have it ready so when he drives it up there he'll spend it and then give it to you guys at the end. Oh, I need this one. Or this is such high demand. And obviously depending what year he'd go down. Whether it's this year or if it's next year, I would touch base with you guys again and said, okay, I'm picking up the truck here and he's going to sell it to you in [DURATION] [DURATION] here. What do you want? You could basically tell me what you want and I go buy it and then flip it over to you guys in, you know, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. That's kind of what I was thinking of doing, but I don't know if that's even a thing. Kind of a. Gotcha. Okay. With some ideas. And so, yeah, you said that you're thinking either this year, like this, this fall, that you'd be up here or next year. Yeah, either. Going to be, you know, up in [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] this year, but more. More than likely [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] year. Okay. I need to. I need to get some kind of a business plan. If it's a doable thing in line here. Sometimes they can take order a truck here in [LOCATION]. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Yeah. Let me do some digging, [PERSON_NAME], and if it's okay with you, I will be giving you a call back shortly. Yeah, yeah, no worries. Take. Take [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] week, whatever you guys think of some plans or options or ideas, I want to. I want to do the best thing so it doesn't cost me an arm and a leg. And maybe if it helps you make some money on the other end, that would be great too. Win, win. Yeah, no, absolutely. Okay, well, yeah, give me. Give me a little bit of time. And as I said, as soon as I have a game plan, I'll be giving you a call back. Yeah. What's your name, sir? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, awesome. [PERSON_NAME]. I'm in [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. Anyways. Okay, sounds good. Well, I'll tell you what, Give me some time and I'll be reaching back out. Okay, no worries. Bye. Thanks.

[PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And what's your last name for you? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME].

[PERSON_NAME], what's the best contact number for you? Awesome. And then I mean you said that you're looking at trucks. I mean are you looking at mid sized trucks, full size trucks? Is there a certain type of truck out there or is it really just like you just want best bang for your [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then best resale back? Well, I think you would like a truck down there. I really don't. This is going to be a short term purchase or sale for us. So I really don't care what it is. You know, if you guys said, oh, we need brand new trucks or used trucks that have like 10,000 kilometers on them, I'd go buy a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] truck right now and then have it ready so when he drives it up there he'll spend it and then give it to you guys at the end. Oh, I need this one. Or this is such high demand. And obviously depending what year, he'd go down. Whether it's this year or if it's next year, I would touch base with you guys again and said, okay, I'm picking up the truck here and he's going to sell it to you in [DURATION] [DURATION] here. What do you want? You could basically tell me what you want and I go buy it and then flip it over to you guys in, you know, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. That's kind of what I was thinking of doing, but I don't know if that's even a thing. Kind of a. Gotcha. Okay. With some ideas. And so, yeah, you said that you're thinking either this year, like this, this fall, that you'd be up here or next year. Yeah, either. Going to be, you know, up in [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] this year, but more. More than likely [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] year. Okay. I need to. I need to get some kind of a business plan. If it's a doable thing in line here. Sometimes they can take order a truck here in [LOCATION]. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Yeah. Let me do some digging, [PERSON_NAME], and if it's okay with you, I will be giving you a call back shortly. Yeah, yeah, no worries. Take. Take [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] week, whatever you guys think of some plans or options or ideas, I want to. I want to do the best thing so it doesn't cost me an arm and a leg. And maybe if it helps you make some money on the other end, that would be great too. Win, win. Yeah, no, absolutely. Okay, well, yeah, give me. Give me a little bit of time. And as I said, as soon as I have a game plan, I'll be giving you a call back. Yeah. What's your name, sir? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, awesome. [PERSON_NAME]. I'm in [LOCATION], [LOCATION].

How may help you? Oh, hi, my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Santa Fe. Yes, sir. I'm just wondering if I had a. I got an email from [ORGANIZATION], says I have an anti theft software upgrade. But I've been in conversation with you guys a couple times and I thought we had already done that or maybe I came in and did a different upgrade [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] ago or something because I did it and then you kept calling me and I said, well, I already did this. And you said, oh, yeah, okay, we'll straighten that out. So I'm confused. All right, Mr. [PERSON_NAME], is your Santa Fe a push button start A who? Whenever you start your vehicle, do you press a button to start the vehicle or do you turn a key in an ignition to start your vehicle? Button. It is a push button. Okay, so you were in with us on [DATE] [DATE] and it is showing the recall is on that repair order, but it is also showing update not applicable for start stop button vehicles. It is possible that [ORGANIZATION] has now released one that is applicable for your start stop button vehicle. So bear with me for one moment, Mr. [PERSON_NAME], I'm going to place you on a brief hold. [ORGANIZATION] has really confused us. Excuse me, Is that the anti okay. Is that the anti okay. Pardon me for. Yes, sir, I'm sorry. No, no, Mr. [PERSON_NAME], you're perfectly fine. Pardon me. So, yeah, [ORGANIZATION] has really confused us greatly with this recall. So bear with me for one moment. I'm going to place you on a brief hold. I'm going to call down to my [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], have them run the VIN to see what exactly is available and is not available and what we need to do for your specific vehicle. So bear with me for one moment, Mr. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. All right, thank you. You're very welcome. I'll be right back. Thank you for holding. Your call is valuable to us.

So I'm going to call him and have him run your VIN number so that he could take a look at it and tell me, you know, for sure, if it. If [ORGANIZATION] is going to let us do it or if they're not going to let us do it. He's just writing up a customer right now, so he's going to be just a minute.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] in [ORGANIZATION]. How can I help you? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. Just making some initial inquiries out there. Kind of intrigued by the. The M4 competition. Convertible. Convertible. Gotcha. Yeah. So how it works. Yeah, go ahead. What were you gonna say? No, I see something on the Internet, but from your dealership. But presuming by your early response that nothing is there. Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. So how it works is we have a lot of these coming in and the majority of the time, I would say like 99% of the time, they're already spoken for. So we have to keep them on our website until they're actually contracted. That's the big stickler. So which one were you looking at? Gosh, I've seen so many at so many different places. I apologize. I think it was either. Let me see if it's still on my phone here. How's your [EVENT] [EVENT] going? You know, it's going to get pretty good. We're actually pretty busy here, so it's kind of nice. How's yours going? Yeah, it's my first without her, so I'm. Oh, no. I'm so sorry, man. Okay, thank you. Oh, I'm sorry, I erased that link. It was probably either in black or silver, and my ideal would have been in that very, very dark blue. Gotcha. Would you be open to waiting for one? Well, I mean, everything has, you know, a time and a price. Right? I mean, the right thing at the right time, at the right price, possibly. But how long a wait? I. You know, these. In some inquiries I made like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, before I was taking this seriously, I heard that, that everything. I guess the only new ones we can order now are the [DATE_INTERVAL]. So you might be waiting on any yet to be distributed factory inventory on [DATE_INTERVAL] plus taking orders on [DURATION]. Is that kind of where you're at? You nailed it. Yeah. So we taking orders on [DURATION] right now. And then all the [DATE_INTERVAL] are pretty much spoken for, unless I miss something, which I doubt. So it usually takes around. It's probably [DURATION] [DURATION] or so because they're built in [LOCATION] and it's an end car. So there's a long wait list and allocation that has to get approved by [ORGANIZATION] before they actually build it. So really the majority of that time you're just waiting for an allocation, really. Okay. So yeah. And it's not likely then that, for example, so whenever you get one, like swapping one with another [OCCUPATION], who might have something more compatible to what I'm after is pretty unreasonable too, just because theirs are probably spoken for as well. Well, sort of. If someone. I can see everyone's inventory. Right. So I can see if they have customer names attached to them. I can see if they're available, the whole thing. So what I can do is. And I also have an M5 on my showroom, so there might be a potential where I trade a premium product like an M5 for an M4 that you're looking for. I see. Okay. Well, I. I'd happily let you look, but again, I'm. I do want you to know I am at very, very early stages right now. Yeah. I mean, I'm based. And last. Last car I got was from you guys. Just to give you an idea. I think. I wish I could remember his [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] at that time. [PERSON_NAME]. His last name. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], or. Anyway, I'm sure it's long gone. Yeah, I'm sure there's quite a bit of turnover in the industry. I used to be in it, as a matter of fact. Yeah. So what I've got from you, I took it off your showroom actually was A. Is a [DATE_INTERVAL] S54M Roadster Sapphire. Black on black on black. Whoa. And I still got it. 50,000 original miles on it. It's pristine. It's garaged. It's. You know what I call my 70, 90 car. It only goes outside if it's 70 to 90 degrees. But. But it's. It's lovely. It really is. But. But I'm. I think I'm ready to move on something with a little bit more technology to it. But. But. Yeah. So I'm not in a. In a blazing rush. It's still a pretty good car. But at the same time. Yeah. I'm not. I'm not afraid if the right thing comes up. So. So let me tell you kind of. And maybe you can ask me the questions if you want on a build sheet or something. But. But I'm just. I'm pretty certain I kind of know what I want. And I can live or die with or without one or two options. You know what I mean? Okay. Yeah. Let's go over what you want. You said you want dark blue, so I'm assuming that means tanzanite. There's. There's two separate blues as I. And I'm going off memory, so bear with me, please. But. But I believe there's two blues. And mine would be the darker of the two. Darker blue. So It's. I believe on your selection, I think it was the second one. Not. Not. It was the latter one. Not the early selection. Okay, gotcha. And then what about interior colors? The interior, I really like that. I would call it Camel. I don't know what you guys call it, but it's the. Pretty much all tan, brown. Yeah. Yep. That's cognac. And then you want convertible. Write that down here. Yes. And that would also be the. The darker color on the top, if possible. Yep, sure. Black on top and then. Well, there's two kinds. There's two kinds of black. There's two kinds of blacks. Right. There's two tops available on there? Honestly, not that I know of. I only know of one top. Well, when you go through the build it, there's two. Wow. I actually didn't know that. So darker top. Obviously we don't see a ton of these. Yeah, I get it. You can't do everything. You're probably a specialist in minis. Not me. Okay, rolling right through. Go right ahead. Yeah. And then obviously there's different packages available. Do you know which packages you're looking for? Only if I hear them. So you can get like Driving Assistance Professional, which is going to be the upgraded form of cruise control. It's as close to autonomous driving as [ORGANIZATION] has gotten so far. So if you put on your. Yeah, that's the one I don't want. Okay, gotcha. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, that's not the one. My phone here, hold on. I want to go through these all one by one just to be sure. Thank you. And for convertible competition. IDrive. Yes, definitely. Design. Okay, I see what color you're talking about. Ah, there is a roof option. Wow. That's new to me. And as I recall, I think that there's. It's also a textured look. It's more. There's one that's felt and one that's textured. Can. I couldn't really tell too much on the. On the picture you have there. Yeah. Build your own doesn't do like the best job of visualizing the actual color or the felts or anything like that. So it's a little tricky, but I can find out more about it. Okay. Yeah. I mean, whatever I'm looking for the one that. That is going to look, as I understand it, they're pretty much structurally a hard top with a soft top exterior. Is that fair? Not really. Because when you're in the inside, it's not going to like you're going to be able to Feel the. Feel through it. Basically. Okay, you can. It does. It's pliable, if you will. Okay, gotcha. Okay, let's just stick with the darker one for this, for the concept here. Okay. And then the next package would be the parking assistance package. So that one's 700 bones. And you get 3D camera, automatic parking, stuff like that. Yeah, that one. I want it in there. Parking. Okay, gotcha. And then executive package. So this one's going to give you the heads up display, heated steering wheel, and then remote engine start. Yes. Okay, sick. And then there's a lot of other little packages. So I'm just going to go through them one by 1 for 300. You can get the end shadow line lights. And basically what that is is a black. A blue laser one on the headlight. No, it's not. It's different from that. Okay, good. Yeah, because I don't want the laser one, but I do want the enhanced view on the regular LEDs. Okay, perfect. So that's what I think you've got there. Yeah. And then do you want ventilated seats? Yes. Because I'm not going with the carbon fiber interior seats. Okay. So I do want the regular leather with the venting. Gotcha. You can get a neck warmer. No, thank you. No, thank you. The dashboard's plastic. You can get a [ORGANIZATION] dashboard for $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes. Okay. And then also the carbon fiber. What's the. Oh, I'm sorry. It's that. It's that faux leather dash on top. Yeah, Yep. [ORGANIZATION]. Yep, yep. I'm talking about. Do you know what the drive recorder is? The what? The drive recorder. Drive recorder. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the one. Yes, I do want that. It's an inexpensive option. Yes, yes. Okay. You can get the [ORGANIZATION] carbon exterior package, which is [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Every single accent is gonna be. Okay, I'll add that. That includes the tips of the pipe, right? Correct. I think that includes the tips on the quads. Yeah. Okay. Yep. You have the option for ceramic brakes. And I will give you a recommendation based on your driving. So are you planning on taking this thing to the track or. No, no, I don't want the ceramic brakes. They're just. I've got some race car experience and this is not the environment for them. A rock on the highway could fuck them up. Yeah, I have to talk people out of ceramic brakes pretty often. You would be surprised how much people don't know about them. Yeah, I mean, if it was a coupe, that a CSL or something yeah, okay, fine. But, but not this car. This is, this is really, you know, kind of a. A pretty car that's a wrapped up beast and I want it to kind of stay that way. But it's not going to be. But it's. Most of its drive is going to be, you know, performance oriented, not track oriented. Gotcha. Yeah. I got the opportunity to drive one not convertible, but M4 at the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. And they are absolutely insane. Had ceramic brakes obviously, but yeah, it was pretty crazy. Yeah, it's. It's amazing. And I do like the option too, where it allows this thing to disconnect the four wheel drive and make be rear wheel drive. Yes, sir. And then you can get red calipers or black calipers. I thought that standard on this. They might come blue. They don't. Oh, they do. There's a blue. Okay. Yeah, I'd go with blue. Just blue. Okay, cool. I, I just built. I just build. Your build. And so I have everything I need here, if you don't mind. I have your innings. Well, we haven't got wheels. You haven't got wheels on there yet. I want to make sure that we get the wheels that have the. They're not totally black. They have. I think there's kind of like a gray inlet. Inserts. Not inserts, but kind of. I don't know, if you look at them, I think it's the second wheel option. It kind of has a bit of a polished gray just inside. Mostly black, but a little bit of polished gray on the insides of the black. Are you looking for the bi color then when you pull this up? Okay, yeah, I see them right here. Yeah, it's the first option. 20 inch and double bi colored wheels is what you're looking at. Yeah, 19s on the front though, right? Say that again. But they're 19s on the front, correct? Yes, 19 inches. Okay. Yeah. And then one thing we didn't talk about is trim. So you have the option between four trims. You can get the polished piano black. That's the one. That's the one you want? All right. That was the one. Okay, cool. So how do you want to move forward? Do you want me to try to find one for you and then see how close I can get and let you know if it's available? Yeah, that's. That's precisely where I'm at, is that, you know, if there's, if there's something that's not [DURATION] [DURATION] out that covers 90 something percent, I'd be pretty happy but yeah, that's what I'm looking for would be that if we do completely rule that out, we might try the same sort of thing with a couple different color patterns as well. Maybe that really dark charcoal with. Or black. Excuse me, with a charcoal interior, something like that. But I do have other things I might consider, but I'd like to start with this. Okay, gotcha. And your name's [PERSON_NAME], right? Yeah. Cool. [PERSON_NAME], I have your information here. Let me jump on my locator real quick. I just want to poke around and see what's out there. And whether I find something close or not, I'm just going to reach back out to you and let you know what is available. Okay, that's fine. And I've got an inquiry. I'm probably. I saw that [ORGANIZATION] sometimes seems to have some too. I might be redundant. If so, I apologize. And if I'm screwing up any internal systems you guys have, but I do have an inquiry out to them. I left before I called you. Don't worry about that. We are completely separate and obviously we're going to run your business over them. So I'm not too worried about it. Well, you did once before. Actually, twice before. I'm sorry. I bought. I bought the. I bought the 2000M Roadster S52 and a store Blue with the blue and black interior. And. And it got stolen after 6,000 miles in [DURATION] [DURATION]. And so. So, yeah, which was great, actually, it turned out because the insurance company said just go pick out a new one. Well, by that time you had an S54. So I'm just two of them, as long as it worked out. Actually, you know What? I got three of them from you because I started in [DATE_INTERVAL] when you first did the 2.8 Z3, when. Before you did any [ORGANIZATION] in that car. Wow. Yeah, so, yeah, I started with that one. [DURATION] [DURATION] old when that happened, so. Oh, stop it. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so I do have a little. And, oh, by the way, before that, i33i and a320i. Yeah. Okay, got this. But you've been a [ORGANIZATION] guy forever. Specifically a customer. Yeah, yeah. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. That was his name. He had left [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], I mean, at [ORGANIZATION] and went to work for you guys in the process of the sale. And we made. Yeah, okay. All right. Well, see what you can find. And like I said, I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna write a check to anything tonight, but. But I'm wide open to the idea of. Of making this transition away from this car I've got. Okay, well, let me do a little digging and I'll see what I can find, if I can. Alrighty. And, you know, preferred by email if you get the chance. That would be my preference. Oh, yeah, Let me grab your email from you. What is it? It's [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Perfect. Okay, let me do some digging and I'll reach out. Okay. Okay.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. I may help you. Yeah, I'm trying to get ahold of someone in your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Oh, yeah, I'm a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] here. How can I help? Yeah, I was looking. Do you have any [ORGANIZATION] CRVs? I'm looking specifically for the EXLS. So at the moment I don't currently have any on the lot that are available, but my next most available one is pending to us. It's a white one, so that it'll probably be here closer to the [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] is when it'll land here. Are you just wanting to test drive one or are you kind of ready to get something done on the vehicle? I was looking to possibly buy a vehicle, get one here soon. Tell me, what's the main differences between the EX and the exl? So the EXL pretty much just adds the leather seats, the memory seats, and I think there's. I think those two are the main big things that you'll add on to the EXL from the ex and the power tailgate. I apologize. Uh huh. And the power tailgate. Okay, and how much are. So do you have any EXs in stock at all or are you pretty much out of everything? Everything that's coming in is very presale, so I don't have an EX either. I apologize. But my next EX is a sober one.

Or, you know, even if you have an ex, that would be fine to come look at as well. Okay. All right, I will give you a call if the vehicle does land early. And I have your notes in here, so. And then what I'll do is I'll probably just shoot you a quick text here. Is that? Okay, Just so in case you do happen to see one online or something before I do, you can always shoot me text to you, and then I can always make sure it's here and available for you. Okay? Okay.

Yeah, seven titaniums here at the moment and some more in transit that'll be available in the next [DURATION] [DURATION]. When could you come take a look? That's the planting to be in today.

I have them in right now. I have three of them in right now and two in transit. Would you have to be in today? The ones that you have right now are all dark colors, am I correct? Yes. Yeah, I'm not interested in any dark grays or blacks. All these that are in transit are either silver, white or a blue. A C8 blue. Those are the three that I'm interested in. Okay, I got it. Well you know I can send you some pictures of what we have available. I got 55 [ORGANIZATION] here. I'm sure we have something that'll fit the bill for you. What time would you be able to come in? Listen to me, I want an self or titanium and a light colored car. And right now the only three that I'm interested in are these that are in transit. Okay.

Everything from S to titanium, all wheel drive and with hauling packages and the whole nine yards. Okay, well then why is it, why is it not showing up on the web? So our guy who's supposed to be talking with the people who manage the Website has been out for about [DURATION] [DURATION] sick, so that's why it's not updated properly. I wish we had somebody to do it for him. Okay, well, you need to let me know what you have available. That is an SEL bim. I'm not driving that far unless I can see the actual pictures Moment. Of course. I wouldn't. Yeah. I wouldn't expect you to come [DURATION] [DURATION] without knowing what's here. So let me take a look at my inventory. And you said a light color. SEL or titanium?

So, just loading the options on these vehicles. Okay. Okay. All right. More than half of those are all light colors, so I definitely have something to fit the bill for you. Okay, then one more. The reason why I say the SEL is what I prefer is because they have the leather seats. Not want cloth seats. You want leather seats. Yes. Definitely have [DURATION] [DURATION] of them available for you. Whether they have them or not. Unless it says sel. I'm sorry, you cut out for a second. I can't tell by looking unless it says fbl.

This is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], what's going on? This is [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, [PERSON_NAME]. How's it going, brother? I sent you an email. Did you see it? No, I didn't see it, man. Okay, gotcha gotcha. Because actually I was just emailing you because I was actually talking with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. I just, I was trying to email you what's able to be ordered because you can order ones with the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I didn't know that the ones with the [MONEY_AMOUNT] are already sold out. I thought those were still open for order but I saw that they had taken them off the build website and I was like, huh, where's the 6 [PHONE_NUMBER]? And so I sent you the ones with the 5.7 at least. But yeah, the ones with the [MONEY_AMOUNT] I guess are already sold out. They're done. Yeah, I know, yeah. Which kind of came to my surprise. Yeah. So I was like, oh man. Okay, well so I tried sending an email. I guess it didn't go through. Sometimes by work email might be in the spam folder, I don't know. But yeah, I mean obviously that's what I was going to ask about as well. If you had looked at them and if you wanted to spec out a 57 because you could still get everything the other one's going to have essentially. Just honestly, Obviously not the 6.4 V8, just the 5.7. But then I do have some 5.7s coming in too. So I was thinking about maybe sending you the options on those. I don't know, I mean just however what you want to proceed with that. The problem is those five sevens is just as expensive as the six fours. Right? They're like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] too. Yeah, I mean I wish that I had them here because the ones that I have coming in that are already built are in transit still. So the incentives or anything like that haven't applied yet. I don't know what that's going to look like. We haven't had one of Those like a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] 300 since like [DATE_INTERVAL]. So I mean that's why it's like I don't know what kind of deals anybody got going on on them, but obviously it'd probably be something better than a 6.4 liter I would imagine. But yeah, I mean as far as MSRP goes, I know they're not too different but. But yeah, I mean have you, I know you have one now, but have you thought about maybe another SCAT pack or maybe even a Hellcat? They're too expensive. Then you guys got them up for like what, a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] now? Yeah, I mean a lot of the new ones. Yeah, Some of them even up to like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I mean I've got some pre owned ones that'll get you like in the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I might even have some [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] ones that are hellcats. Shoot. Because if I'm gonna, if I'm gonna do a crap. Yeah, because if I want. Because the Charger. Cuz the chargers give out more space in it than a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I just wanted the 57 because it was. I mean the, the [MONEY_AMOUNT] because it's lighter than the Charger. Yeah, but, but shoot, let me see. Oh, but you don't have a price on those, huh? On the five [DURATION]. No, not. Yeah. I mean I might be able to do this. Let me try this real quick because they're not here yet. I don't know if I could see if factory's doing anything already because we don't at least advertise incentives on them until they get here. Just because the incentives change every month, obviously. But let me see if I can take a VIN from one now and act like as if it was in stock and see if I can get may incentives on them. Maybe we could expect. Hopefully expect something kind of similar once [DATE_INTERVAL] comes around. So let me just check this out here. Yeah, I mean if the vehicle was here right now, if I had it on my lot, they do have a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] incentive, a bonus cash on them. So I mean. Yeah, I mean at least you could expect something like that. And I would imagine it probably wouldn't be too different or any worse or anything, you know, depending on whatever month it comes in. So definitely looks like they got something going on. Because I know right now I don't even. I mean it might be like a [MONEY_AMOUNT] maybe for some of the scat packs. As far as those incentives go. Just a comparison. Yeah, they don't even have any incentives going on right now for Scapax. But like I said, I mean if I had a 300 here right now, that was the V8. They've got $[MONEY_AMOUNT] going on them right now. So I mean, yeah, I mean you could probably expect something like that once you get here. But yeah, I just was looking and I was talking to my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. I'm like, hey, I don't see the 6.4 V L3 hundreds as an option anymore. And he's like, yeah, they sold out a factory, they're already done. I'm like, oh, that would have been nice to know. But yeah, I had to kind of learn that the hard way. That didn't make no sense. Well, [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yeah, I know. I mean you would think because pretty much it's last Call for any and all V8s. You would think that they would allocate at least a little bit more. Four, you know, three hundreds to sell. But I don't know, maybe just so many people jumped on them. I don't know. But yeah, they're definitely. And it's looking like it's going to be permanent. Like they're done with those 6, [PHONE_NUMBER], 3 hundreds. So do you guys got any SR used SRTS or a [ORGANIZATION] SRT? No, any, what do you call it, the [DATE_INTERVAL] Chryslers? Chryslers. I don't think I have anything. Let me look. Yeah, I actually don't even have any even pre owned three hundreds on my lot right now. I thought I had something similar though. Let me, I mean I could go down. Do you have any SRT Challengers? Challengers? Yeah, I think I do actually. Let me look. I thought I saw a couple. Yeah, like I've got one. I think that one might just be an rt. Yeah, I've got one. I got a black on black. It's only got 7,000 miles. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL]. It's a Challenger scat pack. Looks like we got that one going for $[MONEY_AMOUNT] but it's only 7,000 miles certified. So it's got a [DURATION] year old. It's not a wide body. No, that one's just a narrow body. Oh, I wonder if it's a stick though though. No, not for 55. Yeah, I would imagine a stick would probably be nice. A 55 would be less. Yeah, yeah it's an automatic. Yeah, let's see here. I thought I had. Let me look at my, let me look at my new ones just to compare because if I'm. Because, because I'm a buy one, I won't buy wide body man. I'm like I'm, I'm not. I don't want a narrow body. Yeah, yeah, I gotcha. Yeah, because you have one that narrow body right now in your charger. Right? Yeah, gotcha. Yeah, cuz I've got some. Yeah, I've got one, I've got one wide body scat pack. It's a Charger 392, it's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. It's brand new. That one rested [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then. Oh, it looks like we do have another one too. And a black because that one's white. I have a black one too but that one's [MONEY_AMOUNT] a little bit more. I mean if you'd like. You know one thing I could do because Sometimes the website doesn't post everything, especially if we get things on trade. I mean, we just had a big [EVENT] [EVENT] weekend. I could go down to my trade line and see what I have down there because I might have taken something in. I thought I saw something over there that was a. A pre. Owned, like a wide body, either Challenger or Charger, and a scat pack if you want me to go check it out. Yeah, that'd be nice, man. That way, you know, I'll take something for you on the Challenger, you know, see what. See how much I don't care. Like, I've been looking at the SRT 8, the [PHONE_NUMBER], the [DATE_INTERVAL].

"Thanks. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I wasn't sure which number to speak with, but I bought a [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON_NAME], turn that down. [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, and on Monday it got totaled. Okay. And I got the. Everything done with insurance, but I couldn't remember. And I don't have, like, the papers that came with it when I bought it because they took the car and I don't. I didn't grab, like, the [ORGANIZATION] coverage. Who do I call and stuff like that to get that stuff settled. And so I don't know if there's a number I need to go for. What's your last name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. All right. And your first name, sir? [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And you said it was [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago? Yeah, I bought it, I think it was in [DATE_INTERVAL]. That's because I bought a brand new [ORGANIZATION]. It was a Passat. Okay. Yep. Looks like you've gotten a few of them here. Looks like there's a Tiguan in there, too. Yep. So that one is my. That one is my girlfriend. So she drives that. Okay, perfect. Well, hopefully everybody's okay. Yep. Luckily. Yeah. Good, good. Bear with me while I'm pulling this stuff up here. Yeah, no worries. All right, so I'm going to get things pulled up here now. I have [ORGANIZATION]. Is that the best email for you? Okay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull up the contract here and just send it over to you, and it should have a phone number on the bottom of it. That way you have a copy of it. You can reach out to them and get. Get things handled as far as getting the [ORGANIZATION] coverage and everything taken care of. Okay, so it sounds like they totaled it. Are they. Is [ORGANIZATION] going to step in and pay the rest of it off or you get most of it from insurance? So I got quite a bit from insurance. I think I still owe maybe just over [MONEY_AMOUNT], and they're going to give me about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So I'm hoping that [ORGANIZATION] will take care of the rest there. Yeah, you're in pretty good shape there and there. So it's still waiting for this computer's still thinking. So it's going to take a minute. But what I'm going to do is I'm just going to, as soon as this gets up, just email it over to you. If that works. If for some reason I'm unable to get it pulled up, I'll give you a call back. But if you just want to wait for that email, then I'll have everything in there for you. Okay, Perfect. All right. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Bye.

"[PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Yes, hello, [PERSON_NAME]. How are you doing today? I'm doing great. How about yourself? I'm doing good, sir. I'm calling today because I'm wanting some prices on a [ORGANIZATION] and I'm telling you why I'm calling from the phone. I don't have time to sit in a dealership for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] while [OCCUPATION] goes back and forth with management to decide what they want to do. If we do this over the phone or if I tell you what I'm looking for, you can do it and then call me back and I won't have to sit there and be a part of that because that really just gets on my nerves, if you want to know the truth of the matter. But I'll tell you what I'm looking for. Looking for a used [ORGANIZATION] low mileage with navigation and whatever comes with navigation, because I've got to have navigation. I have a. I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Rogue to trade in with it. Okay. I have 130,000 miles on it and I would like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for it because I. That y' all can easily sell it to a parent that wants a hauler for their [PERSON_AGE] kid to drive around to school and maybe they don't want to buy them a brand new one. So it's got 40,000 miles or something left on it. That'll be good. I've had no problem with it. Has new tires and new brakes. I've never put any brakes on it except for one set and I just put them on. Sure. So how many miles did he say the trade had again? At 130,000 miles. Got it. Okay. I have run the tires off of it, but most of it was bringing my dad back to the hospital up here. So. But you don't want to know that. Let's see here. So. Oh, and I want to price on the easement. Color does matter. There's specific colors that I won't take. I would take silver or I would take a white, but any other colors other than that. Let's see what else I can. What else? I. What else? And I would like to figure a price on a new one. And I would like for it to be all wheel drive because my [ORGANIZATION] or my [ORGANIZATION] is all wheel drive. Okay. With sunroof. And this one doesn't have to have a sunroof because I just had to pay $[MONEY_AMOUNT] to get it or the gas. So. And I have pictures of it if that would be helpful. That I could email you or text you over if. If there's a chance that we could. If you could get right with me, I would trade. But I need to know exactly what y' all would be able to get, what y' all would do for me. There's a possibility that I could put down anywhere from a [MONEY_AMOUNT] to $[MONEY_AMOUNT], plus my trade in. But I don't want to get ripped off on my. I don't. I don't want to get ripped off on my trade in which I've already been to. One, they wasn't even going to give me anything for my car. And that's not right. I mean, I know. I know what it's worth and I'm an old lady, but I'm not stupid and I know what I want and I know that it has not been driven wild and it's been taken care of. Legislation came that way. But I don't know. What else do you need from the young man? Well, when it comes to a trade, especially to get like, as much money as possible. And to me, it sounds like if you're wanting, well, closer to $[MONEY_AMOUNT] or something like that, typically, from my experience, it's probably going to be best if you were to try to sell it yourself independently, because we have to base it off of like, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], and a bunch of different sources as to what we would do with the car. And then, of course, assuming the car is in, you know, anywhere from fair to good condition, that's how we'd have to look at it. And generally speaking, you would. We would have to be here for us to give you, like, a number on it that's super accurate. Now I can ask him and see kind of what he thinks the ballpark might be and see if even getting [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it would make sense. Well, I know, but I know what the blue book is. I've already done my research on that. And somebody has already. A dealership has already told me that they would give me $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for my car. This is what comes down to. Because when I say a [OCCUPATION] gets right with you, when they're gonna get right, when you wiki. When they tell the truth and they're. When they're doing, you know, and somebody. Somebody sits and tells me or tells me, and I'm sitting there arguing with them or telling them that the sticker price on the car is blah, blah, blah, and I'm gonna get a trade in on my vehicle and they're still telling me that I'm going to have to pay the $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. There's something not right. And if I do trade with you, I would like whatever the sticker price is, I would like at least $[MONEY_AMOUNT] knocked off because the other place, I requested it and they went and talked to their management and they said, yeah, you let her have it, you know, and I, and they got the price down for them. Only I only want to finance it for [DURATION] [DURATION]. So that's a few other things that. And I know you're saying, well, you have to come in. Well, I don't want to come in. And no, and I get that. And smooth or be smooth. I'm not a smoother. I am a down to business woman. I work at, I work in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I handle large amounts of money every day and I'm by far not stupid. So that's why I'm calling today. I know I sound a little rough on the phone. My bark is worse than my bite, let me tell you. It's just when I come to dealing with car dealerships, I just tell you I don't like doing it because you don't know who's truthful and you don't know who's honest. And I've already run into one that I wouldn't give them [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] of my money for nothing they got. I'm sorry to hear that. And I'll definitely, I'll definitely do whatever I can to make the process simple and easy. Okay? But obviously when it comes to trade, as long as you trust that the condition is, you know, great and all that stuff, then there should be no issues once you bring the car here and then whatever. Obviously I don't know the value of your car either. Right, right. I'm not going to pretend to know. Right. See, I've already talked to somebody and we did this. So we did it just like this. And I told this person what I needed, I told them what I wanted, what kind of what I was looking for first. And then I told them, I asked them, actually, I'm telling what I told you. If you'll get down to business with me and trade right, I'll do business with you. But. And the reason why I'm calling [ORGANIZATION] is my first vehicle was a [ORGANIZATION]. I love my [ORGANIZATION] crv. I mean I loved it more than anything and should have kept it and should have traded for another [ORGANIZATION], but I didn't. That's another story. But to say that's why I'm reaching out to [ORGANIZATION], otherwise I would probably settle. But I want to know what [ORGANIZATION] would do for me. I want to know if they would be as good to me as the other place would be. That's what I'm looking for. So I hear you on that. Okay. And so you kind of have an idea of what I'm looking for. I know that at. Great. My car is worth around [MONEY_AMOUNT] and either [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT] and I know that for a fact. I'm asking for a little bit more for it. Yes I am. But I think, I think it's worth it. If it wasn't worth it, I wouldn't ask for it. So will you be calling me back? Will you be getting me some prices and calling me back? Well first it's going to depend because I don't know. So if you're looking for a pre owned a CRV with about. Well with navigation. I don't believe I have a touring in stock right now which would be what you're looking for because that's going to have the built in navigation. And now if you have, have you ever used [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay or would you be open to the idea of [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay? I don't even have a clue what you do but everybody, I don't even have a clue what that is but everybody's talking about it. My car, my car has navigation but it's not. Whatever that is. Yeah, but it's. So you want navigation that's directly built into the car and it's not going to be like your phone's maps pulled up on this on the little screen in the car. Right. Built in navigation. Well it depends on the price really. And I imagine that's going to be a high [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the built in navigation. It is the top of the line. Yeah. Yes. And how much are they running this day and done? Well when you're talking about a pre owned it just varies on miles, year, condition, a variety of things that I wouldn't, I certainly wouldn't know. I couldn't pin it down because depending on the miles it's going to change the price of the vehicle drastically. You know, I mean, I understand that. Well then who do I need to talk to that can give me some answers? Because your people fan you don't know what this is but you work in the car business and you should know what you have on stock and you should know, you should know, you should be able to go on your computer because I'm unable to go to my computer and find all kinds of information. Well, when I say that, I can't say exactly because I don't have this specific car that you're looking for. And when you say that, I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the fact that like as far as the miles, like it depends on like how many miles the car has and that changes the price drastically. I don't have that specific car that would necessarily have built in navigation. Okay. So what would I find? I mean, close around, who would have something like that that I could even ask for a price? Well, like for example, so yesterday I had a [DATE_INTERVAL] CRV Touring. It had 90,000 miles on it and that one was listed at $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So it just depends. I wouldn't want one that had 90,000 miles on it. Right. I mean, I might as well buy a new car, you know. Mm. I mean, I'm just letting you know, like kind of the general idea, you know. Do you have an idea? Right. And so y' all don't get, I'm assuming y' all don't get those in regularly. And another thing, sir, I wouldn't want one that came from just anywhere. If I bought a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], I would want someone in [LOCATION] to have it and preferably older person. I mean that would be my qualification because they wouldn't, they wouldn't tear it up, it wouldn't be a mess and I would be more than likely getting something that was, that was good. I guess I might say. I guess that's what I'm trying to say. Yeah. So but I'm taking it that I'm wasting your time or that's what I'm assuming at all. And what it is, is it's just like I have to figure out like what we have coming through because if we're going to get a touring and I wouldn't ever say anybody's wasting my time. It's my job to do this and I enjoy this job a lot. And what it is I just have to figure out. Well, I guess let me ask you this. What type of phone do you have? I have an Android phone. Okay. And what you can do with an Android is if you didn't have the built in navigation and let's say you went with an exl, which is a step below the touring. What you can do is you can plug in your phone and you know how you have like [ORGANIZATION] Maps, something on your phone? Uh huh. Yeah. What we can do is you can plug in Your phone, and then you have your maps pulled up on the screen. And I can definitely show you something like that as well, if obviously, once that time comes. Right. So I think I've got this. I think I've kind of got this in my head. So here's how it goes. And you can correct me, but I'm not sure if this is right. But this is what I'm thinking because this is. This. I've heard of this option a lot while I've been looking for automobiles. So I've got an Android phone. I'm going to plug it in, like it's charging. It's going to connect to this screen that's in the car. And once the screen connects in the car, then I'm going to select [ORGANIZATION] Maps. Okay. And let's just say once I select [ORGANIZATION] Maps, I'm saying I want to go to my office in [LOCATION]. So I'm going to have the option to type in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION], [LOCATION], and it will pull up the directions on how to get there. Correct? Right? Correct, yes. Now I've got the principle of that. It took me a minute to get that because, I mean, nobody. The way they talked about it was different. And finally I got to thinking about it one night and I said, [PERSON_NAME], I think it's. My name is [PERSON_NAME], by the way. And so it's nice to meet you too, sweetie. But I. So I think I understand that and I think that that would be good. Now, would that be using my data? It's no different than, like, if you punched in directions on your phone. It doesn't use extra data. It's just as if your phone was normally on. It's not gonna. It's not gonna necessarily charge you anything over, like, having your phone already on, you know? Right. And it doesn't. On a data. Okay. And it wouldn't use the data. That's what you're saying. To my knowledge, I don't believe it does. I mean, I'm not sure how data works in reference to, like, having maps open. I've never even actually thought about that, but I don't believe it would cost you anything. I just wondered, you know, if it would use extra data on my phone, which is not a problem. But I was just curious to see because, see, that would increase the cost of my car. That's basically what it would do because I might have to get more data, you know, so that. That's the kind of the way I think about that. Like I said, I work in. I have A master's degree. [OCCUPATION]. I have a major in [OCCUPATION] and I've been working for over [DURATION] [DURATION]. Or let's just say. Let's just say [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, I got you. I'm not a spring chicken, and I. Yeah, I bet you've not heard that terminology before. I don't believe so, but I like it. It makes sense to me. You haven't heard that expression, young man, I don't think I ever have. Well, let me tell you. Where are you from? Let me ask you that. That might change my mind, too. What's that? Where are you from, [PERSON_NAME]? I'm afraid to tell you that. I bet you are. Where are you? You're gonna have to tell me that, because I know you know where I'm from. I know you can tell by the way I talk. I. All right. I was born and raised in [LOCATION]. Now, oh, my gosh, I wasn't. Okay, I wasn't. I wasn't from, like, one of those big cities. I was from a small farm town in [LOCATION]. Have to bear with me, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. I'm not one of the crazies, I promise. So what part [LOCATION] [LOCATION] you said you was farmed? What did y' all raise on Yalls farm down there? Well, a lot of it. So it's like. I wasn't necessarily. I was in the suburban part of it, but it was mostly almonds. There's so many almond trees out where I'm from. From the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Have you ever been out there? And it's beautiful place. Yes, I have been out there. When I graduated from high school, my aunt lived in [LOCATION], and then she lived some other place. But for my high school graduation present or no, my college graduation present, she sent each of when we graduated from college. I have two other sisters. She sent us, when we graduated, a plane ticket. And we went out there and visited her. Now, that was, for me, that was [DATE_INTERVAL]. Whenever I graduated from college. I really should have graduated in [DATE_INTERVAL], but it took me [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], so I was able to go to [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION], we went to [LOCATION]. There were some other places. I can't remember that we went in the upper part [LOCATION] [LOCATION], kind of to the north, but we didn't make it up to the [LOCATION], you know. In fact, she sent. She sent my dad to [LOCATION] seedlings. And I live. I'm from [LOCATION] [LOCATION], okay. And we set those out when I was a young girl. And we tried our best to get them to grow, but they never would grow. It would just be like they would be alive, but they would just be existing there. Yeah. And then finally they died. They just. The soil was just not right for them, you know? Yeah. So. So anyway. Well, well, so I can see where you would be afraid to tell me where you're from, but I won't hold it against you, young man. I mean, everybody comes from somewhere. I'll tell you about [PERSON_NAME]. I'm from a little old country town about 50 miles down the road here. And let me tell you something. I'm a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Before I moved up here, I have 30 head of cattle. Still got about 15 head back home. My little nephew helps me take care of them. I can operate a tractor and I bush hog. I can cut bushes and dig fence posts. I can split posts and split firewood. So that should tell you what kind of person you're dealing with. I am a hard worker. I work hard. My money is very important to me. And I am a [POLITICAL_AFFILIATION], and most people don't like [POLITICAL_AFFILIATION]. And I'll tell you something else, young man. I'm not a yes woman. And that's very true. I get that. Honestly, I get it from my daddy. But that's just a little bit about me. So would you be able to look up and it doesn't have to be a touring. It doesn't have to be the top of the line, because my car now is not top of the line. Okay. There's something better than it. Okay. But it serves me well. Trust you me, when you're. When you made. I live up here. I have a home back home. I used to come, go. Well, I still. I go home on Fridays and come back on Sunday. But when my dad was alive and still at home, I'd go home on Friday. He wouldn't be. He would be [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. I think it's Saturday morning. Me and my mom would have to carry him to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], then go back home and then I would come back on Sunday. So that turned the miles got on my car. My dad. I was making double trips, triple trips up here to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], you know, just to keep. Really. Just to keep him alive. And I need a vehicle, young man. And if [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] or whatever, if I. I don't. You probably don't ever see him, but he comes by quite a bit more than you think, actually. Really? Well, he's one of the nicest guys. I used to watch racing a lot and I'm familiar with his name, but I'm not so familiar. I'm not familiar with his heart. You see that. That. That's the key part right there is the heart. Sure thing. You know, it's. It's. How do you. Do you want this customer or do you not want this customer? You know, what would you do to get this customer to win this customer's business? So what else do you need from me? Because I know I'm sitting here running my mouth and. It's okay, [PERSON_NAME], I don't mind. I got nothing better going on. I appreciate you talking to me today. As far as what I need, if you could get me some photos of it or email. Well, you see, hold on, young man, because, you see, I am. I am. I can. I work from home and I. I can work, do all kinds of computer stuff, you know, but when it comes to this crazy phone, I don't. All I use it to do is to call my family. I hardly ever text, I hardly ever send an email, maybe one or two emails every morning again. So let me get your. What's your number, sweetheart? Okay. Okay. [PHONE_NUMBER]. What's your name? I'm [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. What's your last name? [PERSON_NAME]. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. I'm not being noticed. My last name is [PERSON_NAME]. Okay? Just. I never want you. I never want you to forget me. Okay? You won't ever forget me. Okay. So let me get your number in this phone here and let me see if I can get these pictures fixed open to you. And I have my VIN number if that would help also. Okay. Let's see here. [PERSON_NAME], by any chance, have you. Have you called in here before? I have, but I do not want to talk to that boy again. Okay? Understood. Now, it looks like he may have already gotten the [ORGANIZATION] Rogue in. Okay. And it's a [DATE_INTERVAL] SV, all wheel drive, right? Yep. Okay, sounds good. Let me. Let me work on this. Let me get with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], figure out what we got, and let me see what I can do for you. Okay? Okay. And I'll just tell you why. The reason I don't want to deal with them with him. Okay. So this is a big thing with me. Honesty is a big thing. If somebody tells me they're going to do something, I expect them to do it. If they say, I'm going to call, I will call you back tomorrow. I expect them to call me back tomorrow. So I assume. This is what I assumed. I assumed that [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] did not want to deal with me. They did not have any. They did not want to work with me. They didn't want my business. That was what. I assume we're going to find this out. I'm going to find out for sure. So I'm assuming that's why he didn't call me back yesterday was because he already knew that [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [ORGANIZATION] did not want my business. Did he talk to you yesterday? No. He just not call you back later? He did not call me back. He said he would call me back no later than yesterday afternoon, and I never received a call back. So that's why I called back, just to talk to somebody else. Because when somebody tells me they're going to do something, just call me back and say, oh, listen, if this is taking me longer than what I thought, I'll call you back no later than Monday, you know, I should have a good answer for you on Monday, you know, or something like that. Just be honest with me, you know. Okay. And that's all I request, [PERSON_NAME]. No worries, [PERSON_NAME]. I do appreciate you and I will. I will get back to you, hopefully within next hour. It's just going to depend on my [OCCUPATION]. But once you text me that stuff over, I can shoot you a text, let you know what I'm working on. Okay. You need me to send you those pictures? Is that what you said? Yeah. Okay, so hold on. Let me get them to you now before I get off this dadgum phone. Because I'll tell you what. I don't know if I can even get them to you. This thing. I mean, I shouldn't say it like this, but I hate the dad gone son. Oh, my gosh. I just. Now, how in the world did I do that yesterday? Might have to think about it. So here's your call. But I want to take. Can you send. Can you text me a text and let me. Okay. That would be the easiest way. I think this is. This. I'm not as ignorant. I'm just ignorant with this song. That's okay. I get it. They continue to get more and more complicated. I'm starting to have a hard time figuring it out. You know what I wish I had back? My very first song. It wasn't my first song. It was more like my third song. A fourth song. I wish I had my little BlackBerry back. I remember those fancy phones my dad had. Yes. I wish I had that little phone back. Course you didn't have. You didn't have. Let's see here. I'm gonna have to think about this. So that's not that. So then. Oh, yes. Maybe this is. Yes. So I want to. This. Okay. That. That's the band. That's that, that's that, and that's that. Okay. I don't know what I'm sending. I'm sending everything I got. Tell you not only I think that other than in the bottom is my insurance card and you don't need my medical insurance card. So I'm sending the picture. I don't know if you think you need another one. I can go try to take another picture, but I had a hellacious time trying to get me on the camera. I. I don't even know how to operate my camera. Ain't that awful? Okay, I know I kindred you enough, but I sure. I do appreciate. Let me tell you, I do appreciate your time and no worries. And I appreciate. I appreciate your help and I would appreciate all you could do for me because I. I liked my [ORGANIZATION] better than I liked my [ORGANIZATION]. And I wouldn't have. I wouldn't have called you if I hadn't thought that if y' all would deal with me that I would. That I would try again. But in y' all still may not. But just do what you can, sweetheart. I surely do appreciate it. Yeah. And I sure will, [PERSON_NAME]. Just give me a little bit, okay? That's all right. And hey, if you can't get it done today, call me and let me know. Leave me a message and say it's gonna be tomorrow. I can't get it all completed. No worries. I will keep you in the loop. I promise. I'm not gonna. Not going to forget about you, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay.

So it makes the car about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And what is that, that [DATE_INTERVAL] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What is it? What do you call that? So it's [OCCUPATION] added accessories. So what it has, it's paint and fabric protection for your vehicle. For example, you know how tree SAP, burp, things like that could be very acidic to your paint.

So whenever you do open the door, you don't ding them or mess up the doors and then the door handles as well. You know how when you open the door you put your nails, you might scratch it. So those protections as well. So it's an added bundle of $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Supposing you don't want that? Do you have to have this? Well, for the most part, these prices are set. We do have those included in the vehicle. But I wouldn't be able to tell you if I could take it off or. No, I don't think the prices, unfortunately, [PERSON_NAME].

[PERSON_NAME], I bought The Fat Bob [DATE_INTERVAL] in [DATE_INTERVAL]. What's up, dude? How you been? I'm alive and well. What about you? Good, good. Just working. I seen that you guys got that [DATE_INTERVAL] breakout maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. I noticed you guys dropped the price. Yeah, man, we. We're so overloaded right now. We've been marking things down. Let's see. Yeah, still have it in stock, though. [DATE_INTERVAL] breakout. It's the [ORGANIZATION] pro street, right? Yeah. Yeah. Holy, that's thick. I see [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, I know you guys had it for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, yeah. I've heard mixed reviews on that motor. The 110. Yeah, I mean, it runs. It runs a bit. It runs a bit hot, but I mean, it's a 1. It's a 110. It's like the CVL motor. If that motor is in any other bike, like a Street Glide or a Road Glide, it's Normally like, what, [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]? But it is the last year they made it, so it's like the, you know, the first years definitely ran a little bit hotter, but they kind of smooth things out a little bit. But it's a badass bike. Super clean, custom paint job, everything's upgraded on it. Yeah, I would say you could come and test ride it tomorrow. But tomorrow's [DATE_INTERVAL] ride, which is why we have all those prices and there's like three to [MONEY_AMOUNT] people here. It's kind of hard to get. Yeah, I bet. No. No worries. I can send videos of it, though. Or how can I help? Yeah, I'm interested in it. I could literally pay off my bike, you know, this [DURATION] [DURATION] next week, but I don't know. I'm trying to see if I. Go ahead. Are you financed through [ORGANIZATION]? Yeah. Well, you can before you pay it off. Because sometimes when you pay it off, you gotta wait like a. Like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] for everything to process. Yeah, you can either take the money, pay off the bike, or if you see it, you like it. I can take your bike in on trade and that current loan and I can pretty much show you what it looks like to ride home. With trading in, we take care of all the [ORGANIZATION] shit, we take care of all the loan. Okay, so that's an option. Yeah, I know my credit was pretty bad. I know it went up a bit. Do you recommend just paying off mine or trading it in? Would that affect anything? I mean, other than just having to do it yourself, but I mean, that's what we do. Would you be trading in your bike regardless or would you be where, you know, where you keep it on, where you're thinking of keeping it? I was thinking of trading it in. Cool, then don't even worry. At least before you paid off, at least cruising here, I'll get you your [DURATION] [DURATION] payoff and see if there's any cancelables, like if you bought any, like extended warranty or gap that can come off your current loan. Okay. It's a 13. Fat Bob, right? Yeah. Yeah. Dude, it's been a minute. Good to see you, dude. Good to hear from you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been wanting that breakout for a while. The one in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? Had it. The [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], they had it for [MONEY_AMOUNT], but you gave me a killer deal, so I went with you. I plan to hook it up, I really do. Yeah, I noticed you guys got this breakout like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago and I just keep looking at it and then today I looked at it again, I noticed the price difference. I was like, film a call and see what we can do with. I owe [MONEY_AMOUNT] on the fat Bob. That's great, that's. You put yourself in a good position. Yeah. So I could either pay it off or do a trade in if. Yeah, whatever works, I guess. Before paying it off, give me [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] of your time. Come in, ride the breakout. If you allocate your trade, if you absolutely love it, I'll show you everything I can do. Okay, if I send a [PHONE_NUMBER], is that a good way to reach you? Yeah, perfect. Let's do this. I will. It sounds like you took good care of your current loan, right? With [ORGANIZATION]. Say that again. It sounds like you took care of your current loan. If you're. Yeah, I've been paying. Yeah, I've been paying. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I think [DURATION] [DURATION]. I paid the [MONEY_AMOUNT], whatever the minimum was. That's good, man. I mean, that [ORGANIZATION] is very kind. When you. When you finish up a loan and then come back to them, they hook it up. So. Cool. If you want to, you don't have to, but I can send you the [ORGANIZATION] application. It's good for [DURATION] [DURATION] at any dealership. Basically will allow me to, like, have your pre approval all set up. So you just walk in, test ride, make sure it's the right bike, and then I have, like, almost everything ready for you in terms of figures and shit like that. Accurate figures. Oh, gotcha. Okay. Only if you're there. So. Okay. And so I'd have to redo the application and then my current loan is going to show up. Right. With the whatever I owe. Yeah, it shows me that's what else is important about it is like, it plugs everything in and shows me where you're at with the fat bomb. And so you just kind of figure it out from there. Okay, cooler. I'll send you a text soon. And then that's the best way to reach me. Oh, yeah, shoot me a text to this number because I lost my other phone and I don't think I ever saved your number.

I don't know what documents essentially you need, but I forwarded my notes, the V spec for the car that we're trying to get as far as the price point and what you signed as far as the out the door.

We do in stock. What? The sport model, not the toy. Yeah. So let me. Hold on. Give me one second. Let me see. We have a couple here and my [MARITAL_STATUS] yelling from the shower. Silver or white? Why has it got to be silver or white? It's the only colors he'll allow. I'm kidding. Silver. Okay. Excuse me. I'm walking. I was upstairs. I'm walking downstairs. Look at the law. Let me ask you, since those. Since those batteries that for the hybrid cost like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], is it better? I mean, it's all. I mean, you drive so much. Do you know what I'm saying? It's about the mileage. You know what I mean? That's. That's why you buy a hybrid, for the gas mileage. I mean, I wouldn't worry about the battery. It's warranty for [DURATION] [DURATION] or a hundred thousand miles, which. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you know how much you drive like an animal. Hold on. Yep. Gotta get to work. Someone's got to do it, right? Yeah. So we have a silver one here and we have a white one here of which the. The hybrid sword. What's the price on the white one? I don't know. I mean, they're upstairs. Give me probably [DURATION] [DURATION] and I will call you back. If we have a. Okay. We have a Saturday morning meeting, which I'm. You got me out of it. Which. Thank you.

I'm surprised you're still in this business. Let me Tell you, I'm surprised I held too stupid as anything else. I'm trying to get my ass ever that they want. Hold on, I'm just going to tell you how much cheaper it is. So you, you think that the hybrid is a better car than the regular crv? I do. They drive a hell a lot nicer, to be honest with you. I think. Why? They just smoother, quieter. I mean, that's. That's the why. So there are some [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] cheaper than the. Than the. Yeah, yeah. It would be roughly $[MONEY_AMOUNT] cheaper [DURATION] [DURATION]. Translation to, you know, for every thousand, it's about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Just come get one. Yeah, I'm working on it. I'm looking at one right now. White one. Which one do you want? We got one silver one and two white ones. Tell me what color, I'll put you. Okay, fine, I'll put you. What's the interior color? Black.

We don't have these cars. There is no special. I'll see if I can get some. You know. You know, and people don't realize the markup on A [ORGANIZATION] is 7% and there's no funny money. There is nothing. So I mean, it's. There's not [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] on a [ORGANIZATION] at all. It's crazy, but I'll beat him up for something. It is [EVENT] [EVENT] and you repeat customer, but your presence is your leverage. But my what? Your presence is your leverage. Yeah, well, I don't know. So the white one. Because I know the white one's like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] more than the silver one. It's $[MONEY_AMOUNT] more. Okay, well, I know there's a upcharge for the white. Yeah, yeah. But I mean, you know, if you're financing, it's, it's. You're talking what was the price? But to get what you want, [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then probably no, probably [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Five because it's white. You know, they, when they list the prices, they don't put on the upcharge for color. Okay, all right, all right. Well, let me talk to the [MARITAL_STATUS]. Talk to [MARITAL_STATUS]. Let me know Babe, how much is your silver one? It'd be [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] less. How come your prices are higher than [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? They're not.

Can you hear me better now? Yeah, yeah, I can hear you better now. I don't know what happened is I'm breaking up and just catching bits and pieces and. Okay, well, hopefully you can hear me this time first. For some reason, it's not pulling the part number by the VIN number, but when I take the VIN number out, it looks like they're all the same. So I've actually. I've actually got two of them in stock. Okay. You guys don't deliver in here, do you? I have been known to. Yeah. I think I've got something for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], which I think is right next door. Y' all close, isn't it? Yeah, it's real close to. Yeah, I think it'll be in here tomorrow. I could probably arrange to get something down that way. Tomorrow. Yeah, that'll work just fine. Okay. And I don't have any remands available to me. That's a new starter. List price on [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Okay. You have my card number still? No, I don't keep anything like that. Okay. Can I give you my card number or do you want to wait till you just go to deliver it or what? No, let me get something to write on here. Go ahead. Okay, it is [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER]. Expire.

"Hey, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Let me direct your call. Can I please get to somebody in sales, please? Sure. Give me one second. I'll find somebody for you. Thank you. How about who's experienced? [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. He says no. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, so. So I was gonna see if they can give me some information. I have a [ORGANIZATION] Rogue that I had for [DURATION] [DURATION]. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. I did finance it through, you know, [ORGANIZATION]. Of course, I still, I think I still owe like [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] on it. And I have no down payment and I did put [MONEY_AMOUNT] when I first got the car. Of course my credit rating was like [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. But they were able to find me my bank that I'm with now that I still have at 9.8%. My credit score has gone up for the last [DURATION] [DURATION]. So the main part that I kind of came interested in is that I got the pleasure of driving a [ORGANIZATION] Murano. Okay. A lot more space here. I love the inside. This was a [DATE_INTERVAL]. It's a rent a car and I like it. So. Yeah, a little wide, right? Yeah, I'm kind of like, you know, curvy. And the [ORGANIZATION] that I have now, which was the only pick that I only had at that time, you know, and it only had 34 miles when I drove off the lot in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. But when I came into this one here, it's a lot more roomy. My body fits in the seats, they're comfortable. It rides a lot better and I like the amenities that are in there. How much is a brand new one for? [DATE_INTERVAL], if not, if it's too expensive, maybe a [DATE_INTERVAL], but maybe with very little mileage because my car, it only has 17,000 miles on it. And you said it's a [DATE_INTERVAL] the one you're in now? Yes, the one I have now is a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] road. Okay. So new ones. I mean, the SV, I have one here with the MSRP of [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I mean, you have a [OCCUPATION] discount it of [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But I do have some 21s and 22s that are pre owned that are, you know, just as good. They're, you know, they have real low miles. So how many miles do you have on those? One of them is, has like, let's see. And is this a good number just in case we. Yes. And, and who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. [PERSON_NAME] for the last name. I'm sorry. [PERSON_NAME] and [LOCATION] put together. Okay, so I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] that has 3,100 miles. I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] that has 31,000 miles. I have. Okay, so the [DATE_INTERVAL]. The [DATE_INTERVAL] that you have for 3,100 miles on it. How much is that one? That one's [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What do you think of my chances of getting in that one? I mean, it sounds like you've made all your payments and you have possibly have equity in the vehicle. I mean, can you come in tonight so we can check it out? Oh, no, I just came from new grandpa time. I can't, not tonight. So. Yeah, it's gonna. I don't know exactly. I work. So it might be in a couple of weeks that I can get in there. I'm not sure because I have, you know, a tight schedule. You know, I got. I mean, and the. As far as the used Moranos, I mean, they kind of come and go. But either way, you know, even if it's. Whether it's a new one or a used one, I'll definitely put my best foot forward to try to help you out when you're able. How much is the [DATE_INTERVAL] that you said that you had? The [DATE_INTERVAL] is. Believe it's about 26,000. Yeah, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's right under [MONEY_AMOUNT] online. It's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes, ma' am. And how many miles does that one have on it? That one has like 31,000. Yeah, so that one has real low miles, too. Yeah, but mine has only 17. I got you. And it's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. So what then? That's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. So that's if you're newer. What is your schedule looking like this this [DURATION]? I work, so I'm pretty busy at work right now. Yeah. And my. My son's car is like out of commission, so he's kind of like using mine on the side, you know, so until we get his fixed and on the road, because he's ex military and he just got home and his. We have to get. You know, he was going to go to [LOCATION], but he decided not to. So now we have to get permanent tags for, you know, his car being out of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and all that. And then plus getting brake lights, headlights fixed and all that. And yeah, he's starting a new job and everything. So I got you. So it sounds like you got a lot of your plate, huh? Yeah, I got a lot of my plates. You know, I'm living by myself in a one bedroom to having my son move in with me, [DATE_INTERVAL] and sleeping on the couch. So, yeah, that's why I said maybe about [DURATION] [DURATION], you know, and hopefully that Murano for the [DATE_INTERVAL] is still there, but we're also open Saturdays as well. How's your weekend? Look, I work, but that's the thing. I work on the weekends, so I'm from [TIME] to [TIME]. There's. I don't have time to go to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] right now, you know. Okay. So it's gonna be about [DURATION] [DURATION]. I. I would say maybe about [DURATION] [DURATION]. I would say maybe, you know, [DURATION]. Maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] that I can get out there. So we're bringing my [DATE]. What do you think? Maybe like next in [DURATION] [DURATION] from now on the [DATE]? I don't know. What is your name? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. How about if I give you a call once I get like, the stuff taken care of and everything? And how much was that [DATE_INTERVAL] again? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. And that's for the one with the 3100. With the 3199 miles. Yes. 38, 000. Wow. And with the no down payment. Because I don't have the down payment. My payments are right now that I put [MONEY_AMOUNT] on mine. I'm paying [MONEY_AMOUNT] auto. Draft it out of my account every month. Okay. And how much? I have the advantage. It was about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I got you. Yeah. Down payment. I'll definitely still try to help you out. I mean, can we go to the same bank that I have now? That bank is it. I'm honestly at the top of my head. I don't know. But I have. Let's see here. Hold on. Let me see if I can find it here on my phone. I know it. Just gotta find the thing that says [ORGANIZATION]. You go to the beginning. Did you buy it at a [ORGANIZATION] dealership? Oh, yeah, the one in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay, well then most likely. I mean, all the dealerships use the same banks, so most likely we do use the bank in house. Where is my. Hold on, let me see that Spectrum. Where is my [ORGANIZATION]? That's Netflix. Android. I have an app that for [ORGANIZATION]. I know I do because I've seen it. You said it was [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [LOCATION]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Got it. [PERSON_NAME] [LOCATION]. Okay, there it is. In a. In. In [LOCATION] or something like that. There it is. Oh, that's [LOCATION]. Yes. So most likely with [ORGANIZATION], if you've kept good standings with them, they will finance you again. Yeah, ever since I got that thing, ever since I got it, my first payment has been auto paid and I have not missed a payment, never been late, nothing. Okay, well then, yeah, you have a good chance of getting approved then. Most of the time, people who use [ORGANIZATION] and they've made their payments on time. I've had people with, you know, lower credit scores than what she told me still pay [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] they still got approved, so. So the chances are pretty good there. Yeah, we can get all the details for your payoff and stuff when you can come in. You said that was [MONEY_AMOUNT], though. Yes, but I mean, if you look at. What if you're looking at, like. I mean, who's to say the car will still be here in [DURATION] [DURATION], you know? Yeah. Let me get in here. Okay. I. I have to figure this out here anyways, so. Yeah. What were you trying to figure out? I was trying to get into my, my [ORGANIZATION] thing. I'm. I don't know what I did wrong. Yeah, I don't know what I did wrong here to get into that, but my credit score was like [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] back then. See here, who do y' all go through? Y' all go through like [ORGANIZATION] or do y' all go through the other one? They use all. All three. I'm not sure [ORGANIZATION] uses. But, like, we can work all that out when you get here. I'm pretty sure we can work something out. It's just a matter of you've been able to get here. Yeah. So did you. Because I know, I know the, like, my experience is like [MONEY_AMOUNT] or something like that. Yeah, I mean, like I said, we'll work all that out when you get here. If you've been paying your bills and time with [ORGANIZATION], then we should be able to work something out with you. That's the, that's the downfall that I have right now is at the time that I had my income tax. At the time I had all the savings that I had, and I put $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down. And at this point right now, you know, of course, you know, this time I was actually paid for work. And then my. I have another vehicle to [LOCATION]. The transmission went out. He bought another transmission for it. So there blew my savings. So I don't have a down payment, but I don't want my payments to go up too much. Yeah. Like I said, when you come in. We'll work everything out. So I mean, you said [DURATION] [DURATION]? About [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]? I would say about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. Can I set something up for what? Like not this weekend, but next weekend and then we can just. I'll follow up with you. We can play it by ear. Let me see her. See, [DATE] [DATE]. Yeah, the [DATE] would be [DATE] [DATE] would be. Not this Saturday, but next. Like I said, I work on the weekend. Oh, that's right. Okay. Yeah. And I'm off only on Wednesday and Thursdays, so it's, you know, right now it's just a bad timing for me to go in there with my car. So it's gonna have to be. It's going to have to be released around [DATE] [DATE] or [DATE]. If I can't get in sooner than that, I will. Okay. I really do like, I do like that kind of car with them, you know, the Murano. Yeah. You know, for me. Yeah. You got a lot more elbow room and you got the six of them. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And I'm, I'm not, you know, I'm not over beat big time, but. But I'm, you know, I got a big ass and so I, I didn't have a choice, which I'm glad that I had the Rogue and got approved for a brand new car because I've never had it done for me before, but I had they. That was the only car that I was eligible for or approved for at that. Now you're in a better spot. My low spike, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I got my credit score up and everything. I've had no, no late payments. Not whatsoever. And I paid whatever I needed to pay and I still have a warranty. Nice. So let's do this. Put you down for the [DATE] at like, what, [TIME]? Just to kind of put a time in there. I'll put it for [TIME]. I know it might not be that time. Something might come up. Maybe you can come in earlier, but I'll go ahead and text you from my cell. That way you have my direct number and you can just, we can communicate there. If you decide to come in earlier, you can just shoot me a text and I'm always here. I'm off Thursdays, but either way, if you come in a Thursday, I can still arrange for another [OCCUPATION]. Yeah, I don't like bothering people on their [DURATION] off. So the [DATE] is fine if, you know, that works. It should be more at ease at that time. It's just stressful right now because it was my son's car, you know, with all that going on and him moving back. And then he ended up getting pulled over in his car, got it [INJURY] and got put in jail. Got caught with a dab. You know those [DRUG] [DRUG] dabs. Yeah. Now he's got a felony, you know, and he had. He had to pay or get money out of his account to pay for his. To get it out his object [INJURY] that same [DURATION]. And yeah, he just got back. Yeah, he got pulled over because he had a faulty headlight [DURATION] [DURATION] brake light out. First time getting pulled over like that. And he was nervous. So the [OCCUPATION] hurts this car. So he even had probable cause. Huh. That's crazy. Yeah. So. Yeah, right now it's sitting in these door, dashing in my car right at this moment. So it's just really hard to. That's hard to get you up here, I understand. Yeah, no, I get it, man. I get you. So we'll play it by ear. I put you down for then the [DATE] at [TIME] it can be later. I mean, that's. And write down the kind of car that I want. Yeah, I'll put a little note. You know, I know. I'll put all the details in the system. So even if for some reason I'm not here that [DURATION] or you come in on my [DURATION] off or something, the guy who works you will still have that in the system to go by. But yeah, I'll text you for myself as well, [PERSON_NAME]. And hey, I'm looking forward to helping you out in the near future. All right, me too. All right. Thank you this time. Have a good night.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How could I direct your call? Yeah, could you connect me with somebody and sale them? Interested in talking to somebody about a Hornet? Give me one moment. At [TIME] I call [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Did you say your name was [PERSON_NAME]? Oh, yes, sorry about that. My phone's a little shoddy. That's okay, I'm a mic too, so that makes it real simple. Listen, [PERSON_NAME], we're in the market for buying the [MARITAL_STATUS] a new vehicle. It'd be cash sale, no trade. And we were interested in a [ORGANIZATION] Hornet and actually [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] like right close to the house. We went there and they go, we don't have any in stock yet. And I'm going, well, what's the use of having all these advertisements out if you don't have any in stock? So I've done business with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] before. I've probably bought three trucks from you guys and some other [ORGANIZATION] Intrepids and whatever. Do you guys have any awareness in stock for that? We had one and it sold yesterday from what I gather. I've been asking my, my new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] the same thing. Looks like they've been held up due to transport. Like, like a lot of vehicles recently have. So it's not that they're not built, it's just they're not able to be transported yet just because they're waiting on trucks. So I, and I know, I've seen all the advertisements, all that good stuff. So it's basically all the dealerships are going to go from like 1 or 2 or 0 to like, you know, 15 or 20 in the matter of probably a month or so. Because once they find transport, all the owners that are built are going to hit the market. Now what. While I got you on the phone, hopefully you'll be able to answer some questions. What, what platform? Because I know they just didn't make a whole new vehicle. Is this like built on one of the little [ORGANIZATION] platforms or what? No, [ORGANIZATION]. It's coming from [ORGANIZATION] fees. Okay, so what about parts availability if it's a [ORGANIZATION]? That's one of the things, you know, we were looking at some vehicles, we ruled a lot of vehicles out because we don't like CVT's. You know, we've got bad, bad experience and know a bunch of people that had bad experiences with CVT's. So one of the things that attracted us to the Hornet is because it's got an automatic transmission. So the parts are. You got, Are you guys having Supply chain challenges with your [ORGANIZATION] platforms that I'd have to get to the [ORGANIZATION] store because there's a different bill loop there, there's others, which is a [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], and then there's a [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I don't know what they're experiencing because obviously they're in [LOCATION] and they're separate. But that's a good question. That's an excellent question. And I'd have, I'd have you ask one of them so that way they can. Because I have no idea. But the, I know the uconnect and stuff, that's, that's, you know, we don't want to buy anything that's a [OCCUPATION] experiment in the first year. So, I mean, the fact that it's built on a phot platform doesn't rule it out, but I mean, you don't want to buy something that is going to have problems getting parts for it. But if it's a, if it's a [ORGANIZATION] Hornet, I would expect [ORGANIZATION] to be stocking the parts at the [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION]. Right, yeah, that's actually true because, yeah, the [ORGANIZATION] Renegade is actually [ORGANIZATION] also and that we have Renegade parts. So. Yeah, I would say you're most likely right. Yeah. Okay. I'll tell you what, let me give you my number and when you guys have some [ORGANIZATION], because obviously the first thing we need to do is make sure my beautiful bride's only like [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. Right. So we need to make sure that it fits. That's the first order of the day. Does the vehicle fit? Because a lot of vehicles, you can't see over the dashboard even with the seat jacked up. So, so we, we put her in the thing and let her adjust it up and make sure she's comfortable with it and then take it for a little drive and then we can talk about colors and options and all that. So if I give you my number, can you give me a call when you get some in? Oh, 100%. Yep. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and we're probably, you know, unless we get some Smoke and Deal of the century because of its [EVENT] [EVENT], you know, I'd say that our purchase time frame is probably within the next month, if not earlier. So as soon as you guys get some in, give us a call. Now, once we decide on something, if you don't have exactly what we want, we don't mind waiting for it. We just want to be able to take advantage of any sales or rebates or whatever. Like I said, it would be a no trade, cash sale. So that's. That's something, you know, you might be able to work on for us. But anyhow, if you give me a call when you get some in, we'll come down and look at them. Perfect. I'll make a note here. Yeah, I'll keep asking and seeing if there's any updated eta, and. Yeah, we'll let you know. Absolutely. And then let me get. I'm taking some notes here, [PERSON_NAME]. What's your last name, [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] All right. Like [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] back in the old days of [LOCATION]. There you go. What do you. [PERSON_NAME] owned Mikayo's, and he also owned the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], which is not there anymore, but [ORGANIZATION] is still around, but his name was [PERSON_NAME] also, so. All right, well, if we call back, I'll make sure to ask for you, and if you give me a call, you get some in, we'll run down there and take a look at them with you. Perfect, perfect. All right, I'll make some notes here, and yeah, hopefully I'm. I'll be in touch with you soon. All right. Hey, thanks for your time. Oh, no problem. Thank you.

One second. Yep, bye. Sorry, [PERSON_NAME]. Just waiting for my phone transfer program to load. Logging in, and there we go. One second. Hello, this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, [PERSON_NAME]. This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I purchased a few cars from you in the past. Yeah, yeah. How are you, [PERSON_NAME]? Good, good. Hey, got a question for you. My car was in an accident, and the insurance company wants to claim my car as a total loss. Okay. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is when I talked to the collision center, they gave me an estimate on what the cost was to repair the vehicle. And then they said that that percentage was like 85% of what the vehicle's price would be, which, when I do the calculation, they're saying that my vehicle would. Which is a [DATE_INTERVAL] Accord, would only be worth, like $[MONEY_AMOUNT], which, I mean, that's like, ridiculously low. So what I'm trying to figure out is if you guys were to, let's say, purchase that vehicle in, you know, it's in good condition at like [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles on it, what would you guys pay for? I'm trying to get, like, a fair market assessment on the car because obviously, [MONEY_AMOUNT], you can't even get a Civic for that price right now, so. Right. I'm trying to figure out. I'm trying to figure out what a. What a value is that I can go back with because obviously I'm gonna have to negotiate this because the insurance is. I mean, $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's not. That's not a fair market value. Right, right. So I. I can definitely take a look. The problem with. With that is they. They don't use what we use, which is awful. I've been in the situation about, you know, 100 times with customers, and I can provide something for you. Let me. Do you mind? Which Accord was it? Yeah, it was [DATE_INTERVAL] sports special edition. Okay, Give me one second. Let me just pull this up for you. Yeah, What I'm looking at is, like, obviously the market value a lot higher than that. But you guys at a. If you were to purchase from me. You wouldn't purchase it from me at the market value. Right. So you would make money on it. So that's what I'm about is, you know, if you were to purchase that vehicle from me, what does that cost look like? And then I can have kind of a stance as to. I mean, a [OCCUPATION] would give me more than that. Doesn't make. Doesn't make sense, like. No, I, I understand that. Let me just see here. I'm trying to pull up your file. Yep. That's the [DATE_INTERVAL] accord, right? Yeah. Is. How much do you owe on the vehicle? Are they going to cover that? No, they won't cover what I owe on the vehicle. Did you, did you get gap insurance? It was through their insurance. So I don't know. Can I go back to my insurance and get gap insurance? I don't know how well that works. No, not after. So I always recommend on purchase, every single one of my customers purchase gap insurance through the insurance company. It won't cover your loan. It will just cover the entirety of the vehicle. So, you know, next time it stinks. But like, I always put gap insurance for this reason. You know what I mean now, because you wouldn't even have to worry, like, yeah, if I did gap insurance. I guess if I had it through my insurance company, I'd have to put a claim in there to do the balance, I guess. I don't know how that would all work, but. Correct.

He left a message saying that he was going to discuss some [EVENT] incentives or something that going on. Yeah, yeah. Here, let me transfer you here to my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] here. His name is [PERSON_NAME] also. So here. Bear with me, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. Someone just transferred me to you. I was calling in regards to some of the [EVENT] [EVENT] incentives. Yeah, of course. How can I help you with that? Well, someone had gave us a call back. I believe his name. I'm thinking his name was [PERSON_NAME], but the other guy said maybe it was [PERSON_NAME]. He said he wanted to discuss some incentive that you guys are having going on this week, I reckon. And I was just calling. Yeah, I guess the other guy just trusted me to you to be able to talk about that. Yeah. So. Yeah, it must have been [PERSON_NAME]. He is, you know, he's the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] here and I am, you know, one of his [OCCUPATION]. But yeah, we are having ton sales, so we are having trade in assistance and then some vehicles have rebates as well. So that's a little extra cash that can help towards, you know, a down payment and lowering the price. Okay. Okay. And on the, on the estate, are there any incentives for those? Yeah, so those, the, for the [DATE_INTERVAL], for the [DATE_INTERVAL], you have the open trade assistance and then, and then they have really low rates. So they have [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] and [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, and are those new? Those are new or used. These are new escapes. If you're interested in a used escape, you know, we'll work out, you know, we'll discount any used vehicle as much as we can, you know, to try to make a deal as well. Okay. Yeah, because I know she got pre approved and I just bought a truck from there as well. So we were, you know, we're just trying to get an idea of, you know, what is available and what the incentives are. We will be coming down there before the, before the, you know, the incentive program is over with. But the [OCCUPATION] that they have on us, we can at least take a look and see what, you know, you know, work out some things and see what is available. Yeah, definitely. I know as well. Let me see if there's anything. It looks like there's also some bonus cash as well for the escape. So, you know, we can discount, you know, an Escape $[MONEY_AMOUNT] as well. Okay, and do you have any that have like a tote that comes with the tow package? I'm not too sure on the tow packages. Usually the escapes don't really come with it because they don't have much towing capabilities. Okay, that's good to know. Besides the trucks, are There any other SUVs that might have a tow package that comes with it? Yeah, so the Explorers have tow packages. Those ones are having really good incentives. So that 1 has 0% for [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] and [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [DURATION] [DURATION], as well as the trading assistance and $[MONEY_AMOUNT] of bonus cash. But the escapes are starting at what about [MONEY_AMOUNT] something? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The escapes are. They start around [MONEY_AMOUNT] you was talking about. Yeah, the explorers though, those ones are going to be a little bit more. Those are going to be starting at [MONEY_AMOUNT], you know, go well up to the [MONEY_AMOUNT], just depending on all the, all the options you select. Okay. Okay. All right, well, thank you. We will be down there to get a closer look and I, I know that, you know, she. We are interested in something that has a CO package on it. So it might, you know, it might have to be an explorer. What you know, comes with it. But we will be down there. And you're. What was your name again? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. You said you were working with [PERSON_NAME], correct? I believe so. He's the one that has been calling and leaving us messages. We've already been pre approved, so we were just trying to, you know, get a better idea of what's there. I'm sorry, I missed your name.

I'm not the [OCCUPATION] on it. I'm not too sure exactly what was going on. I can. I can talk to my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and see if he's got any idea of where that one was assigned and where it's going, but as of right now, according to the stories and what's going on, status wise, I'm not seeing really any kind of updates, any major updates at least.

And, you know, part of it is to get a loner. And when I talked to [PERSON_NAME] last [DURATION], he said, well, we can possibly arrange for a loaner once we get it diagnosed. Diagnosis.

I'll give it to you here. Okay. Yeah. Okay. It's [PHONE_NUMBER]. Thank you. You're welcome. What's that? That's [ORGANIZATION] service. Yes. Thank you, sir. You're very welcome. Have a great day.

"Thanks for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME]. I live up in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION], and I was hoping to speak with someone about a potential lease. Yeah, what can I help you with? Let me tell you my situation, and we may be premature early, but I'm trying to get ahead because I'm aware of some of the inventory issues. I have a company lease kind of allowance or sort of figure that my company will provide for a vehicle lease, and it's expiring in [DATE_INTERVAL]. And I'm going ahead and kind of looking at my options moving forward. And I wanted to get a ballpark, recognizing that it's hard to know what the inventory situation is, incentives and all that. But I have kind of a key is you're not going to know your programs until [DATE_INTERVAL]. If you're not going to do anything until [DATE_INTERVAL], all of the lease numbers and information that you're gathering now is going to be incorrect. Components. [DATE_INTERVAL]. Because your lease programs change month to month, you're actually going to have a completely different model year of vehicle when you purchase in [DATE_INTERVAL]. I don't have any 24s here right now. By the time [DATE_INTERVAL] rolls around, you're going to have nothing but 24s. It's going to be very tricky, especially if you're looking for, like, a Santa Fe, because the Santa Fe is changing body styles. Do you know what vehicle you're actually thinking about leasing? Yeah, the Palisade. Yeah. I mean, it's going to be very difficult to get an idea because the MSRP is definitely going to change on the palisade for the [DATE_INTERVAL] model year. The Telluride went up like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] last year. [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] are the same company. The wild thing is [ORGANIZATION] actually changed body styles for the Palisade, and it didn't go up by like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So I can get you. Like, it's weird because I don't have a Palisade. You're going to probably want a calligraphy. Is that correct? Potentially. I mean, I'd like to see. I've got kind of number parameters, [MONEY_AMOUNT] figures, and I'd like to get an ide. How likely I'm going to be able to fit within that budget, which, recognizing it's hard to forecast because the MSRP could change or what have you. What down payment in miles are you looking for? It'd probably be either 3,000 or 3,500. Okay. And as far as miles, I guess 36,000 over [DURATION] [DURATION] is standard, I'll tell you that on my company vehicle I have right now, I've driven it for nearly [DURATION] [DURATION] and I've got 16,000 miles on it's 10, 12 or 15 if you only need 10,000. 10,000 miles. Only do 10,000 miles. That payment go from [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] down to about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, so. So without. So that would be. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] would be fine. Okay, let me do this. I will put a lease quote together just to give you a rough idea of what would happen if you were to do something. Now do not set these numbers in concrete. Understood. And do me a favor. Do one for both the calligraphy and then do one for kind of a lower trim package, but one that would still have like leather seating. I don't like the base package or whatever, but something kind of a mid level package. It's not going to change as a ton, but I'll do that. You would want to go. I would go SEL premium. Actually, I'd just go sel. That way you get the lowest price point. I think that changes it from like a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] to a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] at least. Monthly payment and a lease. And I'll put that together for you too. If I have one in stock, that's hit a key. I can't build a lease unless I have the vehicle in inventory because the programs stick to the vin and I can't pull the programs if I don't have a VIN that's actually in stock. Okay, so [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What's your first name? [PERSON_NAME]. Last name? [PERSON_NAME]. What's your zip code? [LOCATION]. That's going to be tricky. What's your cell phone number? [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay, what brought you to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Why did you call us? Because we're in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] north of you. There's seven car dealerships. There's seven [ORGANIZATION] dealerships. Between me and you, I was wondering a certain website, [ORGANIZATION]. I googled [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], the one here on [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. I've asked somebody to help me out. He doesn't seem to be super interested or helpful. It kind of sucks because the numbers I'm giving you are like going to be so dark. Different than what happens when you actually go to do this. Well, so let me ask you. I will do it. Yep. So right now I'm driving a [ORGANIZATION] XT6 that I got [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. The agreed value is [MONEY_AMOUNT], which I would anticipate should be around the MSRP of what we're looking at for here. And my monthly payment that is $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So when you're saying three figures versus four figures, what kind of what justifies the big. You're going to be over $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Like, I'll put the lease together, but we're [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] over msrp. Your leases are nowhere near what they were [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. You got to understand your standard interest rate is now 8.5%. As to where it was 3.25 [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Yeah, I mean, I'll go ahead and I don't want you to waste your time. If it's going to be four figures, that's. That's not going to be something that's going to be workable anyway. So I don't want you to spend time on something that won't be worthwhile. I'll still text you a quote just so you have it in writing and you can see it that way because I have a feeling you're going to be caught off guard. And I deal with a lot with people with leases. It is a totally different world than it was [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. And it is really trying when it comes to leases right now, so. Gotcha. And that's why I almost didn't want to do this. Because come [DATE_INTERVAL], that could be a totally different ballgame. We could have rates could be better, the residuals could not be. They're really good right now because all the [ORGANIZATION] hold their value like crazy. But [ORGANIZATION] doesn't have to incentivize these cars. They're all selling before they leave. So there's no. It's not a fantastic lease because the car so sought after, they don't have to incentivize, they don't have to do any perks. They're just all selling before they get here, so. Got it. As for like an XT6, there's probably 20 on the lot. You know what I mean? But I'll still put it in writing, show it to you just so that you have it. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. I appreciate it. Cool, man. All right. Rock and roll. Thanks.",success,price_quote,Palisade,medium,True,0653ab65e1014f9a9ebbb4c4cad14e56_transcript.json

When I opted not to buy more, they told me it would be written up in the deal that I get one over here in bed. I talked to somebody, a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] or somebody like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago in your office. And I have the text from the [OCCUPATION], in his words. And I have his phone number from your dealership, [PERSON_NAME], saying that it was written up in the deal and to get one. Nobody's called me back.

Okay, thank you. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Yeah, [PERSON_NAME], I bought a new RAV4 new to me with 4,000 miles on it and [PERSON_NAME] from your dealership there. And when I opted out of the key fob replacement, but then when he went to give them to me, he only had one. So he told me it was written up in the deal that when I got my service done over here in [LOCATION] that I could get a key fob. So I called somebody when I went to get my first service about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, talked to a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] over there. I thought a gentleman. I gave him the phone number. I have the text from the [OCCUPATION]. And he was supposed to look into it. If it's been [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], I haven't heard anything back, so I just feel like I'm being ignored or like maybe you guys aren't going to make good on the promise. So. A little let down. Yeah. I need only one key fob. I would. I would have purchased the key fob replacement had I known they were giving me one at the end of the deal. There was only one. I have this number. I have it in writing. No, it's worth getting a [OCCUPATION]. But it was supposed to be written up in the deal. It doesn't look like you purchased the wrap from us here in [LOCATION]. I didn't. I purchased it from you guys in [PERSON_NAME], but I thought he act like it was the same dealership. No, you have to communicate with us, and I haven't heard anything about it, so I would, if I were you, reach out to whoever you talk to in [PERSON_NAME] and say, hey, can you call [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], and I can give you my direct line and have him talk to me. And if he tells me, I have his number, too. I mean, I have the [OCCUPATION] phone, but I have his text. I got it in writing. I don't know why it's such a hard deal for me to get. Always bought new Chevys and they always took care of me. This is the first time I bought a new [ORGANIZATION], and I don't feel too excited about how I'm being treated. Right. This is the second new car I bought from you guys, and I usually buy them cash down. So it's a shame that I got to do all the running around legwork on this and that you guys treated me like that. That's all I got to say. Well, I apologize. Yeah, I mean. I mean, it's okay. It's just the way it is these days. People don't take care of you anymore. Yeah. This is customer service now. They lie to you, they tell you, promise you things. And I've already talked to a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] over there. He never got back to me. And have it in writing. All right. Take off the car.

[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], exactly How may I direct your call? I was sitting here laughing because I think I confused that woman because I was like, how's your [ORGANIZATION] thing work? But anyhow, my question is, how. How does that work? Because, I mean, I heard numerous things about it. Like, for people with bad credit or no credit, how does it work? Okay, we've got several different banks that we work with. Were you trading a vehicle in at all or what? Had you looking for [PHONE_NUMBER]? I would not be trading [PHONE_NUMBER] in, but I do have, like, maybe like a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down payment. Okay. Was there a certain type of vehicle you were looking for? You know, either like, some type of little car or a little SUV and nothing that's like, outrageous price. I ain't even trying to do that. Oh, I understand. We've got several different vehicles to choose from. Now, we prefer that you come in and try some vehicles out, because when we send in to the bank, we do have to send in on a specific vehicle. Do you have some time this afternoon or this evening to come by and take a look at some different options and see what you think? The thing is, I don't have a ride. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I don't want to get up there and not be able to get a vehicle. You know what I'm saying? Right. Okay. Yeah.

And if for some reason it's not an suv, would you be open to. To a smaller vehicle, like a car? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. All right. What is. What is. Like, the price ranges, and they vary widely. We've got inventory here in between 17 other stores. So really we've got a wide variety. Was there a certain Range you were trying to keep your payments at? Yeah, I mean, I don't want nothing like outrageous, you know. Okay, what's like maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] that you're comfortable with? Like between [MONEY_AMOUNT] and [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Did it matter if the vehicle was manual or automatic transmission? It don't matter. I can drive either or either [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay. I just wanted to double check. Some people can and some people can't. So. Yeah, we've got several different vehicles. He'll just have to take a look and we can see what we can get you worked out on. What was your name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And your last name?

Right here on the outside of that limbs down here towards [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION] area. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So, okay. I mean, I know what my credit score is because I looked on that credit karma. I mean, it's not the greatest. It's like [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. So I don't know, you know, if they could do anything with that or if they couldn't. Okay. Yeah, he can take a look and see. We've got several different [OCCUPATION] we work with. Some of them work with bad or building credit. So he can take a look and see what we can get worked out for you. And then will you be available the rest of the [DURATION] to reach you back or is [PHONE_NUMBER] time better than another? I will be, but the thing is, my [MARITAL_STATUS], I would have to at least be with her at least by like [TIME] or [TIME]. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, I'll let him know that. And then I've got 2, [PHONE_NUMBER]. Did you want me to send that application to you by text or by email? Do text, because I'm easier at texting than emailing. Okay. All right. Okay, well, I'll get that right over to you. If you could just text me back and let me know once you've you finished filling that out. Okay. Okay. Like, could you go online, look at your options or. No, it's. See, it's going to be at the discretion of the bank. As far as financing goes. We've got, like I said, several different banks. We've got several different vehicles to choose from, so. But it's just going to be up to them what they would do or not do. Okay. You know how long it normally takes to get the answer, or it just. It varies. Hopefully it won't be too long.

Do you happen to have a stock number associated with that so I can make sure? Yeah. Cool. Yeah, Give me one second. Hold on.

So we're about [DURATION] [DURATION] away from you. So I'm hoping to try and work out a deal so that all that's really left to do is come in and sign papers. I don't want to spend [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] going back and forth in the dealership. I like them so I'm hoping to get down closer to like see what we can do as far as getting down closer to like the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] mark. Okay, cool. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So [MONEY_AMOUNT] out the door or [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus tax title fees. I'm just trying to get closer to that number so that I can make sure that the whole thing is done in cash. Gotcha. So you want to do cash? Yeah, the cash purchase. And I know we are asking [MONEY_AMOUNT], so that's quite a bit off the vehicle. I'm not sure if that's what we have within the vehicle itself, but I'd be more than happy to send over our [ORGANIZATION] select showing our number on the vehicle. Does that make sense? Yeah, I mean, definitely. If you should take it to your [OCCUPATION]. Yeah, be my pleasure. Because obviously, like, he's going to know, like, what he can and can't do for that. Totally.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME]. Is this [PERSON_NAME]? This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I am the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] here. [PERSON_NAME] told me that you'd be calling. Yeah. Hey. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. Hi there. Yeah, hey, [PERSON_NAME]. We are looking to get a EV and are contemplating between a baseline [ORGANIZATION] model. Yes. And ID4. So wanted to check if there are any leasing offers on ID4 that are currently available in your inventory. So wanted to check. Yeah, go ahead. Yes. Yeah. So we do have a lease special for our [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] going on right now. It's actually right outside of my office. Right here I'm looking at is a ID4S, which is the 62 kilowatt battery ID4. It's a [MONEY_AMOUNT] MSRP and it's a [MONEY_AMOUNT] lease special. So it's now, if you prefer the Pro 82 kilowatt, we do have. So we have several S's in stock and we have several Pros in stock that are all the same MSRP right there at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So a [MONEY_AMOUNT] lease payment. So, you know, pending, of course, you know, good credit and all that good stuff. So. But do you have any kind of discounts on your [DATE_INTERVAL] models? So we do have two 2022s that are on have recalls on them right now. So they are in stock but not available at the moment. They're waiting for parts to be fixed. But the discounting that we're doing on these ones right here are going to be equal to what we would do on [DATE_INTERVAL] for our [DATE_INTERVAL] sale for a [DATE_INTERVAL]. So when you say [MONEY_AMOUNT], are you talking? I mean, can you help me? Can you elaborate on that? When you say [MONEY_AMOUNT], what more do you need to know? We're talking about a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] vehicle. So. But I wouldn't expect for you to buy this vehicle or any vehicle without sitting in it, smelling it, driving it, making sure everything meets and exceeds your expectations. So like I said, every trim level is different, but this one's got all the amenities of a Pro S but at a Pro price because it's got the 62 kilowatt battery. So now if you prefer the 82 kilowatt battery with more range, I've got plenty of those in stock as well. So definitely need to make sure you understand the difference between a Pro and an S so you can make an informed decision. Can you come out here this evening so I can show you or does tomorrow work better for you? Today might not be possible. I'll try to look up my schedule and then probably come by tomorrow. Fantastic.

"[ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] speaking. This [PERSON_NAME], you say this is [PERSON_NAME]? Yes, sir. Yeah, this [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. You've been emailing back and forth my [MARITAL_STATUS] on the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yes, sir. And I think I just got another. Okay, yeah, gotcha. What's going on? Probably. Well, is the factory warranty still good on that car, the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, sir. There's only 18,000 miles on it. It's only, what, [DURATION] [DURATION] old? I don't know exactly what [ORGANIZATION] warranty is. Manufacturing warranty is. I can look it up and I can find out. But assuming that the Warranty extends past 18,000 miles in [DURATION] [DURATION], then the answer would be yes. Well, I mean, I know it's 36,000 [DURATION] [DURATION], 36,000 on the basic, and then you got the drive train that goes, I think, to [DURATION] [DURATION]. We do not void any warranties on vehicles. So as long as the warranty hasn't been voided by, you know, a previous owner, which it doesn't look like it has, then it should still be available. Absolutely. Okay. That's what I need to know. And I know you probably hadn't had time to read her email that she just sent you. The reason we're looking at the Explorer is because any car that we have to buy, I've got to sit in it and make sure I fit. I'm [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE], [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. So, you know, it's one of them deals that, you know, I don't know how big a guy you are, but you gotta. You gotta check it before you can even think about buying one. Or you. I understand. [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. We do have six. That was. That was gonna be my other option. If we. If we can't get you in something else on our lot that you're interested in. If you still want to reconsider the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], by all means. It's still available, you know, still here. Perfect. If that's not the case, if you're looking for something 4x4, the best option that we have for you as far as like a [ORGANIZATION] would probably be the. It's gonna be okay. You know, it's gonna be big. It'll fit you. Just depends on how you like it at that point. Yes, sir. Okay. Now my next problem is on the. On the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Still is. It'll be like Saturday. Are you still. You gonna be there Saturday afternoon? I will, sir. Okay. We're driving from. We live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION], which is out here by [LOCATION]. Okay. We're [DURATION] [DURATION] away. I Don't want to have. I don't want to drive all that way and then that that sucker be gone when we get there and not have a chance to look at it, I guess is what I'm saying. But I guess you can. But you can't guarantee that it will be there, I guess until we leave here Saturday morning. Right. I can't guarantee anything. Which is the best, you know, the worst part of my job. The best thing I can do is I can say Friday night before we close, I can shoot you. Yes. Or an email. Let us know. Hey, the vehicle has not been sold. What time are you hoping to come out here on Saturday? Well, she's got. She owns the flower shop, so she doesn't close until [TIME]. So like I say, it'll be [TIME], [TIME] before we get there. If. Is this something that if you drive out here, I mean, you're going to be driving [DURATION] [DURATION]. If the vehicle fits you and it's in good condition and you like it, would you be. Would you be looking to purchase that vehicle? I would, if we can come with within a decent deal, yes, sir. I would drive it home that night. Okay, perfect. So we're working on that. I mean, that's the best I can tell you. I can't promise you I'd buy it up, but you know, just like I can't promise that the car is going to be here. Right, sure. Exactly. That's the case. I wanted to ask that first before I ask you. I can ask if you'd be willing to put a deposit on the vehicle because you live [DURATION] [DURATION] away. I can ask my [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hey, this gentleman wants to purchase this vehicle, he's going to put. Hang on a minute, hang on. I'm having a hard time because I'm outside and there's traffic going in front. Okay, now tell me again what you're saying. I'm sorry. That's okay, sir. I wanted to make sure that you were very interested in this car before I asked you my next question, which is if you'd be willing to put a deposit on the vehicle to hold it until you get out here. A refundable deposit. I can ask my [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] if they'd be willing to extend that. Typically we take deposits for new vehicles, but sometimes we do, in situations like yours, we take them for used vehicles to reserve them for somebody that wants to look at it. But I don't know how they're going to want to go about that. I can ask them about that if that's something you're interested in. No, don't worry about that. If it. If it fails, it wasn't meant to happen anyway. That's kind of the way I look at it. All right, my next question is, and I know you're probably busy, I've got a [ORGANIZATION]. I've got a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Cross tour. The loaded one, the top of the line with navigation and everything that we want to trade. Okay. And it's paid off. It's got 220,000 miles on it. [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Cross Tour. 20K. Yes, sir. Okay. And you're gonna be. You're. You're gonna be bringing that to us? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay. Perfect. Did you. Okay. Awesome. Yeah. Beautiful car. Good stuff. Okay. And I know you think you can't tell me what. What you'd give me for it until you see it, obviously. Yeah. I'm like, oh, let me just go ahead and teleport to you real quick and I'll tell you. Yeah, exactly. I know, I know. I'm not that away. I wouldn't. I wouldn't expect you to. And I would. Even if you told me a quote, I wouldn't hold you to it because I know how to right some place, some people would be, some people be pretty crappy about it and try to hold you to it, so. Well, I appreciate that. Anyway, what I'll tell you is, obviously, you seem like a very informed, informed, knowledgeable buyer, so it looks like you probably already have, you know, your idea of what you're looking to see when you get out here. Yes, sir. Sound like a reasonable person. So I do think that we'll probably be able to make something happen. And as of this vehicle is still available, it has not been. Okay. Saturday is our busiest [DURATION], so definitely get out here as fast as you can, because you never know. Right? I will definitely do that. Do you have my phone numbers that you can call me and let me know? I mean, even if I'm on the road, then you call me and tell me, I'll keep an eye on it [DURATION] [DURATION]. And if I see it sold, you know, while you guys are on your way, I won't make you finish the drive. I'll let you know. Hey, this is sold. You can decide if you want to keep coming out here. We do have other options. We just got a Sequoia Platinum, a new one available today that's on the ground. So worst case scenario, if you want to come out and check out what a Sequoia feels like to you, maybe wouldn't hurt Depending on how far out you are, but we'll deal with that. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I'll keep an eye on the vehicle. If I see that it's sold out here, I'll let you know. Hide it somewhere. I'll do my best, sir. I didn't want to ask for your permission. This. Is that your number? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Do I have your permission to text you? You bet. Sure. Anything. You. You bet. That's not a problem. All righty. I'm not much on texting, but, yes, I'm all thumbs when it comes to texting, but I do it as long as you can read it. When I text you, you can give me a call. Well, yeah, thank goodness for spell check on my end, because sometimes. Sometimes spell check. Donut. Can't even figure out what I'm trying to say. So we're doing good. Big enough for your hands, do they. That's. That's right. Exactly. Well, [PERSON_NAME], I appreciate it, and we'll stay in touch. All right. And, sir, was your name [PERSON_NAME], or is your [MARITAL_STATUS] name? I'm [PERSON_NAME]. My [MARITAL_STATUS]. My [MARITAL_STATUS] name is [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, perfect. So I'm gonna say [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] is our last name. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Absolutely. I'm just putting your names in here. So. I know. So I know. I'm talking to. Okay, we'll see you on Saturday. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much. Yes, sir. Have a good one. All right. Bye.

You're probably going to tell me it's sold, but I still have some questions about it. Well, you know what? I will definitely check for you. Who am I speaking with? Okay, my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And phone number, [PERSON_NAME], in case you and I get disconnected. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Yep. Okay, and then do you have a stock number of the truck that you're looking at, ma' am? Yeah, I'm gonna have to go back to it. Yeah. The reason I ask is there's quite a few of them coming in, so I just want to make sure you and I are on the same page. Right, that's gonna start me all over. Shouldn't have clicked the back button. I hate the way [ORGANIZATION] does this. When you go back on the search, it starts it all over. So. Hang on, I'm gonna have to. Sure. And was it, you know, [ORGANIZATION] Tundra. It's the only one you've got like this. It's [ORGANIZATION] Tundra limited in the hunter green with six. I didn't check, but I. It was trd off road, six and a half foot bed. And I think it's [ORGANIZATION] there. They came back. Hang on. Yeah, here it is. Okay, hang on, I've got it. No, that's at a different tailor. Hang on. Yeah, I gotta search on micro distance. Hold on. So you say it's in the army green. Yes. Okay. Whoops. Okay. That I'm seeing on my. Yeah, let me go to. Let me go to detail. Hang on. Sure. Okay. And I don't see. Come on. Taking its time. I'm g. Give you the vin. That's the only number I can. Yeah, just the last six of the VIN will work fine. Okay. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. I think that's [VEHICLE_ID] I just gave you. Wait a minute. [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID]. Yeah, that's [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay. That doesn't sound familiar at all, but let me see what I can find. You say it is an army green Tundra. Correct. Limited. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] Tundra Limited. Army green with black soft text. You know what size the bed is? Does it tell you? It better be 6.5. That's what I was just going to check. I think it is. Yeah. Six and a half. Okay. And it's definitely got trd off road. And that's about it. I see an army training with a five foot five bed, but I'm not seeing one with a six foot. A six foot bed currently. Oh, it's on your website. Well, I think my questions are going to relate to whether it's a five, five or a six, six, six, five. So. So I've got. It looks like I have two of them. So I have one with a five foot five bed and I have one with a. With a six and a half foot bed. Let me pull that one up here real quick. So it is an Army Green 5 foot CrewMax priced at [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Does that sound correct? Yes, that sounds right. And it's got the trd off road. All right, let's. Let me look at the packages here. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Okay. Okay. My. One of my. Okay, one of my main questions. I was able. I have not seen this exact book. I was able to. The platinum and you know, I know obviously there's some differences, but my questions are what does this tundra, the linokid have in the way of cameras? Because when I The platinum. The platinum has a 360 degree view. This one will definitely have a backup camera, but let me see if there's any additional. But it's got things outside mirrors with multi terrain monitor functionality. I don't know what that is. And I think there's something else. The panoramic view monitor. So I need to know what those are. Panoramic view monitor. Where are you seeing panoramic view monitor at under the list of packages and accessories. PVM + BSM outer mirrors $[MONEY_AMOUNT] PVM + BSM outer mirrors include heated power, outside mirrors, color keyed with blind spot monitor, bsm, panoramic view monitor, PVM and LED turn signals. Yeah, they all have the led. So it's. So what is panoramic view monitor? Monitor. Panoramic view monitor and LE turn signals. So the panoramic view monitor should be. As you're backing up, you're going to see what's behind you and beside you. Okay, so it does include that one where you see like the. If you're in a parking lot, you see the part. Yes, ma' am. According to this package. Okay, that's, that's what I saw in the platinum that I saw which, that's one thing I want you to know. And what about the. Now I'm switching between your windows. Okay. What is the outside mirrors with multi terrain monitor functionality under the TRD off road got little numbers but I can't find anywhere on the webpage that explains those footnotes. So this is going to be an off road package, but it's also going to have. Looks like it's got the camera set up so you can see what's on the ground. So if you're like going over a rock or something, you'd actually get an idea of where the truck is in accordance to. So do you know where? Do you know. So that's on the. I'm flipping back and forth between, I'm trying to search it outside mirrors with that. So that's going to be built into the mirror. So what it's going to be. Yes, ma' am. There'll be little cameras right underneath the side view mirrors that give you that help with that eye view and actually see what's like directly underneath you there. So if you're in like a crawl mode, you put that vehicle in crawl mode and you're going over some stuff, you actually kind of have a view of what you're going over and kind of help you figure out if you need to back up or not. Okay. No, that's good. It's. I, I don't do off roading, but I live four miles up. It's not. Gotcha. So just so you'll know, this vehicle is, is available. Okay. It is an allocated status, which means it's being built, but it's not here yet. And then so you, you do have the option to put a deposit on it and hold it in your name until it arrives. And when is it going to be built? And then after it's built, when do you get it? It's getting built at the end of this month, so on the [DATE]. So usually it takes once it's built, you're looking at about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] for it to arrive at the dealership. Okay, so about [DURATION] [DURATION], A little more? Yeah, a little over [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. And how much deposit do you require? So it's a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit. Your deposit is refundable. We can do that like online for you so you don't actually have to come in for that. That puts your name on the vehicle if you first write a refusal. Once the vehicle arrives, we'd like for you to be here within a [DURATION] [DURATION] period to check it out. And then what we'll do is we'll have you drive it, make sure it's what you thought and if that's the case, then we complete the paperwork. One more question on cameras, the. And again, this is something I saw in the platinum in the back of the cab, not the bed. So up there at the top above the vertical window where it's got the backup light, it had camp a camera or cameras that actually look down into the bed so you could, you know, see your load. Does this have that or not? I don't know if it does. I know the camera it has is going to give you a view. Let me take a look here. I know it's got, it's got the tailgate camera, the rear. I know that I forgot where it is, but it's there somewhere. Yeah, well it's got the. Yeah, but that's the backup camera. Right, but I'm not talking about the backup camera. I'm talking about a camera that looks down into the bed from the back of the cab. Yes, ma' am. And that I'm not, I'm not certain of. I'm taking a look here. So one thing you can do too, that really helps you is you can look at. It says how panoramic view monitor and multi terrain monitor work. [ORGANIZATION]. That's on YouTube. So you would type in panoramic view camera. YouTube is going to bring up a lot of videos and it's going to let you see it. So nice thing about that is it just shows you the camera and I'll send you a link to that, to that video. So you can just click on the link and look at the video. That's great. That would be good. Yeah, yeah. The multi terrain is showing you what's directly in front of you and beside you as you're going down something that's rough. So you're getting an idea of what you're. What you're approaching. So okay. Oh, I see right here I just pulled up panoramic view and multi train and it's a site. So. Okay, I'll just watch that and do some searching. On the other I will send you a link to the panoramic view monitor. This one is a specific video about the panoramic camera and the off road camera, multi terrain camera. And again I don't know if that actually show you the rear bed of the truck but it gives you about every other view. Yeah, but I'll. I'm looking at the video now so it looks like it's very informative. I'm going to send you an equipment sheet of the truck. So it's going to, it's going to be a. Just an overview of the equipment on the truck and this video. But what I would ask you to do is once you see these, if you could get to me, back to me as soon as you can. Yeah, it looks like you're able to see your view, your bed truck as well. Your truck bed as well. That's nice. But I will send you those if you like what you see. The only thing I would say is please call me back right away and let me know like hey, I'd like to move forward and put a deposit on that vehicle because you know things tend to sell around here. We have [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and we have, you know, we have three states surrounding us for everybody shopping and too because we actually have one of the best selections of trucks in the area. Okay, sounds good. I'll get that information out to you right away, ma' am. Perfect, thanks. Bye.

And what's your name? I'm sorry, it's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. All righty. Thank you. Hey, are you still there? I'm here, yes. Alrighty. Sorry about that. It took me a little bit longer than I expected. So we do have a customer on that car right now. So she was just waiting to see where the customer is at in the process on that car to see if they want the car or not and then was going to give you a call. Okay. I'm also interested in a new Jetta as well. Okay, perfect. So let me just transfer you over to her. Well, actually, I don't know if she's. She was at her desk. Was there a specific trim level that you were looking at? I. I was kind of looking at. Let me see here. Let me go to it. Sorry. We did just get a [DATE_INTERVAL] Jetta S in. That's like right around [DATE_INTERVAL]. I didn't know if that might spark your interest. I was trying to stay around that. That price. You said it's a Jetta. What base model? S. Okay, [DATE_INTERVAL]. Let me see here. I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get there. Yeah, so I would be. I'm interested in that. Okay. I'm interested in it all the way up to like 25,000 total. We've got a good amount of those. Yeah. Okay, let me transfer you over to her now. She just came back to her desk and I'll let her know. Or. Well, okay, I'll let her know as well. Okay. What's your extension? He's also interested in a new car. Anywhere from. So we did just get that Jetta s in. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, did [PERSON_NAME] give you a little bit of the lowdown? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. All right, good. Yeah, I was just waiting for them to finish up to make sure that this vehicle, you know, we didn't get any because I had numbers worked up and then the customer came in. I didn't want to call and promise anything. And then it fell from. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, I, I get it. So I'm obviously, I'm interested in the Passat, but I am also interested, interested in a new Jetta as well. I'm trying to stay around [MONEY_AMOUNT] or less if I can, but the main, main thing was I was just trying to see if I could get approved. Yeah. So actually, fun fact. Well, not fun fact. Good news. We can get you approved on a vehicle. We were able to get you approved on the Passat, you know, until it, you know, is no longer available. But we do have Jettas within your price range to look over. Okay, so I was looking at that Jetta S that you had. What kind of interior does it have? Because when I look in a photo, it kind of looks like leather, but if it's a base model, I don't think it'd be leather. Correct. Do you have the stock on that one by chance? Yeah, I got it pulled up. Let me see, where is it at? Okay. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. All right, give me just a second here. And is this a new one? It says it's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, it's new. Yep. I do have the vent as well. And real quick, could you repeat the stock real quick? You said [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Okay, so let me look real quick because that one might not yet be on our lot. Give me one moment here to log into our system. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, so that one we're not looking to get until mid next month and it's the black cloth interior. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah, I put him a photo. I couldn't tell, but it might just be a generic photo, so. Yeah, but which one do you actually have in. So I do believe I'll have to double check on it because I know my [OCCUPATION] was talking about it this morning. We do have a Jetta Sport that's on the lot. That should be within your price range. Let me double check though. Yeah, so we should have a Jetta Sport automatic that's here on our lot. In that one you're looking at [MONEY_AMOUNT] on. But let me also check what else we may have. Oh, it actually looks like. Oh, give me one moment here. It looks like we did just get in a [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] Jetta s. This one, it is white with the black cloth interior as well. And this one we have priced at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And it's automatic. Let me double check. Yes, that is an automatic. Yep. So this one, it's the automatic. Would you be having the time today to stop in and take a look at it by chance? I think I. Yeah. Okay. Did you tell me, I know you said I got free, I got approved or pre approved or whatever. Do you. You probably don't know what a, like a payment and interest rate would be on that, right? Not on that one. Like I said, my [OCCUPATION] had printed me out one for the Passat, you know, so we had you approved on that and we had some, you know, paperwork worked up that, you know, depending on how much you're looking to put down and everything. So I had that. But I wouldn't have like the rate or anything on this Jetta at this time. Okay, so let's see if I come in, do I ask for you then? Yeah, if you're able to stop in, let them know that you talked with [PERSON_NAME] and they can definitely come grab me. I can get you all settled in and have a [OCCUPATION] get that car ready for you. Okay, sounds good. I got a. I'm on my way home. I just got to talk to my [MARITAL_STATUS] and then I may head up there. Okay, yeah, sounds good. Just feel free. Like I said, tell them that you spoke with me and we'll get you all sorted. Okay, sounds good. Thank you. You're welcome. Take care, [PERSON_NAME]. Bye. Bye.",success,general_inquiry,Jetta,medium,False,06e52db351de4c5590fd6111bead6475_transcript.json

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] &[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [LOCATION] largest [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] boat dealership and a [LOCATION] family owned business since [DATE_INTERVAL]. If you know your party's extension, you may dial it now. This phone call may be recorded for quality purposes to reach a member of our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. To look up an extension by first name. Otherwise, to schedule an appointment with service, press [PHONE_NUMBER]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I direct your call? [PERSON_NAME], I'm sorry, you're cutting out a little bit. Could you repeat that? Sure. Can you hear me now? Yeah, I just missed a call from [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, I'll send you through to her. One moment. Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Who am I speaking with? Hi. Hello. Can you hear me? I can hear you. Who am I speaking with? I didn't realize my ringer was off. That was my fault. Sorry, I totally missed your call. Okay, so what did you want to ask me? I'm so sorry, It's. I'm having a little trouble hearing you where I sit. One second. Be with me. Okay. Now can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Is this [PERSON_NAME]? Yes, it is. Oh, hi. Thanks for calling me. Yeah, no, I just wanted to make sure, with the different units we have that we're looking at stuff that's within your budget. Okay. So I just wanted to make sure. Were you thinking of making payments like most of our customers or. Well, so our house went on the market like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, and it's sold and it's on contingent. All these words are new to me. So it's on contingent that the other people's house sells. So I want to pay it just outright. I don't want to have to do payments. Okay, so you want to do cash? Yeah. Okay. Did you have a budget in mind? Because, you know, you're kind of looking between toy haulers and fifth wheels. Like some of those, even some of the used ones can go up to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh, yeah, I know. Yeah. So I want to make sure. We're looking to show you the ones that are. Ones that you can afford. So. So he's back to. Okay, hold on. He's back to where? Him meaning, my friend, the ones that we can drive and put the car in the back, like hook it onto the back. Oh, so you're looking at motorhomes now, too? Yes. Okay, no more. Because I don't want to have to buy a truck and I don't have a truck. Okay. We also have trucks, too, because when it comes to the motorhomes, those are usually more expensive than the trailers and trucks combined. Yeah, yeah. So I just want to make sure we're working within your budget and that we're just getting you with the right options. We also have trucks, too. It might make it a little bit easier for you, but we can definitely look at some of our motorhomes. But those, usually, once you get into the motor home category, those can go up to, like, [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It kind of depends on which size you're looking to. I've seen some that are up and up to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh, yeah, I know. Like, the promise. Well, I mean, let's see. Even, like, the used ones, like, somebody, you know, like, they wanted to upgrade or whatever. And because we've seen some online, and they're pretty nice. And of course, they're not new by any means. I mean, we seen one like [DATE_INTERVAL], and then we also seen some that were like [DATE_INTERVAL] or whatever. So. Yeah, we just want to get, like, an idea. My whole thing is I told them, I said, I know what to look for. Like, because I had bought [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. It was a, I, I. I tasked a sunrise. It was an older one, and there was one owner, and it belonged to her mom, and it was in excellent condition. I said, but yet again, you buy it for somebody else, and let's just say the air conditioner goes out. You can't be like, oh, well, [PERSON_NAME], air conditioner went out. And he'll be like, well, sorry. It was, you know, sold as is. And that's it know, versus if I go through a [OCCUPATION], I could say, hey, well, [PERSON_NAME], this quit working. So, you know, what are my options? I'm so sorry. You, you cut out again. I'm so sorry. I am so sick. I hate t mobile. And I'm outside. Okay. Maybe where I was at was better. Okay. Now can you hear me? I can hear you. It just every now and then. Yeah. It cuts in and out. Or else it's so fuzzy, I can't make out what you're saying. Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm not in the house anymore. And then. Yeah. So just versus, like, I was telling them a dealership. Like, if, like, if something goes out, at least I could say, well, you know, [PERSON_NAME] just went out on it. You know, what are my options? Yeah, you know, versus buying a private owner. Yeah, no, that's one of the things about us too, actually have our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], so we work on. Yeah, we get a lot of people even People who didn't buy from us coming to us to get things fixed. But I just want to kind of go back a little bit just because I need to find some options that will work for you. There's different types of motorhomes. Are you looking at the ones that are the size of a bus, like a class A or something in between? Class A. Yeah. Because we're probably going to be living in it for a while. Okay. I know you said you were in a. You had a wheelchair as well. Most of the motorhomes usually aren't set up for wheelchairs. Is that going to be okay for you? Yeah, I'm just going to have to leave my. Because my sister lives in [LOCATION]. So I could probably just leave my wheelchair over there. And then, you know, because I have one I could. That really. That collapses and then I have one that doesn't, and I'll just probably take the one that collapses them with me. So. Okay. Usually they only have, like steps to get into the unit. Yes. No, no. I'm able to walk. I just can't if it's a long distance, I have to be in a wheelchair. Okay, Gotcha. Gotcha. And then I didn't hear what your budget was again, because I would only. I would like to not waste your time and showing you stuff that's out of your budget. Yeah, you kind of. Look, I'm not. I mean, I don't. I want to say it was at least [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I mean, do you think I'll be able to find something? Okay. Around [MONEY_AMOUNT] is what you look. So if it was a little bit more than [MONEY_AMOUNT], would you still want us to show you that one? It is not too much over it. Yeah. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. And then did you have anything that you currently own that you wanted to bring in on trade? No. No. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. So you have kind of like that [MONEY_AMOUNT] cash budget. Looking at the Class A motorhomes, did you want to also look at some of the other options? I know you were looking at different things. Maybe see which ones work for you in your budget. Sure, sure, we could. And then maybe it'd be lower to get something that I have to haul and just invest in a truck. I don't know. Yeah. So I thought I'd explain a little bit too. I'm only part of our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] because we get so much stuff online, our [OCCUPATION] or [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] can't keep up with it. So I'm actually going to set you up. I was going to set you up with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. But I think I'm going to find somebody who's kind of well rounded in all the different units, and I'll shoot you a text. That's what you'll ask for when you do come into the store. When you get to the front desk, just ask for them. That's why I wanted to find out a little bit more specifics for them to make it easier because you, you know, they're the experts, but, you know, I could tell them you're looking at class A's, but he'd be like, wait, but like, if I Show him the [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] unit, like, is that going to waste their time? So that's why I wanted to make sure what your budget was. So we don't do that. I mean, if you want to look at them. Yeah, but we don't want you to fall in love with something and then be upset. Yeah, no, we're not about that. You know, we want to earn your business and we don't want you to be, like, upset with us for doing something like that. Okay, I will. Let's see if there's anything else. I know you don't have a truck, but maybe my [OCCUPATION] can talk about some of the trucks we have and maybe go over the pros and cons of motorhomes and the trailers and see which one might work best with you as well. Just kind of with your needs and wants and what might actually be best for your budget. Because you said you just sold your house, right? Yeah. Okay, so we're hoping to close [DATE] [DATE], but that's still up in the air, so. Okay. Okay. And was it just you and [PERSON_NAME] using this or was it. Yeah, just me and [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, just me and [PERSON_NAME]. And then I have a question now once, like, say if we do buy one from you guys, is there a way, like, like, they teach him, like, about the gray water and all that stuff in a class because he doesn't know anything. Yeah, no, we definitely. We make sure people are well prepared for the units. We talk about all sorts of stuff. And, you know, we also got like our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and all that other stuff, and they will be able to talk to you about that things and also the type of work we can do for you because we are part of, like, different systems to help you get certain things fixed. But I would rather have my [OCCUPATION] explain all that because he knows more of the details or they know more of the details than I do. So at this point, I think it really is just having you kind of sit down with them and show you a couple of options and talk about how it would work with your budget. So that way, you know, you're just well informed on what decision you make. Because I know, like right now it seems like you're looking at like all sorts of different things. So we at least want to show you what the cost might be for some of these and what we provide as well, just to make it a little easier for you. Yeah. For 15, I think it's either going to be a guy, [PERSON_NAME], or a guy named [PERSON_NAME]. They are with customers right now, but they're my more well rounded people. As soon as I get a hold of one of them, I'll figure out who's going to be available at that time. And if they're not, then they will recommend somebody who is also well rounded. I just know those guys personally. And we'll get you set up with someone who can help you out. But you know, I thank you so much for answering the phone. Oh, no problem. Yeah, I know it's kind of a little stressful situation right now, but we'll see what we can do to help you out and if we can find anything. Okay. We don't have anything in [LOCATION]. We do have four other locations, but one for billings. There's another. We have a sister store in [LOCATION] as well. So we might try to see if we can't find anything at the store. We might look into our other inventories as well. If you are interested in any of the other locations and seeing what we can do, that's fine. Also, what was I going to say? Oh, and they know that I need accommodations as far as getting around a lot and stuff. I'm sorry, could you repeat that one? No, it's not you. It's just a stupid. I just. They know about. I need accommodations like getting around the lot. The. You know, I heard around the lot. Yeah, golf cart or whatever. Yeah, we always take people on golf carts because our lot's pretty big, so automatically you'll always be putting off cart. You'll have to. We might even be able to just bring the golf cart out to whichever exit is closest to you and go from there. But yes, I was going to let you know, but already take everybody on golf carts anyways. Unless it's like right in front of the building. So. No, we have all that. We also take those to go look at things. So. Awesome. Yeah, I will text you as soon as I get a hold of [PERSON_NAME].

[PERSON_NAME] know it's a feature of your cars, Hyundai's, that when you're on a slope and parked, the E brake kicks in. It's also a feature of the cars that when you're on said slope and the E brake's on if for Any reason you cannot drive away in any gear. Oh yeah, [PERSON_NAME] think [PERSON_NAME] talked to you earlier this morning. Yeah, you had called. Yeah, yeah, [ORGANIZATION] and they don't have an answer either and they're not willing to escalate it. But this is a safety concern. People need to be able to get away. And the seatbelt, I'm just trying to figure out if is there a way to override it? And she couldn't find it. Have you looked in the owner's manual to see if there's a way to turn that off? In the owner's manual? Yeah, she looked it in the owner's manual herself. We had a [DURATION] [DURATION] conversation. [PERSON_NAME] was in my car doing it. With the owner's manual as well as the display, there's no option. And she said they're not willing to escalate it. So my next step is [PERSON_NAME] have a Contact with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to go and highlight all of these issues because [ORGANIZATION] just completely shut the idea and concept that this could be a safety hazard. And yet it clearly I'm not sure if there's anything that [PERSON_NAME] is going to be able to do on that because that's, you know, is a design issue. And you guys, the [ORGANIZATION] did just say, well what's that? [ORGANIZATION] told me to call you guys today. So [PERSON_NAME] called you. [PERSON_NAME] talked to you earlier, called [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] said we're not doing anything. It's the way the car is designed. She just put herself on repeat, wouldn't answer the question and wouldn't acknowledge that this is a safety issue or anything and said that [PERSON_NAME] needed to call the local dealership then to see if there's any way that they could turn it off at the dealership. She said because it's safety thing with the E brake, the [ORGANIZATION]. Well, let me do this. Let me get your name and number. Let me go talk to our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and see if he knows if there's a way to turn it off. [PERSON_NAME] like that. [PERSON_NAME] know [PERSON_NAME] have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Santa Fe myself and [PERSON_NAME] have the same thing. You know, you got to put the seatbelt on for to do it.

Is it someone I can speak to about my application? Okay, hold on one. One second. I'm just turning on my computers. I'm just trying to. Give me one second to find out who. Who you were speaking with. Yeah, we're just getting in. I just. Yes, ma' am. I'm sorry. I just kind of want to be first in line because I was away. I know other people probably are too, but I have to go to work this afternoon. But I also had another question. I brought somebody. Well, somebody that's forgiving me. I was telling them about the deal and I was trying to see if it's too late for him to get a ticket. Oh, that I know of. No. Let me see. Are y' all looking for pre owned or new for himself? I don't know about him. He. I was just telling. I've been telling him about the deal but then he just didn't know because he, he, he. His job is an [ORGANIZATION] and so he knows if his check stuff would be okay because I know it's like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] and that kind of stuff. So he didn't think that that was going to be valid. But that's okay because [ORGANIZATION] is a. A job. Right? I'm not sure how it goes. It looks like you probably spoke to. Let me see.

Okay, my other question was about the other ticket, because I know that you all only were doing [TIME]. Well, that's what it said on Facebook. So the person that's bringing me, they wanted to see about submitting the application, maybe. Is it too late to do that? Do that for the zero down?

Nope, that is fan mail. Disregard those. That is fan mail. Okay, so I don't have to get a warranty on my car? No, your car already had the manufacturer warranty on there. I mean, you only had the car what, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]? Yeah. So is it best for me to go ahead and get a warranty on my car so when that one expire? Way to agree. Expire. What's the sense of paying for something when you already got warranty on it? Okay, but I don't know when it's going to expire. How many miles you got on it? 2,000 or something odd miles. You figure you still. Well in your [DURATION] [DURATION] of 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty and way well into your [DURATION] [DURATION] or 60,000 mile powertrain warranty. Yeah, somebody done tow up my car already. So it's in the shop. So yeah, it's in the shop now, but I'm back and forth to [LOCATION]. So do you every day. So do you think that I'm gonna go over the warranty within [DURATION] [DURATION]? Nope. And not only that, let's see here. Your car, your car also came with the lifetime powertrain warranty. So as long as you keep the maintenance up on it, I wouldn't even worry about the powertrain warranty. That's transmission and engine. Okay. All right. Oh yeah, I'm gonna keep the maintenance up on my car. You definitely do that. Okay. I was just making sure because it just kept coming in the mail and I'm like, if you asking for my bin number and stuff, like, why is this. Yeah, that's. That's a spam mail. I mean, I still get them for a CRV I haven't owned in [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah, they was like, oh, this is for your new car. This is this for the car you just purchased.

Well, I was wondering if I can turn that car back in. What happened? I'm only kidding, [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, I was gonna say, because you never know. I mean, I guess you've had calls like that before. Probably. Well, I mean, hey, I mean, it's. It's. It's retail business that. Those are things that we do have to deal with. It's funny because we have people call in [DURATION] [DURATION] after they bought the car, wanting to turn it back in, and we're like, yeah, yeah. I'm like, that's not exactly how this works. Well, I've had that happen in my business, too. Yeah. And, you know, I'm in the magazine business, and people are. Now for [DURATION] [DURATION], you know, it's [DURATION] [DURATION] contract, and they want to undo it. Yeah. You just. I mean, just people in general. And literally, I just say what you just said. Well, it don't kind of work like that. Yeah, it's, you know, in our magazine. Two of them. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Do you think my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] could get there to see you about it? Well, I don't think, because we have. Because [ORGANIZATION] is kind of corporate now. He's got so many dealerships. The person you really want to talk to is actually probably [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. He's the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] for the whole. And where does he work at? So his office is really here in [LOCATION]. It's at the separate building down the hill. But he. I know he's. Since he's the [OCCUPATION], he kind of moves around everywhere. I always say best. Best way to reach him really is by email. I. I'll be happy to give it to you if you like. Sure. Hold on one second. Set something up. Okay, I'm ready. Okay. It is [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [PERSON_NAME], right? [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS].

Yes, sir, that's right. Okay. And that automobile, it's not auto, it's automotive. Automotive, right. Not plural. How come there's such a. On that ra, that 500? There seems like to be very few of them available. Yeah, well, I think. Well, it. Because it's the. The kind of. The flagship version of the rx usually like the top of the line cars. They. They don't build a lot because majority of the clientele looking for just a regular premium package ones. The hybrid is also. The hybrid portion of it is also an issue just because it takes 50% more microchips to build those. And microchip still an issue. So they're just. Oh, I thought they had solved that. Yeah, I mean, it's gotten a little better. I wouldn't say it's solved. I think there were. There. Were there. I think. I don't think there are rumors anymore. I think they're planning on building a plant down, I want to say in the [LOCATION] area to build more microchips. But that's, you know, that. I think that decision was made last year. So it's still going to be a [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] process before the factory's up and running. Right. So I think until then the issue still. It's funny because when they were talking about it, they're like, oh, how do we solve this microchip issue? Okay, let's build it. Let's build a factory so we can build more microchips. And everybody's on board. Like, oh, yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. And then they realize in order to build microchips, all the machinery that needed to build these microchips required microchips to build these microchips. So they're like, oh, God, they got stumped again, you know. Yeah. So. But I think the plan there and you know, it's just. Just trying to get it back. I think it's just resources now, you know, more than anything. You know, with [MEDICAL_CONDITION] and everything that affected production line, I think that turned the whole world upside down, actually. Yeah. It's crazy, right? So I don't. I don't know again. Right. It's the new normal. Well, labor seems to be the big deal now. Right. Yeah. I mean, from What I heard, 1.7 people for every job. Yeah. That's nice. You know, we're fortunate. Unemployment rates at 3.4. I mean. Yeah. I don't know what the answer is. It's really. I think we just stopped having babies is one of the reasons. Yeah, maybe. I mean, family size, a lot of people just don't do it anymore. Yeah, I get it. Yeah. I mean. I mean, I have two little ones and I mean, shoot, I love. I can't afford them. Yeah, I. I can't. I can't afford them. I don't have time for them. You know, it'd be. It wouldn't be fair to them. So it is what it is. Yeah, that's right. Well, good speaking with you. Absolutely.

I'm doing good, man. Can you help me maybe check out a truck, price something out for me? Yeah, what you got? Well, I'll give you a little background. So I'm actually supposed to be picking up a truck tomorrow, but it came in and I'm not thrilled with it from a different dealership. And I saw this truck, man, and it's really kind of what I'm really looking for. And so I'm taking one last swing. It might not happen. It might happen, but maybe you can take maybe help me out a little bit and take a look at it. What was wrong with the truck that came in? What was it a [ORGANIZATION]? Yeah, it was [ORGANIZATION]. Yup, it was [ORGANIZATION] 1500. It was RST. It had everything and I actually built it on the [ORGANIZATION] website. Got it. It came in, it didn't have. It had a power adjust for a power adjustable driver's seat but not the passenger, which is kind of weird to me. I thought I was getting the Z71 package and it wasn't. And so just kind of things like that that are kind of turning. That kind of turned me off.

If we crush some numbers, I mean that'd be. That'd be cool. Are you looking to just straight purchase it or. We. It'd be at least, you know, [DURATION] [DURATION] or whatever makes the most sense. [DURATION] [DURATION], 10,000 miles. [DURATION] [DURATION], 10K. And then with the quote, do you want what down payment are you looking to see it with? Probably like [MONEY_AMOUNT].

Okay, if I pull it up, does it mess with anything with it? No, I'm not going to submit it. I'm just going to pull it up, make sure it says [ORGANIZATION] so I can quote you correctly. Right, right, right. Let me see. Yeah, it does say [ORGANIZATION] on the side of it, but yeah, it says UMS [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay, I'm just going to look. Oh yeah, you're good. And then your name is [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, Yep. Okay. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Got it. Okay, so we're good there. Not submitting it. I'm just. I just wanted to make sure we were good there. Okay. Yep. Okay. [DURATION] [DURATION], 10k current lease in the household. So we'll have lease loyalty incentives, which is good. And next step from you. I need the VIN of your lease, your current lease, the vin, the exact miles and then the exterior condition. If you want to text that to me. Yeah, let's just get a text going here.

I wrote down everything. Got it fresh. Yep. [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID]. And accurate condition. What do you need on a scale of 1 to 10 type thing? Yeah, just, you know, if there's anything going on with it. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] appraisals, normally we're always taking a risk with a site unseen appraisal. So yeah, I would say it's probably like an [TIME]. [TIME] to [TIME]. [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. Okay. All right. And then I'll verify that he is still on that truck for a demo and see what if it's here. It's here. But I did see him leave yesterday and I believe it was in that exact truck, so.

So I'm wondering if [PERSON_NAME] [ORGANIZATION] has any of those on their lot and if not, if they want to buy one. Yeah, we would love, I mean, when can she bring it over? Or we need, we're on our way to the [ORGANIZATION] dealership in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] right now. There's, there's two of them and I know she's going to the one with the autonation. I think there's two of them over there. She's going down there now for them to look at it where, where the car was purchased. So I live, I live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. I work in [LOCATION]. She wouldn't be, she wouldn't be bringing it over probably for another couple weekends. Yeah, but we want to get a price because [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], they give you prices and like I said, we're going to take it to a dealership right now to have them look at it. If I give you the VIN number of the car, you can look that up and have somebody call back. And this car, let me tell you, she just had it serviced the regular scheduled service because he bought an extra, extra super duper warranty maintenance package on this car. He paid over $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for the car with tax. Okay. And it's, it's got [ORGANIZATION] speakers and it's top of the line. It's all leather. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] Avalon night something or another. Do you, are, are you the man to talk to or do you got to go through somebody else? You want the VIN number? Sure. I mean, again, I mean we, I mean if you're going to bring it around, right, I mean, up to you, that's, that's, that' your end. But if, no, she's not going to bring it over just for you to look at it. And low ballers, he's not going to drive. It'd be 500 mile, it'd be 300 miles one way just to bring it over there for you to eyeball it. If you don't have an Avalon on your lot and your [OCCUPATION] would like to have one on his lot. Can we just, can I just talk to the [OCCUPATION]? Huh? No, no problem, no problem. Hang on.

I was trying to read the odometer. Once she took it in for service, it had 14,000. Want to just say 200. And that's about what it has right now because she. They keep it in the garage. Now, this car has. It's my sister. This is only her third time driving the car. And there's no kids, there's no animals, no pets. In fact, he's got a brand new cover for it in the trunk that he never took out of the box. I want to give you the VIN number. And I'm going to give you an opportunity because I'm just thinking [LOCATION]. She might get more money for it than going downtown. Where she's on her way to right now. [LOCATION] to a [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION]. So the vehicle VIN number is. You ready? I'm ready. All right. The number [VEHICLE_ID], the [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID]. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. [VEHICLE_ID]. That's the VIN number. She has a clear title. She also has the last will and testament she has. He doesn't need to know all that certificate. I'm letting him know he's dealing with a clean title. There's no mess here. Yeah, is what I'm trying to let him paid for. That's all you need to know, is it? I'm gonna give you the phone and let her talk. There you go. Okay. This is [LOCATION]. Hi, I'm [PERSON_NAME]. I'm the [MARITAL_STATUS] of my [MARITAL_STATUS] [PERSON_NAME]. He already. He already knows all that. So let him ask questions now. Okay, [PERSON_NAME], first and foremost, let me Say, I'm sorry for your loss. I know it's not easy to lose family member, let alone your [MARITAL_STATUS]. So I am sorry to hear that. Thank you. One question I have for you is, is it only [PERSON_NAME] name that is on the title of the vehicle? Yes. Okay. All right. The reason that I ask, and this will not matter where you sell your vehicle, whether it be here or whether it be with somebody else, because he's the only person that's on the title, you will more than likely need to just show a death certificate in order to be able to sell that vehicle. I just wanted to just give you that information. Okay. Right. I had to go through this with my father [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] back, and it was tough. Right. If somebody had told me that up front, then it would have made things a little easier for me. Right. Thank you for that. Yes, of course. And then it sounds like, are you. Are you in [LOCATION] at the moment? Is that where you're located and that's where you're living? Yeah, I live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], which is about 30 miles north of [LOCATION]. And I'm driving in the car, actually, over to the [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] right now to give them an option to buy it. But if they don't give me what I'm looking for, you know, gonna take it somewhere else and sell it, you know. But I know what was paid for. I know how good of a shape it is in. And it's only got 14,100 and whatever miles on it, and it's been kept in the garage, and it's even got a cover for it. I mean, it's an impeccable shade. It even smells new still. It does. It actually does still smell new. Okay. So I figured I could drive it to [LOCATION] and see my sister, see what you guys might do if they don't take over here. Absolutely. And if you don't mind me asking. Right. Because the last thing that I would want you to do is to drive all the way over here. And then, you know, that's a long drive to make. Right. So I get it. What are you trying to sell it for? What's your asking price? Well, I know that I can get $[MONEY_AMOUNT] outright. Outright putting this vehicle out on the street. I know I can get that. That's what I would like. Now, if anybody's willing to barter with me or talk to me and say, you know what, sounds like a fair price, I'll take it. Great. There's more that comes with the car. So, you know, that's what I would like, if someone wanted to entertain me with a very slight lower number, I might consider it just to be done with it. But [MONEY_AMOUNT] is my asking price. Okay. All right. And the reason I wanted to ask, like I said, you know, I recognize that you know that the drive here is a considerable drive. Even if you're coming to see friends and family, it's still a drive. I've done it numerous times. I know the drive. I'm her sister and I live in [LOCATION]. So she was going to come over eventually. Yeah. Okay. Thank you for that. Thank you for that consideration. Of course. So why don't we. Why don't I do this? What is the best number for me to give you a call back? Right. I need to do my due diligence on my side, so that way I can get a value. And I'd love to call you back. It'd probably take me about maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] or so. That's cool. My phone number. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay, fantastic. And it's going to be [DURATION] [DURATION] before I get to the [ORGANIZATION] place, so, I mean, you've got time and I. Well, go ahead. The only thing I was going to say is what we do know, the [OCCUPATION] that sold the car to her [MARITAL_STATUS], she just got off the phone with him. He says, well, there's two people here in the position to be able to make an offer. And I can tell you there's no Avalons on our lot right now, so they might be interested. Well, it's a hybrid and it's. They don't make them anymore. Yeah, we'll know all that when he gets the Venture. Okay. Okay. And what is your room? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Could you also send a text message to her mobile phone and she'll respond so, you know you've got somebody legitimate here and the right number. Absolutely, I will do that right now. I'm going to just. I'm just going to send you a text message direct from my. My mobile phone as well. Okay. Okay. And when you. And just so that you know, [PERSON_NAME], when you take the checklist and you want to know, does this car have this, that and the other. It had everything on it when I got the car Service for its 15,000mile service at 14,000miles. And the guy only had to check one button, and that was because they have [ORGANIZATION] speakers. So it's got everything, all the bells, all the whistles. And you have the original. Whatever that was. Inventory invoice. Yes, that we got. All right, so he's got the gist of it. All right. Thank you. I have all that. No problem. I will talk to you very soon. Thank you for your compassion and likewise, sorry for your loss. We. We both have lost our. Both of our parents. So we. We know what you're going through. And it's not fun. It's not easy. Well, thank you for that. I appreciate it. So, text message is on the way, and I will give you a call back here shortly. Thank you, sir. Bye. Bye. You're welcome. Bye. Bye.",success,trade_in_mentioned,Avalon,medium,True,074eea68803c4297a9b60626cd157a75_transcript.json

"Yeah, I got a question. My son has been communicating with somebody there about buying a car, the, the [ORGANIZATION] XLE that you have. And I was just wanting to get some ideas about. Yeah, sure, can't help you. Yeah, I was calling. My son has been talking to somebody there about a. A purchasing a [ORGANIZATION] XLE that y' all have. Yes. And I was just wanting to get some facts before we drive up there. Basically hoping to see what it would cost once we were out the door with it or whatever. If I give you some information, can you help me out with that? Say what now? What kind of information you gonna give me? You talking about some. Which. Well, I've got, I've got his credit score and I know what his down payment is going to be. I know how many [DURATION] he wants to finance it. I'm just wanting to find out, you know, finance rate and then again, you know, add ons and all that kind of stuff. But it's going to cost. Okay. Okay. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. His name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. He's been communicating with somebody there. He's flying in from [LOCATION] this weekend. And so if he's trying to make a decision between several different cars. Let me see who he's talking to. Make sure, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He says your name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. What's his name? His name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, I see if it's in that one. Thank you. Need a remote. It. I know we communicated with him yesterday by email and I think maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] before that. Oh yeah, I'm trying to get in here. Beautiful backing up. I understand it. Okay, now just ask me the questions that you want, really. What you want about this car, what you need to. What you want to know? Just tell me what you want to know. Well, I'm just trying to figure out what it's going to cost, you know, once we're finished with everything. So the car is the car out there. It's like [MONEY_AMOUNT], right. But you gotta add, you know, so. But what they add to it is [MONEY_AMOUNT] on that [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So it's already [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Whatever it is, it's probably about [MONEY_AMOUNT] then probably with taxes and everything. You'll be probably paying like you know, probably [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it. Okay. Yeah, because you know, it's really the only one we have here and it's a pretty nicely equipped one and it's nicely in a nice looking. But the way I have to do is I'm not, you know, I don't want your credit or not like that right now, you know, trying to give you. I'm. Give you a roundabout figure where it is. It could be less. Now, don't, you know, don't quote me on the price, because it's. Because it's based on, you know, credit, interest rate, stuff like that. So I'm, you know. Well, the car is like, the other day when they talked to him, they told him, I'm looking at. I'm looking at your dealership online right now, and the other day they told him on this car that the finance rate, based on his credit score and money down, he's putting like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down. Credit score, 15. They were saying the finance rate would be 7%, but right now here it says something like 10.17. It just. It just depends on. I guess it was depending on what his credit was. That's what. That's how they determine what. Yeah, I'm saying they told him 7%, and I'm just wondering why it says 10% on here. But anyway, I guess we'll just have to drive up there. I appreciate the time. No. Yeah. So you already worked the deal with somebody on a new car, right, on that [ORGANIZATION] today? Yesterday. Yeah, he did. He talked to somebody about. Let me just. Hold on for one second. Hold on one second, though. Sure. Yeah. You said his name was. First name was [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. Okay, hold on. [DATE_OF_BIRTH], [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. Okay. I think it was. God. Was it [PERSON_NAME]? The guy named [PERSON_NAME] that he works with? That sounds familiar, but I'm not certain. But, yeah, that sounds familiar. Hold on for a second. One sec. You gonna look it up? Okay, thanks. Well, I'm gonna get your phone number. I'm gonna call you all back so I can tell you exactly who it was. Okay. Yeah. And if you want to come up here. And if you want to come up here, my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. You can come up here and holler at me, but I just want to make sure you get hooked up with the right person. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Yeah. All right.

Yeah, this is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Is that how you pronounce that? That's different. Yes, sir. It was a. It was a mess up. How are you doing? Your mother? Well, and. Never mind. I spoke with a woman there, a [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] girl, I think. Who would that be? It depends. On what department was she? Do you know what department she was coming from? [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. I'm trying to see who we have. And you don't have a name, right? I don't. That's. I've lost it. That's what. That's my problem. You don't have anybody like that there. It wasn't. I'm assuming, maybe [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] could be [PERSON_NAME]. Like she's young. Like, I'm talking about, like [PERSON_AGE] [PERSON_AGE].

[PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. When I pulled up your. Your name and number, nothing showed up. Okay. I mean, is there anything I can do to help out? Yeah, there is. There's a guy named [PERSON_NAME] that my [MARITAL_STATUS] talked to. [PERSON_NAME], right? Yep. All right. I'm his [OCCUPATION]. How can I help out? Okay, so you're his [OCCUPATION] and. Yes, sir. You're [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Yes, sir. I have a. I have a problem because [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] is on the other side of the world for me. Okay. I'm. You know where the bridge is on [LOCATION] that goes over. Down to [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? No, sir, I do not. It's called. What the hell bridge is that called? It's trying [LOCATION] [LOCATION], but it's really gone west. And go across the bridge, you go across the [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. And right before you go there, there's a big fountain. And I live in this new development there. Okay. And [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] is out on [LOCATION], right? [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. Yeah, that's the other side of the world. However, you sent my [MARITAL_STATUS] an email to confirm your. Your contact information. And since then, I've been online and looking at inventory, and you have about [DURATION] or four cars that I would be interested in talking to you about. One of them is a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] touring car. And it's got the weirdest VIN number I've ever seen. What is it? [VEHICLE_ID]. [VEHICLE_ID] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [VEHICLE_ID]. I've never seen a VIN number says part that's really the. The stock number for it. That's in the VIN number. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. Here. I'm going to try to pull them up as well. Okay. You said it's a torn, right? It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. Did you have trouble in school with that, [PERSON_NAME]? Why'd you say that? But I've never seen it spelled that way. Honestly, I found out about it when I was [PERSON_AGE], so I didn't even know until later in school. Most of the times when I get like, let's say [OCCUPATION] calls or any commercial calls, they ask for [PERSON_NAME] every time. So I'm just like, yeah, yeah, that's the he. And it throws everyone off. Well, can you imagine having a name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I like it though. Oh, well, yeah, I guess my mom liked it, but same different day. Okay, I found it. I found it. [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hybrid Touring. Yeah, it's a hybrid, huh? Yes, sir. I thought that the hybrids were the hrs, like the HRV's. No, the. The hybrid's just going to be in the crv, the [ORGANIZATION] Accord and that is it on as far as hybrids and then you got the insight and then the clarity. But those are their own categories. All right, so you're at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yes, sir. I've got. What's your phone number again? Mine is. Okay, now that's going to be my cell. Would you like my direct line in here as well? What's the best way to get you? Probably, sometimes. Sometimes. Because sometimes I have blocked. So maybe even maybe the phone line. Here, let me give you the other one. [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay. I'm going to cross your cell phone number out. Okay. I have a trade in that you haven't seen. Correct. Okay. All right, it's. It's an [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Marquis LS and it has a designation of ultimate edition. Yeah, I remember. I do remember talking. Yeah. Yes, I know exactly. Yeah. Okay. Now it appears on. On. What is that called Car fax F A X. Yes, sir. It appraises at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. If you can look at it yourself, I think it's a hell of a lot. Of course I'm. That's my car, so I think it's worth more than that. But that's just normal. Okay, [PERSON_NAME], if I were to come up here and love this [DATE_INTERVAL] CRB touring, which is probably a gray color. Yes, sir. With the VIN number part, we're The. Yes, I know, I know. If I traded in the [ORGANIZATION]. Yes sir to you, to you. I'd have trade in plus cash. But it would be cash out the door OTD. Okay. And that is a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] and that's an ex touring or hybrid? This is a [ORGANIZATION]. Hybrid touring. So it's the top of the line hybrid touring. Okay. Okay. What are you asking for that car? So for this one we're asking [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Oh, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. How many miles are on that? Now this one has 32,414 miles. Now with this car it is an all wheel drive. It's a four cylinder engine. Yes. And what we do with our vehicles is that we put a warranty on it. That's something you don't pay for. It just comes with a vehicle. Right. Because it is a [ORGANIZATION]. This, this would be, this would be my third crv. I know what you're talking about. Okay. Okay. You guys have already purchased with us before. Right. So how much cash out the door would I need for that trade? Well, realistically we would have to take a look at your car first. Right. Let's assume that it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. I know, I know. When you look at it you're going to say it's only worth [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, I know how to. Yeah, not a problem. I know where we're headed. So if we were to assume that it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT], then you're looking about [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And that's the tax. Yeah. Because that's already including the taxes about like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] on top of that. All right. So that, so I'd have to come up with how much case and my car would be [MONEY_AMOUNT] roughly 300. Okay. Now would you like, if you would like I can have my [OCCUPATION] send over through email like a pricing. So you can actually have something that you can take a look at versus something that that is just me, you know, estimating. Okay. No, not, I'm not ready for that yet. So that car is going to cost me [MONEY_AMOUNT] roughly. Yeah. Unless. Unless I tell you all, I'll only give you [MONEY_AMOUNT] and you'll take it. But we haven't gotten to that point yet. Right, Right. Okay. Now there's also a [VEHICLE_ID], [DATE_INTERVAL]. Not sure what it, what it is. It is then number [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] as an excellent [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay, let me look for him. Oh, I forgot to ask you a question about that first one, but that's all right. [VEHICLE_ID]. It's a red one, right? Don't think so. No. Don't like gray. I should be gray again. Gray or silver or [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. She doesn't like red. So it's not showing. It is not showing. Do you have a number that I can use? Pardon me? Do you have a stock number that I can use? No, I looked it up last night and wrote that number down. Okay. Do you know what trim level it is by any chance? I. No, I don't. I should probably get it up on my screen first. My phone, but I. I don't have it. I had [DURATION]. Three vehicles. Four vehicles that you had in your inventory that I thought I might be interested in. Okay. And were they all CRPs? Yeah. Okay, now one was a [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] touring, which we know the most about that. And then there was a [DATE_INTERVAL] who I believe was also a dark gray, metallic gray. Then there was a silver one that the vin ended in [VEHICLE_ID]. It was a [DATE_INTERVAL]. And then there was a [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] one. That would be my last choice. And if I came out there and took your hand and like the way you part your hair or do whatever, you know, we'd be looking at those four cars. Okay. So are all those in the same category? Price wise, they're all going to be about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It will. Realistically, I need to know what the trim levels are because if the trim levels, let's say if they were all [ORGANIZATION] touring, probably not. You know, if they were touring, they would be in the [MONEY_AMOUNT] range. But if they're, let's say, ex, it could be like at [MONEY_AMOUNT] or lower than [MONEY_AMOUNT], depending on mileage. Right. Well, it's mileage and trim level too. Okay. And then there's the lx, right? Yeah. The LX would be the base model, so that one would be cheaper. Do you have any of those laying around there? We should. Give me a second. We have a big selection of them. We have some that we still haven't processed and still need to be detailed and everything. So sometimes they won't even be on the website. So, for example, a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] LX with 46, 000 miles is going to be going for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. So I could probably get something down around [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. And we. Look, here's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] LX with 18,000 miles for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. All right. Now that particular one you just read that right now is a [DURATION] [DURATION] old car, right? The [DATE_INTERVAL]? Yes sir. Yeah, yeah. What's this MSRP? Well, I wouldn't know the MSRP. And to let you know, right now the market for the pre owned vehicles, it's not going to be like it was, you know, [DURATION] ago. So the prices of the pre owned cars have gone up. And this is something that's started well before [DATE_INTERVAL]. It was around like [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yeah, I know, I understand. I've got an Odyssey sitting out here also. I mean I'm a [ORGANIZATION] guy and a [ORGANIZATION] guy for the last [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. So what I found last night to my amazement was the MSRP for a [DURATION] [DURATION] old car which was less my, you know, it's back from a lease that had a limit of [MONEY_AMOUNT], 36. Right? 12 and 12 and 12, 36,000 miles. Right. People don't go over that. There's a custom, too much per mile. So it's back on a, from a [DURATION] [DURATION] lease, but you're selling it now or expect to make it the same as what it cost originally. In other words, that's, that's not computing with me, you know, because it's a [DURATION] [DURATION] old car. No, and I understand, I mean if, okay, so if we took, if we took The XL with [MONEY_AMOUNT] at $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] old, it cost [MONEY_AMOUNT] new [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Why wouldn't I order a new one? Well, I would say you should. Yeah, I should, shouldn't I? Yeah. Because at that point it's going to be a brand new vehicle, let's say, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that you're going to be selling it soon, but it's going to hold its value better than a pre owned one. Okay. They're going to have all the warranties. And now what [ORGANIZATION] is doing that they didn't do before is on the [DATE_INTERVAL] now they're offering a [DURATION] [DURATION], 25,000 mile oil change and power rotation. All right? So I mean that's it and that is if I own it, right? So I can, I could, I could reach in my pocket, all right, and pay you for it and keep it [DURATION] [DURATION] and then give it back to you. And it's not going to be the same later on because nobody's going to want it. It'll all be electric probably. Maybe we don't know. That's the, that's the thing that's throwing the monkey wrench in the, in the works here. The government is. So anyhow, it would be smarter for me to lease a new [DATE_INTERVAL]. Right. Police or purchase, it's. It's whichever way, you know, you feel comfortable. That's really all it is. Because there's benefits to both. I know, but I have to worry about what its value is [DURATION] [DURATION] from now. And I'm establishing its value [DURATION] [DURATION] from now if I lease it and it's totally under warranty because it doesn't even belong to me. Right. Yeah. And then you have the gap insurance in it. So if anything was to happen, you just, you know, you're not in charge of it, you know. Okay, all right, it sounds like that philosophically. Okay. I've taken you down a path. All right. Okay. I want to leave. I want to lease a new [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] for [DURATION] [DURATION] and I want to give you my [ORGANIZATION] and use it for down payment and a couple payments or to bring the amount of the lease down. Okay? Okay. I'm expecting to get [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] out of it because that's what this [OCCUPATION] has, has said it's worth. Okay, we can sit and talk about what it's worth quite a bit. But what you need to know and you don't know is it's only got 54, 000 miles on it. Okay. And you don't want it, but there's, there's someone out there that wants this car. It's beautiful. And it's the same car that all the police cars are and all the taxicabs are. Right. You want to. So my advice at this point now would be this, because you, you have this [OCCUPATION] price, right? And you're probably not going to come off of that price. So my advice really would be to probably sell that on your own to get that full amount, because if we were to buy it for that price, we wouldn't be able to sell it because that's a retail price. Okay. Then it becomes your problem. And, and, but I need to know something for the calculation. Right? Okay. And what would the lease be? The monthly lease for [DURATION] [DURATION] for a new, not a, not a touring car. Well, okay, let's, let's just stick with the tour, the high end. Okay? Okay. Because we, because we got, we got one there that's [DURATION] [DURATION] old and I can buy it for [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Let's just say that we'll change that to a new [DATE_INTERVAL]. Tricked out a [ORGANIZATION] hybrid touring car. Right. Okay, okay, okay. And into. And do my trade in in case. Right. Okay. Out the door, cash out the door. How much cash would that new would be. And how much would be the monthly payment if we leased it for [DURATION] [DURATION]? How's your guys's credit looking? Would you say it's tier one or would you say it's okay? I don't know what you mean. The go ahead because it's also based on credit as well. Oh, hey, listen. You know what a [ORGANIZATION] score is? Yes, sir. Okay. I'm over 800 and so is my [MARITAL_STATUS]. Okay. Yeah. Let's hear one. Okay. I don't know what. I don't know what that means because I don't owe anybody anything. It just means you got good credit. Except for this house. I mean, here. So I pulled up on our lease specials on a [ORGANIZATION] here. Give me a second. So it's not giving me anything for a touring. This is just a theoretical for the sport hybrid. So if with really good credit and $[MONEY_AMOUNT] duet signing, you're looking at around $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] for [DURATION] [DURATION]. And that's just theoretical. Yes, but you're. You know, you're right in the. In the ballpark, it's not going to be twice that amount. And what was. What was the amount if I just come up with a catch that I'd have to go from a [OCCUPATION]. Okay. You know, I got the. The monthly lease is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. But there's also a third calculation and I. I need from you. And what is if I just pay cash for it? I can. I can get that figure for you. I'll get it. Please. All right, well, let me give you a call back. All right. Yes. Is this a good number to give you a call back? Yeah. Okay. Same, same. That's okay. Yep. Okay. Sounds good. Thank. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, sir. Absolutely. Okay. Bye. Bye.

"[ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How are you doing? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm well. How are you? Good, thank you. I'm just on Autotrader at the moment and I'm having a look. You've got a car. [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION]. Do you still have it? A [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] WRX. All right, let me check that for you. Okay, let's see. [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] with 52,000 miles. Yes, sir. Let's see here. I think it's still here. So it may be [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Let's just confirm that. Okay. It says the vehicle is here on the [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Yes, it is here. All right. I have a question. How negotiable are you on that price? On the online price, that's literally our best price. But it's only $[MONEY_AMOUNT] below [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Well, yeah, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] does average national averages. But we go by VIN and market. Market. Market value. That's actually what the market dictates to be. I mean, it's within $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm not. You know, if the difference was bigger, I would say if you find something out there that's lower price, you can send it to us. We'll adjust accordingly. But. But [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is not necessarily what we go by. Okay. My whole. That's similar. You can send it to me and we'll. We'll see what we can do. Okay. I don't have anything similar. My whole entire thing is I'm traveling down from [LOCATION] and I don't want to waste your time, and I don't want to waste my time. Of course not. So what you call it? I'm looking at possibly [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] out the door. Is that something that you can do? No, no, that's too much. Because even if it was [MONEY_AMOUNT], let's say we give you the price that you're seeing on. On. On. Was it. What site were you on? [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. So let's say it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. If you add taxes, it's going to be above that with fees. So, yeah, I don't think we will be there. I can put price together for you to see what the out the door is. Then maybe that will help us have better perspective. Would that help you? That'll help me. Can you do that for me? Of course.

"Calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I just got a call from, I believe she said [LOCATION]. Okay, yeah, right. Yeah, I was gonna say we do have an [LOCATION] that is here. If I could just get your phone number real quick, I can go ahead and get you over to her. Okay, thank you so much. Let me put you on a brief hold real quick and get you over to [LOCATION]. Okay, thanks. Yeah, of course. [PERSON_NAME], it. Good afternoon. Hi, how are you? I'm good, how are you doing, [PERSON_NAME]? I'm good, I'm good. I'm at the airport so it might be a little noisy. No, you're totally fine. I was just trying to reach out to you because I saw you were bringing in your X1 on Wednesday. Is that right? It's the next [TIME]. Yes, next [TIME]. Yes. My apologies. I caught myself as soon as I said it, but I was just reaching out and I'm glad you were able to kind of give me a call back because I know my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] has been looking for more of these X3 models and we saw that you were bringing your [DATE_INTERVAL] in with that really low mileage. So I was just wondering, have you thought about upgrading? Yes and no. I mean, my car's paid for so it's kind of hard to go back to a car payment. Right. So, you know, but it would be nice to have something a little bit newer and more, you know, the technology kind of stuff. So. But I have no idea how much, how much pre owned are these days. I don't want anything bigger and could possibly go a little smaller. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. And I definitely hear kind of the idea of like, you know, it is paid for so it isn't something that you have been thinking about. But I do want to reassure you that trade in values are a lot higher right now just because we're in such high demand for pre owned vehicles. Right, right. Yeah. So that definitely is kind of a reason why I definitely wanted to give you a call because I did see you had that [DATE_INTERVAL] and I was seeing, I was just kind of wanting to see if you were interested in something newer. So it is kind of good to know that you are looking for something. You know, it's a little bit more technology and maybe even a pre owned option with that. Yeah, I would only get, I would only get pre owned. Honestly, I'm getting close to [OCCUPATION] and I, you know, don't need, I don't need a brand new car, so. Yeah, that makes sense to me. Now with that, I know you told me a little bit about how you want to get definitely that higher technology, but is there any other added features that you would definitely want in your next vehicle? No, the main thing is that to be able to look at navigation on the screen. I know, I don't know what the right technology name for it is, but to be able to get [ORGANIZATION] Maps or whatever up on the screen as opposed to looking down at my phone. Yeah, no, definitely getting that navigation system in there. It's definitely kind of helpful in. Definitely. I know it's that. Yeah, it's not necessarily navigation because I know I don't necessarily need navigation. I need to be able to look at. Because my son just recently got pre owned and he's like, well I don't have navigation but I don't need it because I have, you know, the ability to, I guess be able to, you know, to be able to put it up on the screen. Yeah, so that's actually similar to. I know you can do it just by plugging your phone in as well, but kind of that [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay also because you can put that whole map on your screen and just be able to connect it straight from your phone. That's what you're looking for. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, I couldn't get the words out. No, you, you are fine. The more we talked through it, I knew exactly what you were talking about. Yeah, that's definitely something that I know in the newer models does kind of come standard. So I know you said you're definitely looking at pre owned but that is an option for our pre owned vehicles as well. Now I just know with the, with the navigation because my past two BMWs then the navigation goes out of date, you know, and right then that because whatever car I buy I'm going to drive for another [DURATION] [DURATION]. So. Yeah, so that's why the [ORGANIZATION] Play I guess is the way to go. Yeah, and it's definitely a little bit easier too because you can pull it right up on your phone and be able to use it in that, you know, the most updated setting for sure. Now I know we're looking at pre owned options here. Do you have any mile stipulation on what you want to stay under for these pre owned vehicles? Well, I mean I'm only at 75,000 after [DURATION] [DURATION] so I am seeing more miles on it now. But I mean I would want to have the best warranty that I could. And I know once you get over so many miles you kind of lose the length of the warranty. Right, yeah, that makes sense. So definitely something lower than what you're at right now for your current mileage would be kind of reasonable. Is that right? Oh, a lot lower. I wouldn't want to get a car that had 75,000 miles on it. I mean, I wouldn't want to have more than maybe 30. Okay. Yeah, no, that's perfect. I just kind of wanted to get an idea. So we know exactly what you're looking at now. I know. Yeah, I know. It obviously kind of comes down to how much we can offer you for yours. So do you mind telling me a little bit about the condition of your X3 currently and maybe even any packages you might have with it? Well, any of the. Well, shouldn't you be able to look up to see what I have? Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I was just trying to get a little overview. So we don't even have to worry about that. Just maybe kind of the condition that the vehicle's currently in, it's in pretty good condition. It does have some scrapes on the front. The front of it. And I'm bringing it in because someone knocked my side view mirror off. So that's getting fixed this week. Okay. But other than that, I got. I mean, the tire should be good. It drives fine. I really. I haven't had any real problems with it. I have had to had it repaired, which you would be able to, you know, see that if you looked at the VIN number. So. But I mean, it's in good shape. No, that's awesome. That's definitely something that we love to hear, and it definitely sounds like something my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] would be very interested in. So let me ask you, when you come to service on Wednesday, are you waiting with your vehicle or are you dropping it off? I'm dropping it off. Okay. Do you think you would have just about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] to meet with our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] to get a value for your vehicle and kind of be shown some of the options that you may be interested in? The only way I could do that is if I came in earlier. I think my appointment's at [TIME]. Yes, ma' am. It is there for [TIME]. Yeah, I could come in at [TIME]. I just. I have to get to work. So that's my. Yeah, no, that makes my conundrum there. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. It definitely is something. We're open as early as [TIME], so if it is something you just want to come maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] earlier just to speak with us, we certainly can do that for you. Is that something you're interested in. Yeah, I would be interested in that. Okay. I'm not ready to make a decision, so I don't want any hard sell, but I'm just curious what I can get and what you know and what you have available. I know now that you need cars, but I also know that cars are hard to come by, so. Right. It's not necessarily the best time to buy a car, but it's a good time and does sell a car. Yeah. You know, it definitely has its benefits on both sides. But if it is something that you are interested in, which I got a lot of great information for you today, I'm actually just going to go ahead and let my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], [PERSON_NAME], know what you're interested in and kind of what your expectations are through the process. So that way, when you come in, I know you said you have to get to work, we can take care of everything in the most timely manner. Okay. Okay. All right, well, make sure. Just do me a favor. When you come in, let your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] know that you want to speak with [PERSON_NAME], and [PERSON_NAME] our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Okay? Okay, that sounds good. All right. Sounds perfect, [PERSON_NAME]. Well, I have you all set on my end, and we look forward to seeing you on Wednesday. Okay. Okay, sounds great. Thanks so much. No problem at all.

I wish you would talk him into giving up that damn car, because we don't need to. I'm sitting here and he just. He just. He needs to get rid of it. I mean, he could probably sell it, but I just don't. I just don't want to have to fool with it. I hear you. Is it like a project car or something? No, it's not a project car.

But it looks good and it's clean. Good, clean inside. That's not. Worries at all that we. We are actually looking. I was just. Let's see, 14, 15, 16, 17. I was just in a [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] with some friends of mine yesterday. That looked like [PERSON_NAME] thought I wouldn't have bought that car. That was awful. My interior, look, it was terrible. Anyway, it looks a heck of a lot better than that one did, but mine's got a heat's got a lot more miles on. Anyway, he's sitting somewhere having breakfast, but he couldn't. He didn't have a pen, so he couldn't write down the number. So I told him I would call you and ask you to call him, please. Well, ma' am, I appreciate that and also relate to him. Basically, there's a tax savings with you trading in a vehicle. I'm sure you guys, you know, y' all probably bought a gazillion vehicles before, so I'm sure you know how this works. You know what we buy, we pay cash for cars, and we keep them for 200,000 miles. So we don't buy a lot of cars, but we buy a good deal. We pay cash for it. We keep it up. We change the oil every 3,000 miles religiously, and we just take care of our cars and keep them for a really long time. So, no, we don't I don't know, maybe there's tax savings trading it in. I don't know that. He probably doesn't know that either. So I gotta say, you guys are smart people. You are my type of people. I mean, you gotta keep. Until the wheels fall off and you put more wheels. So. Yeah, I like that. That's the way to do it right there. And you don't pay all the interest, so, yeah, y' all definitely have a good head on your shoulders. But let me do this. I'll explain to him the tax savings of the vehicle, because basically you don't pay taxes on the difference of. You only pay taxes on the difference of the vehicle. So say. I don't know. I'm just throwing out a random number. Say our vehicle cost $[MONEY_AMOUNT] and the vehicle you're trading in costs $[MONEY_AMOUNT], or we're going to use $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for it. You're only paying taxes on the other $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So you've already paid it once on the vehicle that you already own. So you're not going to double pay tax. So basically you'll be getting even more for it. So if you just sell outright to somebody else, you. You'd actually have to sell it for basically $[MONEY_AMOUNT] in order to, you know, get that same value as, you know, if you were to just trade it in for [MONEY_AMOUNT], because there's that tax credit for that, too. Yeah, excellent point. And I tell he. He likes his [ORGANIZATION] Grand Cherokee Limited, so you don't have to sell him on the car. He loves them. He's had four. Great. Awesome. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. Maybe we can make it work. All right. Yeah. Thank you so much. Bye.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, I was calling about the. I believe it's the [DATE_INTERVAL] challenger [MONEY_AMOUNT] scat pack sector y' all got. Okay, what's your first name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, I guess somebody online to help you out with that. All right, thank you. This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, hey, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. I was calling about this [DATE_INTERVAL] challenger FRT392. Yes, sir. What can I answer about it? Well, I was wondering what y' all could do on it. Cash. So you're talking about the [DATE_INTERVAL]. So basically, all of our vehicles we price to the market. So we ship cars all over the country. And with nine out of 10 people shopping the Internet just like you, I can't put [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] of markup in these vehic. Also, cash is pretty much the same thing to us versus getting it from the bank. It's just who we're getting the money from. Are you local to [LOCATION]? No, I'm not. Okay, where are you located? I'm in [LOCATION]. Gotcha. Yes, like I said, I may have a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I definitely don't have [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Where were you trying to be on price? Closer to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Yeah, like I said, I mean, KBV typical is 41,000 on it. So we've already got it priced to sell, and it is pretty new to our inventory. I mean, like I said, I may have a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], but I don't have [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Have you driven one before? I have not. Gotcha. And how did you plan on getting it down to you? I would buy one white ticket, fly out, drive it home. Okay, now, I know you said [MONEY_AMOUNT], which is. I don't mean to be rude or anything. It may be a little bit unreasonable. What would the number have to be to make a deal with you? If you're reasonable, I'm flexible. So, like I said, I have a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], but I definitely don't have [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Let's see. I don't know, maybe [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And no title fees. Well, the title fields. The title fees are. Are between you and the state. So what would the. The price of the vehicle have to be? I mean, just a vehicle. Like. Like I said, I mean, you're registered. You'd be registered in [LOCATION]. So that would be between you and [LOCATION]. I mean, I surely want to help you out. I just. We only have so much markup in these vehicles. I don't know if I Got it down the third. If I got it to [MONEY_AMOUNT], would. What's that? I don't know. I'm not the [OCCUPATION]. I'm just one of the [OCCUPATION] here. But if I got it to [MONEY_AMOUNT], would you. Would you fly up and. And drive it back? And I. Like I said, I don't know if I. I don't know if I can do that. But if you're. If you would. If [MONEY_AMOUNT] would be good for you, I can ask my [OCCUPATION] if he would do that. I don't know if he would. However, I. I mean, it's always worth a shot. I can. I can always ask. Yeah, we probably see. Okay. What is your phone? [PHONE_NUMBER]. And what's your last name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Gotcha. And would you be trading in with us? No. Gotcha. But I've been. [DATE_INTERVAL]. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Same car. It's just a [DATE_INTERVAL]. And it's got the moonroof, but it only had 9,000 miles. They were wanting price on it was like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I told them that was a little bit out of my price range. And they were same thing. They're like, yeah, man, we really can't come down any. But this one. Oh, man. Honestly, I was really wanting to be [MONEY_AMOUNT], but this one ain't much above that. So I might could. [PERSON_NAME] could go up a little bit for this one, you know, and it's got the leather seats, which I like more. A lot of those [MONEY_AMOUNT], they got the cloth seat. Yeah. Well, as long as. As long as you would be good with [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I don't know. Like I said, I don't know if I can do it. However, I can ask and I can get you an answer here in a couple [DURATION]. If we were able to do that, when would you plan on flying up? It'd be. Let's see, I start my vacation [DATE] [DATE]. So it'd be sometime after the [DATE]. Okay, well, that's [DURATION] [DURATION] away from now. So we would probably have to do the paperwork and ship it out to you, and then you could fly up and come pick it up. Because we don't. We don't hold used cars. Right. So you got several options. You're saying like go ahead and pay for it and then come pick it up, you know, whenever I'm available? Yeah, correct. Okay. And that's. That's all. If I can get to that [MONEY_AMOUNT] number. As long as. As long as you're good. With the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I can. If they would do that just because I know we don't have [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] of markup in our vehicles, but it seems like the car you want. So maybe they're willing to help you out. But that's how the process would work, basically. As long as we come to an agreeance on numbers, then we will have. We will do all the paperwork. We'll overnight it to you, you sign everything and then ship it right back to us and the car is yours. And then it'll. Whenever you want to pick it up, you can pick it up. Okay. Yeah, I haven't went and talked to my bank yet. I kind of just been shopping around, so I'd have to do that. Obviously they're not open on Monday, so it'd be Tuesday before I get by the bank. Okay. Are you financing with them? Yeah, gotcha. Is there a specific rate they're giving you? I'm not too sure yet. Are you opposed. Are you opposed to financing with us? Yeah. No. It depends what type of interest rate y' all could get me. Okay. What interest rate are you looking for? I mean, rates have gone up, but we do compete with. We have 40 or 50 different lenders, so we do compete with a lot of credit unions. And of course I'd have to take a look at credit, but not any higher than 8%. And I make it get a co signer too. Okay. They bring in 10,000 down. And I really. I'll be honest with you. I don't have a lot of big purchases on my credit. I've got a credit card I've had for about [DURATION] [DURATION] and like a little personal loan from the bank I took out just to build credit, but my score is in the 700. Okay, well, how about this? I just sent you a text. If you can reply yes to it. And I'm going to send you over a link. If you could fill the link out, it's a credit application. From there, what I can do is take a look at your credit and see what rates we can get you. And then we can look at what payments we'd be looking at with [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down. And then we can kind of look over that and if it all works out, hopefully we can get you the car and we can go from there. Did you see the text that I just sent you? Yeah. It should say, hi, [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, I think. Hold on. Yeah, I just got your. Yes, let me make sure. I'm going to send you over the link and make sure you got it. All right, I'm sending it over right now. Did you get that? Yeah. Cool. Click on it and make sure that it takes you to a credit application. For me. Yeah. Cool, cool. Well, do you have time that you can fill it out? Oh, no, not right now. And to be honest with you, I want to look around a little more at some other cars before I run my credit. But, you know, if not, I'll go ahead and do it, you know, sometime in the next [DURATION] [DURATION]. But you guys probably won't be open again until Tuesday, will you? We're open tomorrow and Monday. Okay. What else are you looking at? Mainly just the Challenger 390. Gotcha. Now, what is it about this one that you wouldn't. That you don't like? Is there a reason why you want to keep looking? Mainly just the price. Okay. What would the price need to be for you to move forward? I'd like to be around [MONEY_AMOUNT] under, but I mean, like I said, it's not that much over that, so I'm not opposed to going up a little. But if it's something you like, if it's something you like, it's probably worth spending the extra [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] or whatnot to. To get what you want. But that's totally up to you. But I sure would love to sell you a car. And if I can help you in any way, I'd love to. So whenever you're ready, I'm here for you. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. If you want that number I texted you from is perfect to reach me at. You can text me. You can't call that number, but you can text it. And then if you fill out the credit app, just text me and say, hey, I filled it out and we can go from there. Do you know where you're trying to be per [DURATION] on payments? Around [MONEY_AMOUNT] or less. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well, I. Maybe. I mean, it just depends. It all depends. I don't know what I can do and can't do, but it sure is a beautiful vehicle. It came from one of our local guys that does business with us. He took great care of it. I mean, the thing's in great shape, as you can tell from the pictures. He always had it detailed and cleaned. One of my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] actually traded in for it that I work with a lot. But it's a clean vehicle and I'd love to. If you like it, I'd love to sell it to you. All right. Yeah, man, just. I'll just look around a little more, and if I want to move forward, I'll fill up that credit application and let you know something. Cool. Either way, I mean, if you can either finance with us or your bank, it may be easier to finance with us. We do compete with a ton of credit unions and get some of the best rates around, so surely we'd love to help you out. All right, man. Well, I appreciate it. Yes, sir. No worries. Let me know if. Let me know if you want to move forward with it. All right? We'll do. All right. Have a great night. You, too.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. If you know your party's extension, please dial that at any time during this message. Our business hours are Monday through Saturday, [TIME] to [TIME] to speak with our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], please press [PHONE_NUMBER]. To speak with our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], how may I object to your call? Yeah, I'm just. I think I'm looking for a [OCCUPATION]. Is there a specific [OCCUPATION] you want to talk to? No, just whoever is the coolest. Okay, I'll transfer you over there now. Okay, thanks. That was funny. Thanks. [PERSON_NAME] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Yeah, [PERSON_NAME], I can barely hear you, but I asked, I got transferred to you, so are you the coolest [OCCUPATION]? Oh, absolutely. No doubt. Good answer. Love the confidence. So I'm looking at two trucks that you guys have listed on [ORGANIZATION] and I'm just wondering if you can tell me if they're still available or if you still have them there on your lot. They've got everything that I want, so. Okay, I can definitely know. Do you have the stock numbers on them or. Yeah, let me look at this here real quick. Okay, I'll put you on speakerphone here. Okay, sounds good. You still hear me okay? Yes, I can hear you. Okay, so let's see. Can I give you a vin? Let me see. Yeah, what type of vehicles are they? Are there chevys, Fords or so [PHONE_NUMBER]. The [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] Silverado 1500 LTV Duramax. Okay, is this. I can't find the stock number on this. Is it a heavy duty or is it a. I don't think it's a heavy duty. Okay, so you're looking for the half ton fence. So. So is it brand new then? No, this got just under 13,000 miles on it. Okay, so let me. And you say it's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Let me look real quick. Iridescent pearl tricote. 10 speed automatic, 3.0 liter Duramax i6. Okay. [PERSON_NAME]. Thousand miles on it. Okay, let me see. It looks like it's currently available. Have you checked out the Carfax? On it. Were you able to look up the Carfax? No, I haven't. Okay. Just to let you know, it's what we call a manufacturer buyback. So it's like a branded title. Not salvaged, but it's branded. And are you familiar with that law, that. That [LOCATION] lemon law is manufactured buyback law? No. Okay, [LOCATION]. I mean, they're as you and I know. Well, hopefully you're not from [LOCATION], but I Mean they're very. No, you could say they're weird. That's okay. I mean they're very. If they don't get what they want, they cry about it, they whine, you know, and they want. You know what I mean? So basically they pass a law in [LOCATION]. Whereas if anybody buys a vehicle and within the [DURATION] [DURATION] 60,000 mile warranty period, if something goes wrong with it they don't like, they could have the manufacturer buy it back and then they can go buy a new vehicle. Now. Okay, the reason why this one was returned, why the customer made the manufacturer buy back is because the service engine soon light came on, which is usually means you need your oil changed. Right. And so some of these are the stupidest. Yes. I mean one, another one, another traverse that we had a little while ago was because the hitch cover on the back after they were at 56,000 miles in the hitch cover for some reason wouldn't connect all the way. And so they had the manufacturer buy it back because the hitch cover, one of the things wore out on it where it wouldn't connect. It's like, really? So that's [LOCATION] for you. So what happens is when [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] buys it back, they fix whatever the issue was and then they put a [DURATION] [DURATION], 12,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty on it, guaranteeing that they fixed the problem, you know, reassuring the customer that they fixed. And so they just added. And so this was because of that, that service engine soon light came on, which is a pretty dumb reason. I mean that just says, hey, you need to change your oil. So maybe this person didn't know how to do that, you know. So what you're saying is thanks to a silly [NATIONALITY], I'm going to get a good deal on a truck that's pretty much. Yeah, yeah, [LOCATION]. Yeah. So I mean, the title is what we call branded, but it's not rebuilt or salvaged. It just means the manufacturer bought it back. It's manufacturer buyback. And so, I mean, it's a chance to get a good deal because the manufacturer bought it back. Yeah, yeah. I mean, so I, I'm kind of [MEDICAL_CONDITION] and I've been watching trucks for like [DURATION] [DURATION] and having this LTV at this price with the features that it has is like a, is a really good deal on this truck. It is a crazy deal. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And then the other one, can I give you the other one that I'm looking at too? I'd love to know. It's, it's a GMC that's basically got the same features and everything. So it's a GMC. And this one, the [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], 1500, got 7200 miles on it. Okay, [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] GST. Hold on, Sierra. 1500. Okay to [DATE_INTERVAL]. It's actually the same. I mean, it's the. It's a 1500 SLT. Okay. Okay. Is it the white one or the silver one? Yeah, the silver one. Okay. Okay. Okay. This one. Okay. Yeah, for the 58,000, 7,200 miles. Okay. This one came from [LOCATION] also. It's another manufacturer buyback and this was vehicle reacquired by the manufacturer because of the. The battery failure. So obviously they needed a new battery and so they had the manufacturer buy it back because they needed a new battery. I mean, is that pretty crazy or what? So this buy back. So, I mean, this is. This is blowing my mind. I didn't know anything about this, but it's like never been in an accident. No. Something was wrong with it. Yeah, no accidents or damage reported. Yeah. It's just something because I mean, these cars are machines and when they come out of the factory, I mean, not all of them are perfect, something may go wrong, like, oh, maybe the battery will die or maybe the power steering goes out or I mean, they're machines, so they break down. That's why there's a warranty on it. But [LOCATION] aren't satisfied with the warranty. They just want. I mean, if they complain like I guess the laws, if they complain three times like, oh, this went wrong. Oh, this went wrong, then the manufacturer has to buy it back, you know, And [LOCATION], they do it just to get a. Get a newer vehicle, you know, or something like that. So, yeah, it's a crazy law. It's just ridiculous. I mean, but it gives our customers really good deal, you know. So do you have. And you have both of those right now still? Both of those trucks? Yeah, it looks like both of them are currently available and that they haven't been sold yet. But I can definitely double check for you when I get off the phone here and I can, you know, send you a text message and just kind of let you know, hey, it is available, you know. Yeah. So here's the only other little weird deal that I've got going on. So I'm in [LOCATION], so I mean, I'm probably [DURATION] [DURATION] away or so. Yeah. And then I'm also, I've got a. I drive a [DATE_INTERVAL] Tacoma that I'm going to try to sell private party. I've got it scheduled to be detailed on Wednesday and then. Yeah, I'm not sure how long that's going to take to sell, but I don't know if I could put a deposit down on one of those trucks. If I came up maybe tonight and looked at them. If I could put a deposit and then. Anyways, I don't know how I would work that out. Yeah, well, you came up and. Yeah. And you're just maybe. Maybe another question, right. Yeah, yeah, correct. Because we've got. I don't know if you. [ORGANIZATION] to. [ORGANIZATION] can do anything, but we've got that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] down here. I don't know if. If I did come and put money down on it and sign off on it. If you guys could transfer that vehicle down here to [LOCATION] or I guess if I would just have to drive up again. I'm not sure what we can do on that. Yeah, a lot of the paperwork, you know, I mean, it has to be done like on site because there's a lot of electronic paperwork. A lot of it's electronic. Have the customer sign. So I mean, if you come up tonight and you like. If you like one of them, you're like, yeah, this is it. I mean, we could. Yeah, put the deposit on it and just hold it for you because I mean, you should be able to sell it to Tacoma pretty quick, you know? Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah. So, I mean, and then we could hold it for you until you sold it or. How much do you think you can get out of the Tacoma? So just a couple other local [OCCUPATION] down here. Like I went to the [ORGANIZATION] and [NATIONALITY] fork. They were going to give me [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it. And I went to another dealership and they were going to give me [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it. But I think I'll be able to get between somewhere between [MONEY_AMOUNT] and [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it if I do. Private party. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, anyways, that's kind of where that's at. Okay, well, yeah, I mean, just come up and if you like one of these, we can put a deposit on it. It pretty sure it's when you want put your pause on it and then you just put. Lift it for sale, you know, on Wednesday, just throw it up and then it'll be. Get detailed Wednesday and then you can start showing it Thursday then Just, just, yeah, take, you know, hopefully sell it soon and then should be good to go. I mean, if you can't do it. Yeah, I'm hoping to have it sold within [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah, yeah, you should be able to. And we can Definitely hold it for [DURATION] [DURATION] for you. That will be no problem, you know. Okay. Okay, well, let me. I'm going to pick up my kids from a birthday party party right now. So let me get my kids home, then talk with my [MARITAL_STATUS] and if I can head up there, I'll. I'll head up there right now. Okay. Okay. What was your first name? It's. It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And your last name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, awesome. Awesome.

Sure, we can do. And you, and you. You close at [TIME], right? Did I hear that right? Yeah, we closed the date. And so, I mean, you can. You can come at [TIME] and test drive it. You like it? Look it over and throw a deposit on it and then we can just finish it up when you sell. When you sell. Yeah, I mean, that's the nice thing is that I know that. I know that I kind of know what I want. Those. Both of those trucks have what I want, so. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So you can just test driving to make sure they both drive good, which was 7,000 miles and the low miles. Yeah, they still drive pretty good. Because they're right, you know. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. Okay. Super. Okay, well, yeah, shoot me a text and I'll. I'll be in touch. Okay, I will.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Yes, looking for a [DATE_INTERVAL] GR86. Do you have one in stock? GR86. Give me just one second, sir. Let me check, see what my inventory looks. So it looks like I've only got one. It's an incoming unit. It's going to be here right around the [DATE] ballpark. They're going to be here the last [DURATION] of them. The last [DURATION] of the [DURATION]. What color? What color is that? This one is Halo. So it's going to be an off white and it has the black suede and leather trim bolsters. Oh, yes. Wrong color. I saw the one you have coming in the near future. That's the only one we have coming for [PERSON_NAME]. We may get another one allocated for next [DURATION], but because we never know what's going to be incoming. Okay, how long it takes. So if you come in and place a deposit, it takes anywhere between [DURATION] [DURATION], up to [DURATION] [DURATION] for us to be able to get the car you want. Really? Most places saying [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION], no longer. So y' all can get them that quick? Well, we usually preference our vehicles. So if you are looking for a regular model, most of the time it's, you know, we're able to get them, you know, within [DURATION] [DURATION]. Figure we are not allowed to legally keep your deposit longer than [DURATION] [DURATION]. So if it's going to take longer than [DURATION] [DURATION], they're lying to you. So what you're saying when they order one, they say it taking up to [DURATION] [DURATION]? What are you saying about that? It just. Well, like I said, anything after [DURATION] [DURATION], at least at our dealership, we don't do deposits for longer than [DURATION] [DURATION]. Before we used to, but you know, there were instances where, I mean, people were waiting, you know, wanting very limited models and sometimes they would take like [DURATION] [DURATION], I think up to [DURATION] [DURATION]. And we're just. Our company is just not doing that anymore because we usually hold deposits only for a [DURATION] [DURATION] span. Okay. But I know it's not on you, but just like the manufacturer and when you put in order, he just think they still probably wouldn't ship it back that quick. Manufacturer ain't going to get it to you that quick. Right? Yeah. So if you were wanting something regular trim. If you wanted like a regular trim. Yeah, we could preference it because we usually get two, maybe three allocation lists a [DURATION]. So we can try to preference every allocation. So we can try to get it to you the fastest possible. But obviously Some of the more limited trims are going to take a little bit longer, qualify special. I mean, the color, you can get the color you want though, can't you? Depending, like I said, depending on the trim and the color. If it's one of the harder to find ones, it may take a little bit longer. But your basic colors, Black, white. Yeah, red. Because they shouldn't be too hard to get. Y' all not selling them over sticker price, are you? I think ours is [MONEY_AMOUNT] over, including the dealership accessories and the market adjustment. When you say [MONEY_AMOUNT], what do you mean [MONEY_AMOUNT] what? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] over? Yes, sir. Wow. Man, that car's gonna run a whole lot in the sticker price. Basically black, [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And y' all adding [MONEY_AMOUNT] more [MONEY_AMOUNT] for that? Well, like I said, depending on the trim. Yes, I got one just like cloth and pure, you know. Yeah, I think the, the basic models are. I think those are [MONEY_AMOUNT] over. [MONEY_AMOUNT] over. It's just for the dealership accessories. What is y' all required to add a lot to that on dealership accessories? What are y' all. What, what's the dealership accessories y' all be adding to that tint? Nitrogen LoJack, which is a GPS system, protection packages. Like I said, those are just your standard accessories that they add to every vehicle. So standard, right? Yes, sir. So basically what I'm looking at the price of one, you know, just like. Yeah, so for like, like if you like, for a premium. So premium, you're probably going to be right around [MONEY_AMOUNT], maybe [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus TTNL. Yeah, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's a whole lot over. Like I say, the sticker price is just like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What I'm looking on. [MONEY_AMOUNT] MSRP. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] for these, sir? Yeah, it does not probably what you're looking as a base model. It does not include the factory installed accessories. So roughly like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What you're saying? No. Yeah, [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus tax, title, license. It was back in the [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yes, sir. For a base model? No, sir, for the premium. Okay, what's the other price? Not the premium. Then what's the other price? So for the more basic, I think those are probably going to be right around [MONEY_AMOUNT], if I remember correctly. What y' all adding to that under [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Same, same packet, same of the same accessories. [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus or what? Plus etno. Oh, you're not adding anything. That's just textile analysis on the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. 1 to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right. Okay, let me give you my name and number. Just happen you have more. It's hard to get one in red, though. You probably. You're probably not looking at. They're probably going to ship you one. Or do they ship you if you want one, I can. I can have one preference for you. Like say they just may take [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] for us to get it for you. Okay. All right. So it's a name said. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. Okay. And what's a good phone number for you, [PERSON_NAME]? [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER]. That should have popped in here in your information. Yes, sir. And then you said you were looking for a base model GR86. Yeah, because other one you talking about just gonna run too much. It's gonna be up there in the [DATE_INTERVAL], you know. And the color you were looking for was the red. Yeah, with a black and. Yeah, gotcha. All right, [PERSON_NAME], give me just [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. I'm going to go talk.

"Good afternoon, this is [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How can I assist? I was calling, I bought one of my trucks in there before you guys serviced my stuff. Basically I was calling trying to see if you guys had any leasing deals going on and if you guys had any 2500 diesels. I have a [DATE_INTERVAL], 2500 gas, and I'm trying to trade that in and not put anything down and have the same payments. Sure, no problem. Let me see if I can pull up something for you. I see your information here. Is your name. Yeah, correct. Awesome. Awesome. And you purchased a Bighorn. Correct. The one is this one, a big one. I believe this is a [OCCUPATION]. Actually. The [MONEY_AMOUNT], I think is the one I was looking at, but it should be the 2500 [OCCUPATION]. 6.4 liter. Gotcha. The [MONEY_AMOUNT], I think that was the white one. Oh, that's correct. Yeah, yeah, that's correct. [DATE_INTERVAL], I believe. I guess you. You might have been here after that. I guess it didn't work out. But I see here is [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] 2500. I do have several different options here in [DATE_INTERVAL]. That's diesel. So did you want to stop in so we can appraise your vehicle and we'll take a look at what we have here? I mean, you guys have. You guys have appraised it like 10. You guys just appraised it like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago probably. I was in the middle of doing some stuff with my credit, but now I'm available now too. I think last time you guys couldn't come up with a deal. But first of all, before I want to see if the deals be able to be possible, if the deals can be made out comes to base, you know what I mean? I want to know, you know, I can give you guys the numbers. You guys already have basically everything. You guys service the vehicle. You guys have appraised it not that long ago. Nothing really has changed on it. And. But yeah, the only thing that's probably changed from the last time I was there is that my credit score is actually higher than I thought it was. But that's okay. Change. So. But yeah, that's what I want to do. You know, kind of go with, depending on what you got, which credit score you guys go with? [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. And my highest is [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. I mean, it's always. It's always a lot easier to do everything here at the dealership. Obviously, you know, we haven't selected the truck yet. We haven't seen anything here. I'm not sure what equipment you need, what trim level you need. So it's always best to at least come in. It'll take us [DURATION] [DURATION] to appraise your vehicle, give you the best offer for it. It's end of the month, so you're definitely going to get a great deal. [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] as well. So there's a lot of things that are for your advantage. Yeah, but I already know kind of what they cost. I'm not looking for anything crazier than like a bighorn 22. The trim package isn't really that important to me. I just look over something either white or granite or black. I mean, I know they're about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So I want to know if, with my trade, if, you know, if it's going to be able to be the same payments786, and not have to put anything down. I know that you guys can work the numbers before I even go there. I mean, this [DRUG] is negotiated by trade and everything. Okay. I do have to. I have a black one and a granite one, very similar in pricing. A certain one that you prefer. The black one. Preferred black one. Okay. I'll send over that information to you through text so you see it. Make sure he has all the equipment you need, and then I'll try to, you know, do a blind appraisal. You send me your. Your current miles and everything, and hopefully we can figure this out for you. Okay, cool. Yeah, cool. Yeah, like I said, you should. It should. I guess I was just there recently, so, like, you guys just did, you know, the servicing and all that stuff. So I think all the mileage should be pretty close to that. But what happened last time you were here that we couldn't get a deal. Gone. The payment was too high. Was it similar. The payment was like. The payment was like [MONEY_AMOUNT] and. Okay. What are you currently paying? That's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Are you leasing it or just financing? No, leasing. You're leasing. Yeah. And that's what I wanted to do. And you're with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I can imagine. I'm with [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] right now. Oh, you're a bank. Okay. Yeah, I did [ORGANIZATION] when I got my first one. This is. This would be my third gram that I buy. Not from you guys would be the second one I buy from you guys. If we. If we did it. Okay. And by any chance, have you tried calling for the payoff through [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]? You guys. You guys, did. You guys. You guys don't keep that on record. I can see. Yeah, I'll look into that. I'll see if I can find it. I remember. It was like. I remember, honestly, each time that we call, I had you guys do it twice. The not from serve this servicing, but the one before that. And dude, I swear, each time that you guys call us, bank gives a fucking different number. One time they were like 38. And this last time they were like 40. And I was like, how the hell does this happen? You know, like every time a college comes in different. So I don't know how the. Yeah, yeah, I'll see if I can pull it in my end. If not, then we'll. We'll call it in. That's not a problem. Cool, Sounds good. And then like I said, you wrote down the credit score, so now you know. Yeah, I think last time we were. We're punching numbers with lower. But I know it doesn't matter unless you're like over [MONEY_AMOUNT] something. So. And you say you're currently at what, [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]? So my. It depends on which ones do you guys use? We check all three. But what's. What's the highest? My lowest. My lowest [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And my highest. My Experian is the. Is [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then TransUnion [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And the other one is. Okay, I'll look into it. I'll check it out. I'll see if I can, you know, get this payoff. Just like I said, I'm gonna text you now through my personal cell phone. Just send me the current miles, and I'll. I'll get the blind appraisal star for you. Okay, awesome. Cool, man. All right, thanks. Thanks a lot.

"Good morning. Thank you for choosing [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Who do you have a pleasure speaking with? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How are you? I'm doing well, [PERSON_NAME], how are you today? Good, thanks. I got a car from you guys. Let's see when it was [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], [DATE] [DATE], and I just crashed it yesterday, unfortunately. Sorry to hear that. [PERSON_NAME], are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. The car I think is totaled, but I'll find out in the next day or so. Okay. So I don't. The person on my credit app here, it says. It's says it's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], but I thought it was a woman that helped me. I don't remember. I can check if anything. So [PERSON_NAME] actually does work here, but he's Internet sales, so it was definitely not him. I definitely was dealing with a lady. Okay, doesn't matter. But it was a loaner, like a. Like a loaner truck that we leased from you guys. I guess you guys are taking off the line. You know, you. Anyway, so I'm looking for the same thing. Looking for. All right, let me try and pull up your account first. Can I have a telephone number to do that, sir? Okay, so. Yes. You worked, I believe, with [ORGANIZATION] or actually, I don't. A bunch of different names here. I'm not exactly sure either. Oh, well, you have an X3. Yeah. Okay. I have no relationship really with her beyond that one transaction, so I don't care. So right now I actually don't have any X3s. We only have for the SUV's right now. The X5 and X7 left for demos than if you were open sedans. I have pretty much every model here. I mean, I love my X3. It was awesome. You know, you can see what I do. You know what the buyback on my car is, you know, so let's say the car is totaled. How does that work? Well, they will provide you with a check for the value of the vehicle. Your car was sicker was about [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, but that's not what they're going to pay me for. Right? They're going to pay me for the amount. No, the amount. I would assume that they're going to pay you for the amount used or remaining on it to cover it, whatever the payments are. Right? Yeah. Plus maybe a little bit on top. I just don't know how they calculate that though. But I think you should be getting maybe a little bit more on top, maybe give or take or at least around the area where you need to be to pay it off. Right. And then there's a payout amount. Right. For the disposition amount. Yeah. So if you were to buy out the lease, let's say that this didn't happen, your residual value is about like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that's what they're going to end up sending you guys. Right. Because they're going to. I believe so. Not really 100% sure how the insurance works, but I do know that they do cover the amount or at least pay what it's worth. Not the full amount, though. Right. And what about my deposit that I put down? That's gone. Right. That's history. Yeah, that's pretty much. Even if the only downside of leasing. Yeah. Because that expires. That only covers a period of time. The gap insurance or. Well, it does. The gap insurance does pay. Cover you. Let's just say, you know, you got the car just now and it gets totaled, you don't really have to worry about it. But it has nothing to do with the down payment. Yeah, the down payment's pretty much why people put minimum down for leasing. That's the only reason why. For this purpose alone. Yeah, for that. Because, you know, let's just say you decide you want to buy it up, pay the lease out of one time payment when you first get it, and then you get totaled the next week, that's all gone. So you have a loan, you have a 5 Series loaner? I do have 5 Series loaner and new cars. But in regards to like x3s, I'm just empty right now. Not even new cars I have. Right. So on the five series, are we able to get something in this range Price. Range of what I paid? What you're paying right now is a really good payment. I don't think I can get anything in that payment right now. Honestly, even with that amount down [MONEY_AMOUNT], right. What you're currently paying. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was a good time right now. I mean, everything has increased a lot in regards to payments. Sure. So I don't exactly think I can get you that close to it. If anything, you're close or bad to get to that payment. At least close to that payment would be like a three series. Right. But it's still going to be higher than that. Okay. All right, I'll circle back with you guys. Thank you. All right. No problem, sir. Take care, though. Have a good day.

First of all, I do not pay this [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh, so even though we already took off 5, do you want the other 5 off too? Is that what you're saying? What do you mean? It was [MONEY_AMOUNT], so we already took off [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Are you asking for us to take off the other [MONEY_AMOUNT]? Yeah. Oh, that's tough. We already did take. Discounted by half now.

Like, if you can come in today and talk everything about it, or you can come in on Monday. When can you make it in, but, you know, so right now I'm in [LOCATION]. I'm not in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. So I would like to talk more details with phone. Yeah, if everything is okay, I can be there to pick it up. Yeah. But if everything not okay, I will not drive so long to be there. Yeah, yeah, no, I got it. Never mind. So you wanted to go over numbers. Did you want me to show you, like, financing or leasing? So right now I'm not. Not interested about the financing or leasing. I'm still focused on the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The market adjustment. Yeah. Yeah, if that one I still need to pay, maybe I have to give up. Yeah. Okay. So if I was able to take some of the [MONEY_AMOUNT] market adjustment off, you'd be interested in getting it? Yeah, yeah. If you can take that off, I may be interested to be there to pick it up? Yes. Okay. Well, what I'll do then real quick is I'll talk to my [OCCUPATION], see if that's something that's possible. Yeah, I can pay. I can pay one time. Yeah, you can pay one time, you said? Yeah. Like with a check? Is that what you mean? I think maybe check. Yeah. So let me. Let me go ahead and get that information for you and I'll give you a call back. Okay. You have my phone number.

So that purchase order that they got, as long as they reviewed it and they're good with it and we have an approval, just a letter saying that they've reviewed it and approve it, and that's it. My [OCCUPATION] said once he gets that, we're good for you to come in and sign everything. Okay. All right. All right. Wonderful. Just give me a call if you need any other questions.

And the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] matrix [DATE_INTERVAL]. [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] matrix Base. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hello? Yes sir, he did not answer. Okay, let me transfer you over the other gentleman. Let me look at it. Sorry, it's just we have two different lots so let me look at it real quick and see what [EMAIL_ADDRESS] can tell you about it. Okay, thank you. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] just don't. No problem, no problem. Let's see. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Let me clock on the stock numbers, see where it is at the process. Bear with me. It's in service so RMH service. So it looks [EMAIL_ADDRESS] it's going through service rate as we speak. It just got here so it's just going through the oil Change service detail aspect. So it looks [EMAIL_ADDRESS] it is still available. Yes. Okay. It's a 1:1 owner, 93,875 miles. Regular oil changes on it. So you typically the people that own these cargo vans, they take really good care of them because they drive them a lot, you know. So it's been really well taken care of as far as the oil changes. If you can click on the car facture, you know, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] can send you the link your email, but. And then my question is Saturday, what time you got at the open? Saturday from [TIME]. Yeah. [TIME] till [TIME] [TIME] to [TIME], right. Okay. Yeah. Maybe by driving from [TIME]. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got it [DURATION] [DURATION] around and then from start to finish the process. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] mean, Saturdays are really, really busy days around here. So [EMAIL_ADDRESS] mean, [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. It's just so [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't want to set false expectations. You know, we might be able to get you in and out of. In and out of here quick enough depending on how much information and what we get from you. But you know, sometimes it can take a little bit. So it's better timing the faster. Right. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] around [TIME] is the better for timing, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] would say especially if you have [EMAIL_ADDRESS] all your insurance information to me and all that stuff and [EMAIL_ADDRESS] get your driver's license. Are you going to pay cash for this or finance? [EMAIL_ADDRESS] want to have do the financial, you know, and [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got it. See, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] would want to send you. Okay. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] would rather, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] want to do [EMAIL_ADDRESS] this. My credit is not good, but [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got the guys who can go with me for the, for the loan and he got the perfect credit. And. And so he would have to come. He would, he would make you the trip with you. Yes. Okay, cool. Yes. Okay. So then my [MARITAL_STATUS] got the better credit [EMAIL_ADDRESS] need. Maybe [EMAIL_ADDRESS] pay for my [MARITAL_STATUS]. Okay. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] want to prepare the down payment too. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't know how much [EMAIL_ADDRESS] needed, but maybe my cousin is coming with me for the loan maybe to pay too much. And then my question is maybe, maybe it's possible because somebody say me [EMAIL_ADDRESS] this, where they're from, from this place. From the right. This is the city. What. Where you got it? Yep. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION], correct? Yes, yes. Yes. It's possible to, to move this car to the different dealership role or no. Yeah, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] mean you can, you can have it shipped. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] mean, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] cannot have it shipped to another dealership now. Unless that dealership would buy it from. From here. Okay. Okay. Because [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got it. Or a different option, one more option too about if [EMAIL_ADDRESS] be. If [EMAIL_ADDRESS] have this car on the [LOCATION], [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got the option [EMAIL_ADDRESS] this that [EMAIL_ADDRESS] can come in with my friend and he can pay the cash the car, you know, with me together and, and you know, but probably he needs to be on this place for do the all financial right. If we pay that total price for cash. But if you buy, if you buy it in cash, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] just need you. If he's gonna, if you're gonna finance it and he's gonna be a co signer, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] would need both of you. That is correct. Okay. Okay, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] understand. If [EMAIL_ADDRESS] pay the cash, he don't need to be there on the knee. Right. And right. Yeah. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] mean, correct. You know, if you bought me [EMAIL_ADDRESS] being that you're out of state, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] cash. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] mean [EMAIL_ADDRESS] either cash cash or you know, a bank certified check or a [OCCUPATION] check or something [EMAIL_ADDRESS] that. And the question is if somebody got it, if [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got the bad credit. But if [EMAIL_ADDRESS] take my cousin, he got the perfect credit [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] around [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] points. My question is if he coming with me to the loan. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] know that it's not perfect. You say me, but how much around [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got at the percentage. [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. That's up to the bank. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't determine the aprs. We don't determine the percentage rates here. That's up to the bank. All they know is we got over 30 different lenders. Close the 10, close 5. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't, [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Sir, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't really don't know. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't. Yeah, I'm not a bank. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] just sell cars. Yeah, that's up to the bank. Yeah, it just depends on what, it just depends on how much it's. And it's all depends on debt to income ratio. You know, how much he's got out, how much he's got coming in and things [EMAIL_ADDRESS] that. The banks look at everything. They look out how many open credit cards he has, how many open loans. Does he have a house, does he have a cottage, does he have a boat, a motorcycle? Does he, you know, does he own it? And then he looks at that and he looks at his income and then they kind of look and see, okay, can he afford this? You know, there's so many different factors for me to even try to guess a rate that wouldn't even begin to start. Okay. Now when we price, when we price our vehicles, we always price them at an 8% interest rate, which is our customer average. So [EMAIL_ADDRESS] could spit out a stor average for you and then it would go up or down from there, depending on how well you pan out. When we started, if we started talking about pricing. Yep. And one more question. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] before [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Because for sure, 100% [EMAIL_ADDRESS] be there on the Saturday, but it's the best option calling [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] first day or Friday before [EMAIL_ADDRESS] driving. Because you can sell in the car, right? No, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] would do. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] want to do it today. Let's get. If you're serious about it, I'll get your information, I'll send you over the credit app. You fill it out, we get it going, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] get you the VIN and we move. Because these don't last long on my lot. You know, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got a lot of people call for these and grab them. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] want to do it now. People calling and they want to do that. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] know, but the cousins will be with me. Right. Because. Well, you can still fill out the credit. Yeah, you could. You guys can get pre approved from remotely. I'll send you the credit app. You fill it out, he co signs for you, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] get you approved. And then [EMAIL_ADDRESS] say, okay, come in on Saturday with you and your cousin and you guys come here Saturday, you both sign and drive home. Okay. How you can send me for the email. Yeah, yeah. Your name is. Your name is [PERSON_NAME], right? Seven. Is that correct? Yes. Let me do this real quick. Okay, your first name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, Got the [PERSON_NAME]. This the [NATIONALITY] name, right?

[EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Or [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Yes. Okay, so, okay, that. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Okay, so can [EMAIL_ADDRESS] repeat that to you? It's [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [VEHICLE_ID] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [VEHICLE_ID], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS].

Not correct, but. Okay, I'm tired with this. My language is problem, probably. No, no. Here I'm doing this problem. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] first one after the [EMAIL_ADDRESS], the circle. Not. Not [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS], only [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. [EMAIL_ADDRESS], what is the different. [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. What is the [EMAIL_ADDRESS] different. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Hold on. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] just texted you for my personal cell phone. Just text it back to me, and then I'll send you the credit app. I'll call you right back when [EMAIL_ADDRESS] get it. Is that okay? It's all right, sir. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got it. One most. One second. Yeah, just text it back to me. Yeah, you should be heavy. Okay. [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Okay. You. Yes. No, no, no, no. You don't have to apologize. Okay, what is the [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]? [EMAIL_ADDRESS] what? [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] or [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS], you know, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Yep. It's all [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Yeah, because you say [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS], and [EMAIL_ADDRESS] think even [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] is starting from this letter, you know. Yeah. Or [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. How about that? [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Okay, now we gotcha. Thank you so much. No, thank you for. It's all right. All right, so I'm going to create a new one. Okay. Now bear with me, sir. Bear with me. How would you feel possible sending me the video of this car? [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] first video, but only come on and with the phone and. And do the video [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] inside and outside very fast. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] one. Or [EMAIL_ADDRESS] could take. Or [EMAIL_ADDRESS] could. Yeah, yeah, it's possible. If you can, I'll do it with my phone. Oh, perfect. Perfect. Are you be there Saturday, too? Oh, yeah, I'll be here Saturday. I'm going to help you out. Perfect. Okay, so [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got that done. You are the best. You are the best. No, no, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] just try to be as good as [EMAIL_ADDRESS] can be. Let's see here. Okay, so you know that number [EMAIL_ADDRESS] just texted you from my cell phone? Will you send me a copy of your driver's license? Yes. Front and back. Front and back. Shoot. Not the problem. And let me do this. There you are. Front and the back. What is your city and state? [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. But the village of [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [EMAIL_ADDRESS] that. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. What's your zip code? [LOCATION]. Yes. [LOCATION]. Okay. [PERSON_NAME] @ interior on the driver's item. They got it there. Oh, no, it's correct. [LOCATION]. Yes. Okay, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got it here. Okay, so [EMAIL_ADDRESS] just emailed you the credit app. You're sending me the email, right? [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't have. Yep. It'll say. It'll say get pre approved and then go fill it out to the best of your ability. And whatever you need help with, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] will call you when it notifies me when you're done and I'll call it up and dot the [EMAIL_ADDRESS] across T's. So do you see it? Do you see it in your emails? Yes. One second. Maybe they're different. No, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] see you don't have a. It might be in your spam, too. It'll say not yet. You know, it's not coming yet. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] better have your right email address. Let's see here. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] Yeah but sometimes take the long time. Yeah. You know, from somebody. Well, let me do this. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] already. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] emailed you. You're the credit app. Take a look on that email. Let me track down the keys and do a couple videos and then I'll call you when [EMAIL_ADDRESS] get back to my desk. Okay. If you need. If you need me though, the best way to get a hold of me is on my cell phone. That's what [EMAIL_ADDRESS] just texted you from. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] always have that on me. So you could always reach me there. Okay. Yes. And the one more question. Yes, sir. Yep. Because if [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got the. Around the [TIME] point only my [MARITAL_STATUS] got it around the [TIME] but she don't have the driver's license. You know, she never driving. She can take. She could be on the loan. She just. She can be on the loan. Yeah, she just. That's fine. She doesn't need a driver's license to be on the loan. Just the id. Right. Yeah, just an id. Yep. Just a state ID now she won't be able to on this time. Maybe. Maybe [EMAIL_ADDRESS] call to my [MARITAL_STATUS]. She sent me the Social Security number and she sent me there. She would just have [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. She would be coming with you, correct? If [EMAIL_ADDRESS] decide to do with my [MARITAL_STATUS] probably needs to be with me, you know? Yeah, yeah. You can pick whoever you want and then I'll. I'll just run it and if the banks say yes? They say yes. If we need something else, well, I'll let you know. Yeah. Because here on the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] find the one car but it's too much, too much expensive. Because this is the model [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [DATE_INTERVAL]. But [EMAIL_ADDRESS] only go there and [EMAIL_ADDRESS] want to look at this car, you know. And [EMAIL_ADDRESS] look at. Because this car [EMAIL_ADDRESS] need to. To work, you know. I'm the [OCCUPATION]. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got the [OCCUPATION] company, you know. And. And you know this is important that [EMAIL_ADDRESS] needed for. For. If [EMAIL_ADDRESS] If. If this size [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] it, you know because [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't want to transit very big van only [EMAIL_ADDRESS] need to something between trans between four transit connect and for transit perfect. And this is the middle perfect. And [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] it everything, you know the size everything is. It's fine, you know. And [EMAIL_ADDRESS] decided to do. To buy exactly this model and this car. But [EMAIL_ADDRESS] want to make sure and this guy give me the. Check it out my credit the Saturday and you know, for me he say you got the Bad credit. And the best option is find somebody. But she gave me some proposition, you know, and [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got proposition. And this is possible, you know, to buying this car. But for me it's too much pretend, you know, and [EMAIL_ADDRESS] try to different option. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] maybe my [MARITAL_STATUS], maybe my cousin can coming with me. And, and you know, and, and [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't know which option is the best for me. And the one last option is [EMAIL_ADDRESS] this, that my company. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] if [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] got a dead painting. Get your cousin who has that [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Get the guy that has the [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] that's gonna be our best. The guy that has the [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] credit score. Get him. The best is taken up here, right? Yeah. Yes. Get the guy with the best credit and then we'll, we'll run it through that way. Okay, but you know. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] know, but this is the third option. Because sometimes this is just my cousin, not my [MARITAL_STATUS], you know, and sometimes if [EMAIL_ADDRESS] need to pay a little more. But if [EMAIL_ADDRESS], if, if [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't need to take care of my cousin, you know, for, for this, because [EMAIL_ADDRESS] need to say to him, can you give me the favor? [EMAIL_ADDRESS] don't want to do [EMAIL_ADDRESS] this, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. More than usual, maybe. Yeah, throw your [MARITAL_STATUS] on there. We'll try her and we'll just let you know what she says. Yep, that'll work. If you prepare for me the video on this time [EMAIL_ADDRESS] call to my [MARITAL_STATUS] and maybe we can check my [MARITAL_STATUS] everything too, you know, how look, the situation with my [MARITAL_STATUS] and maybe it's all right going with my [MARITAL_STATUS]. If not, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] take my cousin for sure. Because today he said something [EMAIL_ADDRESS] this. Don't worry, [PERSON_NAME], if you don't have the. If you have the best situation, [EMAIL_ADDRESS] speak with my [MARITAL_STATUS] and maybe we can try help you with going with you to the loan, you know, and he explained me [EMAIL_ADDRESS] this. But we. Let me tell you this, [PERSON_NAME]. We're the best at what we do. [EMAIL_ADDRESS] am confident that we'll be able to get you approved. So this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna grab these keys, I'm gonna get you a couple videos. You work on finding that credit app and get your cosigner going. And then [EMAIL_ADDRESS] send you the video over. You fill it out and then we'll see you on Saturday. Exactly, sir. Okay, thank you. Thank you. I'll be in touch. Okay, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thanks. Bye bye. Thank you.",success,inventory_check,GLE350,medium,False,08079ccc4a7c429a9adbf1b83b7f19ec_transcript.json

Let me double check on that one for you. Give me one moment. Because I got to be honest with you. I thought, yeah, another dealership, a [ORGANIZATION] dealership, text me and said, and the number is similar to yours. And said, hey, sorry, that 1500 came in and it sold before I here. And I was like, oh. And I thought this was the [ORGANIZATION], but it actually was a whole different dealership and everything like that. And so I'm an idiot. And I would have not determined to make our appointment had I not been so freaking confused because I'm talking to so many different dealerships. You're totally fine. It's okay. So you. It was an RST that you were looking into, correct? Yeah. The stock number, I can give that to you real quick. It is if you want it. Yes. Yeah. The stock number is ct. Hang on just a second here. Hang on just one second. Oh, you're totally fine. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. That's right. Okay, let me. Give me one moment. Let me triple check, because the other one I have was the LTZ for you guys. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Correct. That's right. Okay. That's what I want to make sure. Let me see something. All right. If any. Transit. Yes. Yeah. So is it still available and just in transit still? I'm actually seeing it is shown still in transit. I'm checking the availability as we speak right now. Thank you. Absolutely. You're so welcome. Okay. Okay, so great news. It is still showing. Still available. So now what I'm going to do is, while I have you on the phone, I'm actually looking up, I can track how far it is and where it's at. Great. That'd be awesome. Yes. So it is available. So that's great news. I'm happy for there. And then now just, I'm just double checking that real quick. Sure. Okay. It is still in transit. Oh, wow. So it has a pending dispatch. Let me double check on something. So it is actually currently in [LOCATION]. Oh, so it's still. Yeah, so it's waiting for it to be picked up so it can have delivery. So it looks like it's just waiting to be picked up. So it's still here, it's still available, it's still in [LOCATION] and it's just waiting to get picked up so it can be delivered to us. Okay. How do I make sure without committing myself to buying it that it doesn't get sold before I get a chance to look at it? So the only thing I could recommend, and this is probably the only thing that would work, anytime someone would like a vehicle that's in transit, we require a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit. That's stating that you want it, you're highly interested and that gives. No, pretty much you're taking a claim on it until it gets here. Once it's, once it gets here, if you decide that you don't want it, it does forfeit that [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Or if you see another vehicle, I can talk to my [OCCUPATION], see about transferring that, that [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] to a different vehicle. But that's probably the only thing I would recommend that if you're, if you don't want no one to look at it, that's the only thing I could think of that would help it. But I want to make sure that you guys are aware of everything and that you're not getting sighted. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Okay. So it hasn't even been picked up from [LOCATION] yet. And then usually it's going to take probably what, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] at least. It does take a bit of a time. What I can do is I can keep an eye on it because it says pending dispatch. So most likely it's just getting waiting to get picked up for the. Probably within [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] if we're lucky. But it can take up to about [DURATION] [DURATION], plus if there's any crazy delays or train or something crazy happening. But as far as I'm looking at, it looks like it's just waiting to come in. Okay, well, I gotta tell you something. This is number one on my list right now and I've been looking at a lot of trucks. I was just, like I said, I was at [PERSON_NAME] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] or excuse me, [ORGANIZATION] little earlier this afternoon looking at a Sierra 1500 elevation. Because again, I thought this RST was sold out already, you know, and so. And it was really just some other [ORGANIZATION] I was looking at, so. Just dumb. Too many people I'm talking to. I'm sure you understand. Absolutely. You're fine. But yeah. So this one is like number one on my list of the trucks that I want. And I'm willing to wait a little bit and whatnot. In the meantime, I'll talk to the [MARITAL_STATUS] and see if she wants to put down a deposit on it, just to make sure. With the caveat knowing that we either one have to buy from you potentially to save that [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] and get it applied to a different vehicle, which is only a possibility, not a guarantee, or we lose that [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], which is guaranteed if we decide not to take the truck or what have you. Yes, sir, that's exactly. Okay, Sounds good. Don't forget about me, buddy. I appreciate it in your profile. Thanks for everything. And just let me know when you start hearing stuff. And if something changes on my end, like, you know what, I'm not going to wait around for this thing to get here. I found something that's fairly comparable or, you know, that SLT that I still kind of want to look at something like that. If something changes, I'll definitely let you know. But I gotta say right now, I mean, you know how hard it is to find a 1500 with the diesel, with the max tow package. It's pretty difficult. It's super difficult. So I may. Yeah. So I'll Talk to the Mrs. Tonight and then you and I will connect, whether that's phone call, text, or if I show up or whatever it is tomorrow, and we'll talk about, you know, deposit or whatever that looks like. Absolutely. And while you do that and I'll wait for your text, I'm actually going to see what we get because we actually have quite a bit of 1500 RSTs in stock. I'm going to see if anything I have on my lot has it that is a [ORGANIZATION] Diesel. And then if I do find one that's here already, I will let you know. Yeah, yeah. And it doesn't have to be a [ORGANIZATION]. I mean, if you have like something with a 6.2in it, like the big V8. I drove one of those just for giggles at the [ORGANIZATION] lot today. Man, that thing is fun. Holy smokes. It's got some grunt to it. Absolutely. If you had an RST with a 6.2, you know, I'd be interested in looking at that as well. So I know the 5.3. I know the 5.3 is a solid engine. It's a great engine. It's what I had in my [DATE_INTERVAL] Sierra [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. But I love the mileage idea of the diesel, but I love the horsepower idea of the six. You know what I mean? Absolutely. And I completely agree. So I'll do whatever I can to make sure that you try to save as much as I can for you and make sure no one looks at it. But yes, I would be more than happy to do that. Yeah. And then like I said, if you find another [ORGANIZATION] that maybe either has the diesel in there or the 6:2 and kind of fits what I'm looking for, let me know and I'll take a look at that and maybe we'll do a deal on a different truck, you know. Absolutely. And then are you. Is your heart set on the rst or is there a different trim level? No, I just. Yeah, it's just. No, I don't care about trim level necessarily. There's just [DURATION] [DURATION] of features that I need to have. And I kind of like the look of the RC because it's, you know, body colored bumpers and things like that. But I don't mind the slp or ltv, I should say, you know, or even. Even high country, for that matter. But ultimately what it comes down to is I want to stay as close to 65 as possible. And actually, if I could get even closer to 60, that would be even better. But if it's the perfect truck and everything I want and, you know, I fall in love with it, then, you know, we can talk. Absolutely. Well, then I will keep an eye on this. And then that 23 LTV is still available. So if that is something you still want to look at, I can pull that still, too. But I will keep an eye on that rst for you. And let me know what you and your [MARITAL_STATUS] decide, and then we can go from there. Okay. And if you hear of anything else on the lot rsts or what have you, let me know. You got it. I will keep an eye out for you. All right. Thank you. You're very welcome. You have a wonderful evening. I'll talk to you guys. Thank you. All right.",success,inventory_check,RST,medium,False,080b23666275424782809b6b423e9218_transcript.json

So if you're registering in [LOCATION], you would pay the [LOCATION] sales tax. You could either roll it into your deal or pay for it separately, whichever you prefer. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And if one were interested in some kind of warranty, do you offer any warranties? So a warranty does not come with a vehicle, but you do have the option of purchasing one.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I assist you today? Hi, do you guys have certified vehicles? Certified pre owned? Yes. No, we actually don't only pre owned vehicles. But I mean we do offer service contracts. Do any of them have warranties? I mean they have manufacturer warranty. And if you want to protect your vehicle, we do offer service contracts. So like for example, I'm going to give you a vehicle that I saw so you can let me know like what would be the coverage on that? All right. Okay. The stock number is [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. So is that [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Highliner XLE. No, no, no, [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] and boy [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], it's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] GLC300, correct? Yep. All right, so let me see if the vehicle is in stock and who I have the pleasure to speak to today. [PERSON_NAME]. Nice to meet you, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, so it still has manufacturer warranty left [DURATION] [DURATION] or 12,000 miles. [MONEY_AMOUNT], that's going to be on the basic and the drive train and the last. So after that, if you want to protect your investment after that manufacturer warranty expires, we do offer service contracts. So like that you can extend, if you want to extend the drivetrain or any other part of the vehicle that you would like. So what are those service contracts consist of? Like how much are they? How long are they for? Well, so like they're different. There are different packages and there's different prices. One, you're in [ORGANIZATION]. I mean you can know how much it is because they will explain it to you. Would you like more information about it? Yeah, I mean I just want a rough idea just to know if it's even an option. Like let's say it's like for like what, like maybe [DURATION] [DURATION]. What was, what would the prices start at for that? All right, so for that, let me just transfer you over to one of my [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] that they will know the answer and they can tell you more about it. Okay. All right, thank you. Thank you. Please hold it please. How are you? Good. They told me that you like this DLC I've got. And you had questions about warranty. Sorry, you faded out a little bit. Could you say that again? Once the factory warranty is up, what additional, what options do you guys have for additional cost? So warranty cost is going to be with the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. I don't have the actual pricing for it because it's custom. So like if you wanted an additional [DURATION] [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION], whatever it May be how many mileage like this. I'm sorry, you're breaking up. It's really hard to hear you. What are the price ranges for the warranties? Like, what's just an idea of the price ranges. I can find out for you and give you a ring back. I mean, Say that again. I said, isn't this the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? The guy I was speaking to said that someone in [ORGANIZATION] can help me with that. Yeah, this is [ORGANIZATION], so I'd have to have a [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] give you a ring back after they give you the pricing for the warranty. Is this something that you're planning on coming in for or. I mean, if the price is right. But I need to know. I need to make sure it makes sense for me. Yeah, let me see if I can get a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] to give you a call. Or give me the range. I can pay right back. You guys don't negotiate. You're breaking up. I'm sorry. Do you guys negotiate on your prices, or is it the set price? Our pricing here is set. My [OCCUPATION] fee is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's it. Tax tag, registration. Okay. Is there any negotiation off the [OCCUPATION] fee? Nope. Everything here is set. Okay, you can have them give me a call just so I could see what the price is for the additional warranty. Yep. Okay.

Yeah, of course. I would definitely want to take a look at a vehicle before I bought it too. Yeah. Yeah. So let me take a look for you and see what we have here in stock or available. Oh, wow. Okay. So this is pretty rare. Usually we don't have any Sequoias available at all, but right now I'm showing three. So we have a army green. They're not on the lot, by the way. I'm sorry, I'll just say that now. No, not yet. They're available to buy in the future. So I just want to say that we have a black, a white, and a gray. A silver, actually. And then the next one, the next one that will be here would be [TIME]. [TIME] through [TIME]. Okay, that's, that's soon. That's actually, that's like in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah. So. Yeah. When, when they come in, when it gets in, is there any way you can give me a call so you come look at one? Because, I mean, if we're gonna spend that much money on a, on a brand new car, I think we'll end up trying to customize it just there so we can kind of get. Yeah. Get everything going because I know we definitely want a white one and if anything, we probably end up going for the TRD Pro. Okay. But we just want to see how big the one is because we're, we're. We already started our family, so we're gonna just get a little bigger here in the next [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], so. So might as well get something that's going to be family size. Yeah, true. Yeah. The Sequoia is a great family vehicle. It has a lot of space in it. And the third row is really nice, too. Yeah. Have you got a chance to see one before? Like, have you noticed one. We have never seen one. Never been in one. I know my brother has a [DATE_INTERVAL]. I think it was like a [DATE_INTERVAL] Sequoia or something like that, like an older version. And he loves his. But we're like, well, you know, might as well just get a new one. The newest updated ones. And so that's why we want to see one inside and see how big it is and see how we. How we'd like it. Yeah, true. Exactly. They have a lot of new updates and a lot of cool features that, you know, you might not even know about. So I'm just putting some notes in my system here that your brother has one and you're pretty familiar with it, but haven't seen one at all. So. And here's the thing is, when it comes in, the one that's coming in is going to be pre sold. So we won't be able to drive it, but we'll definitely be able to take a look at it, if that's okay. Yeah, that's fine. We don't have to test drive it. I mean, we just want to see around it, see inside, see how spacious it is, and then kind of go from there. Okay. Then I'm going to make a note here. So that one comes in on [TIME]. [TIME]. So I'm going to schedule an appointment for. Let's see here. What [DURATION] are you available? Around Fridays. So that [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] we'd be available.

They didn't teach the kids how to speak their language. But you just make me. When I say, make me proud of you because you can speak real. I'm so proud of you because of that.

You mentioned insurance, but I don't get paperwork of insurance. I never agreed to insurance. And I sign it in the trust because that's what I used to do for [DURATION]. And I don't know how to do that because I know when you sign, you kind of, you know, locked in. But it's not right because I'm a very good customer of. Of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] for very, very long time. Of course. So I don't know how this can be fixed or. Or let me take a look at it and I'll see what I can do to get this. I just don't want to make it such a big deal, you know? No, you're fine. Like a crazy girl and stuff like that. No, no, you're fine. I'm very excited to meet you and to do the whole thing, but you.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] so I can help you. Yeah, I'm waiting for a call back from [PERSON_NAME] and I was seeing if he was available. Yes, this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, how are you? Good. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. You're going to call me back about your Silverado. Yes, I actually reached out, but you didn't answer. Here, let me see. Let me pull it up. Okay. Okay. Sorry. I'm getting ready to go on a camping trip. Oh, okay. No, no, you're good. So look, I brought it up and this is coming directly from my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. So the price. Sales price of the truck would be [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Your [ORGANIZATION] fees are [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Your taxes is going to be [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Your total out the door would be [MONEY_AMOUNT] with 50%. Okay, so [MONEY_AMOUNT] was your lowest. The [MONEY_AMOUNT] did not work? No, my lowest price. And this truck is discounted [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The lowest I'll be able to do on this truck is [MONEY_AMOUNT] without taxes and license. I'll have your taxes and license right here in front. Okay, can you send. Can you email me a worksheet of the payments for the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION]? The only way I'll be able to get that is if you submit a credit app. I can. And you can submit it. Okay. What I want to make sure is that the numbers line up with everything that I'm looking at before. So I submitted one last week and ready to pull the trigger. And then numbers changed and I was pretty frustrated. So there's no worksheet on. So we're talking out the door, [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus taxes and fees, right? Yes. So your total out the door would be [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's what you're going to finance, not including your $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down. So look, if I'm at [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] minus [MONEY_AMOUNT], you're going to finance [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And then I have good credit, so I'd qualify for like [MONEY_AMOUNT] at [MONEY_AMOUNT] or whatever you guys have, that's fine. So look it. I mean, it's just very hard because until I send it out to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], whatever bank they're going to use for. First of all, how many [DURATION] are you going to want to do? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What is that, [DURATION] [DURATION]? Yes. [DURATION] [DURATION] with [MONEY_AMOUNT] now, correct. [MONEY_AMOUNT] term. Yeah. So look, it's just. It's just. It's just a little hard because I don't know what rake they're going to offer you, so I'm going to have to submit it. I mean, you said you. You said you submitted one to this dealership [DURATION] [DURATION] before. You said last week. So they probably already have my application. Okay, awesome. And it was under. What's your last name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. My first name is [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, and when were you looking to fly in? Either. Either Monday or Tuesday. Whenever this goes through, like can play the. Get the down. I'm just the [TIME] or [MONEY_AMOUNT], so I do have. I do have an [OCCUPATION]. So I have a code from [ORGANIZATION] to give you. Okay. Are you a [OCCUPATION]? Yes, I work at a university. Okay, awesome. How were you gonna leave the [MONEY_AMOUNT] down? Cash. Check. Cash. Just like straight by green cash. Oh, I can pull it out. I can get something from my bank. I don't know. Like what kind of something? Like a [OCCUPATION] check. It'll be easier. Okay, that's what I'll do then. [OCCUPATION] check. Okay. And then what was the. For the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION]? What. What. What rate were they offering? Is that what. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yeah. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] APR and your percentage rate. Okay, so let me see if I still have your. Your do your. Your credit app on file. If not, I'll reach back out to you. And you said your schedule to fly in. I mean, here's the thing. I don't know if I can hold the truck only because it sits on such ad. I'll ask the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], but I'll. I will. [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] that you're looking. Applying on the. On [EVENT] [EVENT] or the [DATE]. Yeah. And. And I can put a deposit down. So before. So if they already have. If you already have my application, do you have to run my credit again? So I want to make sure this isn't like continuing. I don't think so. I think we'll just admit it if they had already ran it once. But I don't know. I mean, here's the thing. I can't take deposit over the phone. So what your deposit would be is me, you know, formulating the contract and just, you know, running the credit with the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down. And then I'll ask him if I can put the truck on the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] to wait for you either Monday or Tuesday here. Okay. I'm trying to find the whole. Just one second. I want to make sure that [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION]. Come on. [OCCUPATION]. I think it's an extra [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. There you go. Authorization number. Okay, do you have a pin? Correct. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Yeah, they sent me two of them. The second one because of a graduate. It's 1 0. Okay, so which one are you going to want to use? The [OCCUPATION] or which one? Well, I don't know. They're both $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So I have. I have a college grad and an [OCCUPATION], so I don't know if I can stack those or not. That's the question. Okay, so the [OCCUPATION]. If you just show me, like the school ID and something like that ID me, there should be no problem. Now, how long ago did you graduate for being a school graduate? [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Yeah, so for me to use that one, it has to be within [DURATION] [DURATION], so I won't be able to use the other one. But you do get the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] for being an [OCCUPATION]. So I'll read you the last four of. The [OCCUPATION] would be correct. Yes. Okay, cool. So I'll go ahead and use that as well. That's the code. I will need a screenshot of it when you get here, but let me just formulate it. Let me just put everything together for you and I'll show you how it looks. Okay. Also, is there any way you can screenshot me or something that APR for [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION], just so I can reference it to the [OCCUPATION]? It was over the phone when I talked to him, like. Well, actually, send me a screenshot. Hold on, let me see the screenshot. Okay. And then I'll give you my. This is my work. I'll give you my work phone because it's an iPhone, I can get pictures. This is my desktop phone. What's your phone? [PHONE_NUMBER]. Is that right? Correct. Okay. Okay. Hold on one second. Hello? Yeah, I'm looking at my phone for a picture. Hold on one second. Okay. Hey, I'm sending that offer because here's the thing. I don't know if I'll be able to combine special rate with a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] discount. I think it's either or. All right, so without running my credit, I need to figure out what that looks like because I don't want that. Keep running. Okay, so I need definites. What's your score right now? Close to [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. I'd say like [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] to [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Okay. Because rates right now are roughly between [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's roughly where you're going to be at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So [MONEY_AMOUNT], 8%. Okay. I'm looking for their [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's what I'm looking for. Yes. So if you want to. If you want to run the numbers for whatever I get for the [MONEY_AMOUNT], feel free to run them and give me a call back. Okay. So if you want the [MONEY_AMOUNT], it would be. The truck would be at. It wouldn't be discounted. It would be msrp. That's not what I've heard from anyone else. I don't know what you want. Can you check that? Because I'm calling a couple other people. I'll check the disclosure and I'll send it over to you. But I know typically it's either or. So I mean, I can't. [ORGANIZATION] doesn't. And this is from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. So, like, I can't combine the two offers. Yeah. Okay. So other places are. They're just saying the extra bonus cash that you can. That's what they're telling me. So if you could find out, I appreciate it. There's no problem. You're getting the truck $[MONEY_AMOUNT] off plus your. Plus you're educated. That's an extra [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But I can't combine the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. At a [MONEY_AMOUNT] term, it'll have to be either or. So you can get [MONEY_AMOUNT] and at [MONEY_AMOUNT] and buy the truck MSRP, which you would. Looking at, I believe [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What I'm saying is nobody else has told me that I can't get the [MONEY_AMOUNT] with any discount. So I need to know which discounts are available. That's what my [OCCUPATION] is letting me know. Because look it, I'm reading up on it right now. Let me see. Okay. Okay. Because I'm. Can you read it up on it and then text me or email me yes or no or what the deal is and then we go from there? Yeah, I mean, well, I mean, what are you going to want to do? Are you going to want to do special rate or do you want to get. I want. I want the numbers to know what the number difference in numbers are. So I have to. I can't just off the top of my head tell you what I'm going to do because I don't have. I don't know what the bottom line is for both of you. Know what I mean? Okay, that's fine. But we're. You want me to go ahead and use [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] for both. Right? [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] for both. Yes. Okay, well, it'll be technically [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] and [MONEY_AMOUNT], plus your educated rebate. Okay. Okay, awesome. So I'll get with you. Okay. Let me. Let me give it to my [OCCUPATION]. Thank you.",failure,price_quote,Silverado,medium,False,0916dbd79fa2498ea921dbd5c194cb8f_transcript.json

If y' all don't like that color the gun exterior. We do have an option as far as pre ordering. Basically what that is, is whatever. We'll go ahead and work the deal as if the vehicle was here on the lot. We'll get you guys in finance signed up and everything. And then as soon as the vehicle touches the ground, we do a PDI or. Yeah, pdi. A pre delivery inspection. Make sure that everything's perfect with the vehicle. We'll detail it, put some gas in it and then you guys are able to pick it up and then that's it. Okay.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], home of the [LOCATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I get your call. Hi, I was wondering if I could speak to. I think his name is [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, one moment. Let me try his extension for you. One moment. Thank you. We know how to help you make a decision without the hype and pressure most people. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME] and I am calling because I got your name from a friend of mine. Her name's [PERSON_NAME]. She came in last week and bought a pilot. Yeah, she's a doll. She is. She likes you a lot. So she gave me your contact. Contact information because she's actually the reason why she got a car is because I had her looking for me for, for a car and then she went and bought herself a car. So. Nice. Yeah. So I just wanted to see, I wanted. Before I like showed up and looked around, I wanted to see if you would be able to help me contact or kind of find what I'm actually looking for. Sure, sure. What are you looking for? Sure. So I am. Good question. So I'm interested in the crv, the one that's I guess the EX L. I guess with the. But I went, I want the leather seats and I'm not finding very many with the leather seat option online. And all wheel drive. Oh no, that's fine. So the. Just to give you a heads up how [ORGANIZATION] infinite thinking works, the L actually fans the leather. So if it's exl, it should have the leather. Oh, the thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, that's. A lot of people don't know that. No, a lot of people don't know that. So now that's all wheel drive. Yeah, no, you want. Those are. So the only thing I have available right now is an all wheel drive EXL without the blind spot. That's another issue that we're having here. Either comes with the blind spot or without. The only other thing I have is two wheel drive EXLs. That, that, that's it for right now. But let me, let me, let me see what's coming in because we do have a bunch that are ready to come in now. Do you recommend all wheel drive versus the other kind? Again, I get it. It's more of a preference. So I come from [LOCATION] [LOCATION] where I would say, you know, all wheel drive is like absolutely. Like you gotta have it. Yeah. Because it's not the snow, it's the water that turns to ice. You know, you need that extra grip. [LOCATION], you know, Listen, I've been in Torrential rainstorms and I drive a Civic down here and I haven't had a problem. But again, if it's a preference, I totally respect and understand that. I don't tell people what to buy. I just don't. You know, unless global warming gets really bad and we get like our first snowstorm down here, you'd probably be okay. Never know. Yeah, I think I like the option of all wheel drive just because of traveling also to different states. Yeah, see, there you go again. That makes sense to me. Okay, so I apologize. Let me see here. How soon do you need this vehicle? Oh, I don't need it right away. I'm just kind of looking around. So I'm willing to wait and, you know, whatever it takes to find the right car. Okay. Because. So the lady who does my [OCCUPATION] trades. Let me see what I can do. Because the lady that does my [OCCUPATION] trades. And again, I apologize. She. And I can't blame her. She went for a grandson's graduation party today. So. So she's unavailable. I'll be able to touch base with her on Wednesday. Okay, sure. Is that okay? Yeah. Okay, give me your full name so I don't make any mistakes. Okay. It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Last name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, easy. Okay. Yeah. 121. Okay. Now if I may ask you any particular colors? Light? Dark. Yeah, I like the silver. That. Lunar silver. Metallic. I do like that a lot. Perfect. Or black. Okay. I don't like white or red. No, that's fine. So the. Yeah, so the silver mostly comes with the black interior. Is that okay Black leather? Oh, yeah, I would prefer. Okay. Over gray. Okay, Absolutely. Yeah. I really do appreciate the call. Give me [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] to work on this and I promise you I'll have some definite definitive answer because I may be able to trade for one because I have them incoming. So it's no big deal. Okay, cool. Yeah, no problem. Thank you. I appreciate it. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, you're welcome. Without having met first. So I appreciate it. Oh, you got it. No problem at all.

And I'm just trying to make sure this vehicle gets removed from my name because someone else has bought it and I had a terrible time. They drove it to [LOCATION], went through tow road and didn't pay. So I was getting billed for the toes, and we were trying to get it fixed. So I talked with the state, and it's not registered to me, but they said if. If my name's popping up anywhere, because I still get, you know, wanting extended warranties on, and I get all kinds of stuff, so.

Someone else is probably purchased it. And I had a lot of trouble because they drove it in [LOCATION] and they went through the tow roads without paying for anything. So I was getting billed for it. I've talked to the state.

Thanks for calling [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] speaking. How can I help? Yeah, [PERSON_NAME], good morning. This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Hey. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, I hear you like everybody else. Yeah. So you called me for. What is it? What? What was it? What do we have a car that was. That we're looking at, or. It looks like you had submitted an application for an approval. Right. So based on your income and time, you have a really good chance of getting approved for a vehicle. That being said, I have over like 100 vehicles on my lot, both new and pre owned. But there's a little bit more information that we need to get you fully approved. And I can kind of gather, I mean, most of that over this call. It's pretty. Pretty simple because it shows income about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is that accurate? Right. Because I work for [ORGANIZATION] up here in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], so, you know, my hourly is [MONEY_AMOUNT] overtime. Nice job saying doing another company is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah, I work like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] a week out of that, so I. Yeah, actually, just looking at what they just sent me, money wise, I get paid every week. So if you put all that together monthly, you're looking at about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'll say conservative. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Yeah. So you definitely qualify for the approval based on income. Right, Right. It's decent. Plus, I work in the movie industry, too. So since we're on strike, as everyone knows, at this point, at this time, I gotta hate to strike shit. So, yeah, I've been working with them [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, very nice, very nice. And then where are you at credit wise? Do you know where your [ORGANIZATION] score is at? Oh, God, that's awful. Yeah. How awful? You know, because I alpha. Like, are we talking 300? Are we talking [MONEY_AMOUNT]? [MONEY_AMOUNT]? I'll say [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The lowest I've seen on one of them was on [ORGANIZATION]. I think that was at a [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then a lower on. I think. I don't know if it was exifacts [PHONE_NUMBER] to [PHONE_NUMBER]. I got it somewhere. I haven't looked at it lately. I think it was at a [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I think that was the lowest. So the highest was [ORGANIZATION]. I think I can look and see, but I know you guys go through. I don't know what you guys. How you guys do that stuff, because when I say it, it's like apples to oranges. You guys say, no, that's not what we look at. And then I'm like, well, we're looking at [ORGANIZATION] or we're looking at the same thing. He said no. So we got a different one. So you guys got a different outlook on it. I don't know. Yeah, and that's the thing. You know, typically people will tell me their credit's one thing, and then once we pull it, it's another thing. And depending on what lender we're using, it's kind of up to them of what score they're going to look at. That being said, you live here in [LOCATION]. I heard you say something earlier about [LOCATION]. Well, yeah, because I do work in [LOCATION]. I mean, people do it all the time now. We fly in and out for work. There's no damn work in [LOCATION]. Then I got to go where the money's at. Yeah, of course, of course. Okay. Just making sure. I had a good understanding of that. With that being said, what I can do is I can send you a credit application which will give me access to actually see the credit. And the good thing about us is we're a pretty large nationwide company. So our pool with the banks in regards to getting car deals approved is pretty large. You know, I've gotten deals done here that I definitely couldn't get done at another dealership. And that would be a good place to start. Unless you're available sometime today or this weekend to come on by and check out some vehicle options. Here's the unfortunate part. I just signed myself to [DURATION] [DURATION] out here in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] because I'm covering stuff for everybody. So, you know, I gotta make my money first. I'm not trying to. Of course I got a car. Yeah, dude, I got a car. I got a nice Magnum already. That's a classic, and I want to keep it that way. That's why I was looking at something else. I don't want to drive it, you know, around as much as she's the baby. I like to just keep it as a classic car. Yeah. So that's why. Yeah. That. They don't make them anymore. They don't make a Magnum anymore. So that's why I'm like, I don't want to run it to the ground. Yeah, no, I hear you. I'm looking at stuff. So I decided, you know, go ahead. Sorry. No, I was gonna mention where you're at. I mean, getting, you know, another vehicle will help boost the credit. And if you don't need, you know, a loaded, you know, super expensive car or anything like that, it wouldn't be, you know, a bad game plan for you. We can get you into a car just to kind of get around it and help build credit. Right. Would make sense, you know. Yeah, no, I hear you. But here's the thing. At [MONEY_AMOUNT] years old, I'm not trying to take some shit car either. So what I'm looking for is a charger. It has the RT mileage. I can understand. It's gonna be a little high. I get it. If it's under. If it's under a hundred thousand, then we can deal with. Don't have to be [LOCATION] making new. It don't. But it's got to be an rt. It won't. I can't. I'm not driving anything else. RT and above. I'll stick. I'll stick to the rt. You go to [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. We all know how much those cars cost. They know they're well over the [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. We're not doing it. But are you okay with like an RT Scat pack? Just get a regular RT like I have with the magnet. Just a regular rt. I don't need all that other fancy to it because it gets it start getting expensive, dude. You know that. Come on. Here's the thing. Let me. Let me go ahead and take. What type of payment range are you looking to be in? What's the budget? The highest I'll do is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's pretty decent, dude. [MONEY_AMOUNT]? Absolutely. It's realistic. It is. Given where you're at credit wise, you realize that you may have to put some type of money down to get there. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], okay. That's sufficient. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You got 500amonth. [DURATION] [DURATION]. I've done the math a little bit. I'm like, that can work. You got a car run into [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Anywhere from [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I know what the tax. If you go [MONEY_AMOUNT], it's going to range up to about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right. Sorry. Repeat that again for me. I'm figuring. But we're getting a help. Let's just say it's not a [ORGANIZATION]. If we're getting an RT, let's just say 25,000. I'm sure they're going to bump it up to at least another 5,6000. So we're probably gonna be looking at roughly [MONEY_AMOUNT] for that car. That's what I'm thinking. That sounds about right. Yeah. Typically, yeah. 10%. And that, that's pretty close to your, your out the door cost. Yeah. And then. So you're going to be back here in [DURATION] [DURATION], back in [LOCATION]. Right. I'll be back on the [DATE]. On the [DATE] I'm going to set a note. I'm going to keep my eyes open. I have the closest thing that I have to what you're looking for. [DATE_INTERVAL] Charger Daytona. Take a look here. Just right at 100,000 miles. I have a bunch of SFTs. And then I have the SCAT pack here also. But we. The scat pack that I have is at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The Daytona package that I have is at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's okay. I don't have pictures of it up yet because we just got it. But I'm going to be taking a walk around the lot here shortly. I'll send those your way. And within [DURATION] [DURATION], I can almost guarantee you that I'm gonna have some chargers for you because they come and they go so quickly. Yeah, everybody wants to charge you now. I mean everybody's been trying to hit me up to want to buy my Magnum and I'm like, that's all that. No, I remember back in the day my dad worked at a [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] and yeah, the Magnums were like the hottest thing out. Yep. I'm not telling it to the kids to get it. I'm like, you're not getting it. Yep. Sorry. Yeah. Never, never and never. Yeah, it's right. The only. My second option would be the Durango. Same thing. I would go with rt. Yeah. Let's see here. Durango. Yeah, I'll go with Durango on that as a second option. Okay. So yeah, we definitely have options available. I have like six Durangos available right now. Pre owned rt. And you're only RT only. Okay. Yeah, I'll keep my eye out. Yeah, I mean it doesn't do me no good to have us go from RT to down to a 6v6. It just. It ain't. No. Yeah, no, I hear you. I hear that's our goal. We want to help you get into the car that you want, so that won't be an issue. And I don't care about the color. I just want it to be an rt. Okay, yeah, we can work with that, definitely. So, yeah, I'll keep. I have the notes in. I'm gonna set up an inventory check here, like, periodically to keep my eye out for you. And then, let's see here. I think I sent the text opt in. Yeah, I sent a text opt in. Okay. And just. I don't have any kind of, like, evictions. I don't have any card notes. I don't have none of that shit. My rent I pay is 1800amonth for the place. Okay. So, I mean. Yeah, I mean, you definitely sound like you're in position to do so. We just got a. Find the car that you want and then make it, you know, fit within the budget and fully get you approved. That's going to be the hard part. But we have people here that can help us with that. Well, here's the thing. If I don't get approved, then I don't get approved. I mean, I just started looking. I mean, there's somebody between here to [LOCATION] [LOCATION] that will approve me. I'm not going to worry about it. I just. I just wanted to see if there's something out there available. A lot of you saying, don't buy a car right now, but I'm like, I kind of want to buy one now. I want to see what's out there. And if it's too crazy, like everybody's saying, then I'll just sit and wait. I mean, it's not something. I'm like, oh, my God, I got to have a car right now. Yeah. I mean, I've been in the car business [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION], and it seems like every year somebody says that. You know what I mean? Yeah, I know. That's why I said I'm just waiting. Exactly. And that's why I figure I just, you know, we'll have a discussion about it and then if it comes around, great. If not, I got the Magnum. I don't drive the Magnum as much because, I mean, it stays parked. It's in the shade underneath. I don't drive it that much anymore. I just kind of. I drive it on the weekend when I'm in town. Nice. Okay. Well, yeah, I mean, like I said we'd be Happy to help. We have cars. We have, you know, Chargers and Durangos. Thing is, I just got to find an RT for you. Yeah. And, yeah, I mean, I think we have a good opportunity to. To help you get into what you're looking for. And I'll go. I'll go another $[MONEY_AMOUNT] more, so. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [PERSON_NAME], for the. For a monthly payment max. Okay. That should be. Well, that's well enough. Yeah. No, I would agree. I would agree. You know, somewhere in that [MONEY_AMOUNT] range would put [MONEY_AMOUNT] down. Definitely sounds doable. Yeah. And again, it is kind of finding a car that you like. Yeah. And we're not doing [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's gonna be [MONEY_AMOUNT] the highest. And paint is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's it. I know. Okay. Yeah, that's [PERSON_NAME]. I can work with that. That's realistic. You know what I mean? We're not asking for our car payment or something, so. Yeah, I've done the map. You're paying for it. It is what it is. I get it. Yeah. Yeah, that's. That's the thing I like about cars. It's just math, you know, so. Okay. Well, yeah, I'm gonna keep my eye out. As soon as I find, you know, a car that we discussed, I'm gonna make sure to send it your way. And then [DURATION] [DURATION] from now is looking, like, around somewhere between, you know, the [DATE] and the [DATE] [DATE] next month, so we'll be talking periodically. Yeah. And then what you said there. You're sending me some paperwork so you can start working on it, and I'll send you all the check stubs and all that, if you can see it, and. And then whoever you need to talk to where I work at, and they can verify whatever. Yep. And I actually. I just emailed you the credit application that is going to. Yep. Yep. Okay, Perfect. Yep. You should receive that in your email. If you don't see it in your inbox, make sure to check the spam folder. And. Yeah, go ahead and submit that information. That'll give me access to see the credit. Then once I find the car that you're looking for, you know, I can work on getting you fully approved. All right. And don't. One thing. Do not. Yes. Bring me a yellow car. No yellow. [PERSON_NAME] enough. Do not bring me some very yellow rt. I go. That's. I think that's the one thing. I'll just be like, dude, we just can't do this. That's the deal breaker. We just can't. We won't. Any color but a damn Yellow? Yeah, they have it out there. I've seen it. I've seen. Oh, yeah, I know. But [ORGANIZATION] makes good colors. I mean, whether it's, you know, yellow, green, or purple. Nope, nope, nope. Yeah, no. Canary yellow. No, that. No. I'm sorry. We can go with any other color, but we won't do that. We can go burgundy, we can go blue, you can go red, you can go green, navy. Anything but yellow. Anything but yellow car. Okay. Yeah, that won't be an issue. That won't be an issue. I got you. All right, great. Okay, perfect. Well, thanks for reaching back. No, I. I hear you. I know you are. That I'm. I'm in that same boat. I don't think you can pay me to drive a yellow car. Yeah. Look like [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. No, I'm not doing that out here. Pulling taxis, you know? Yeah, I got you. I'll do. I'll make sure that the vehicle is definitely not yellow, and then. Yeah, other than that, I'll find you an RT pack, and then we'll get you on the road. All right. Just a basic RT pack. You don't have to be all the fancy stuff. Regular rt. Yeah, I know it. I got you regular RT with the va. Yep. Yes, I hear you. Cool. All right, well, thanks. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for reaching back out. And then make sure you opt into that text message, too. It looks like I sent it yesterday or [DURATION] [DURATION] ago at [TIME]. You just go ahead and type in yes. And that'll give us access to text back and forth, too. I don't think so. Okay. I saw that. I didn't pay attention too much. Okay, no worries. I'm the same way. No issue. Cool. All right, well, I'll talk to you soon. Hope you have a good rest of the week, and we'll see you in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you. Have a good. Cool. You're welcome. You as well.

We're not gonna be able to look at it today. Okay, well, I'm getting a tow truck to bring it in. I was told you guys maybe had an after hours drop off. Yeah, we have a night drop. It's.

I'm going to send out an email to my [OCCUPATION] so that when they come in on Monday they'll see if I schedule an appointment. My first available appointment is not until Tuesday, so it's going to be a lot easier to do it this way so that they know. Because a lot of times the lady I'm going to send this to, she can get you worked in sooner. So I'm going to save your information but then I'm going to email her and let her know you're having it towed in. Okay. What color is the pilot? Black. And what's the vehicle doing? It started to stall out. Kind of not wanting to go any faster at about 30, 35, and then the check engine light has come on and is blinking. Oh yeah. Are you all driving it? We were, but then we just, we just stopped and I was advised if it's blinking I shouldn't drive it. So we called it. You should turn it. Yeah. If it's blinking the check engine light or the letter D ever, you need to shut it off immediately. Okay. I'm sitting in the car right now, not driving it, but it's running. Should I turn it off? Yes. Just because you couldn't like ruin the transmission or the engine that way. I'm sorry. Say that part again. So if there's ever a letter D flashing or the check engine lights flashing, immediately shut it off, because you can blow the transit or the engine or the transmission. Okay. By letting it run. Just future reference. Alright, so I'm going to send this over to her and I'm going to put your contact information in here and all that in the email. And then I created you an account and I just let her know what was going on. And she'll probably give you a call Monday. Her name is [PERSON_NAME]. If not, call up here on Monday and ask for her, because she's going to be the one that's going to probably check it in, I can almost guarantee you. Okay. All right. That sounds good.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yes, hi. Can you check if you have any base Impreza hatchbacks? Yes, we do. You do? What [OCCUPATION] do you have? Let me see. Have you been looking for a while or just started? No, I actually, I have a deal pretty much that or with [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. I'm just trying my luck to see if maybe you guys have a. Or would offer me a lower MSRP for it. Okay, cool. What was your name, by the way? [PERSON_NAME]. Cool. My name's [PERSON_NAME]. Let me see. I know for certain. I believe we have white. Let me see. See what other ones that we have. What? Is there a color you're looking for? As long as it's not one of those colors that gets dirty super fake. Like black. Black, like the magnetite gray. Let me see. Can you. Can you hold for one sec? I'm just going to check really quick. Okay. Yeah. So we still have. So right now we have magnetite gray metallic. That's the one that's like the closest to black, but the. The dark gray metallic. And we have crystal white pearl. Okay, how much is. What's the msrp? Let me see. For which one. Which one are you leaning towards? Probably Y. Honestly, either one would be fine. Whichever one has the lower msrp. Okay, let me see. Okay, so the white one, it does have a little lower MSRP. The MSRP on it is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And then you said you had an offer you wanted us to be. Yeah, so they're [MONEY_AMOUNT] because they have the same MSRP. The thing is, I hadn't bought a W. I had bought a W X there. So they're. Yeah, they were doing [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And just. Just to clarify, because I know, like, I don't think [ORGANIZATION] does this. Especially not. This wasn't done with my wrx. But you guys don't add any, like, packages or, or like, accessories to the vehicles, right? Oh, no, no. There wouldn't be any, like, markups or anything like that. Okay.

So if you schedule a service or a maintenance, we'll come pick up the vehicle and bring it back to you so you don't have to. You know, a lot of people these days are working from home, and it's just a courtesy of not having to wait around, you know, a service drive for, you know, [DURATION] [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION], sometimes [DURATION] [DURATION] for whatever. Yeah, whatever happens to be. So they'll come pick it up and back off to your house. Yeah. Okay. You don't have a dealership anywhere near me. I don't have a dealership near you. Look at. Look at [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. See where your. [PERSON_NAME]. Nearest [OCCUPATION] is. But either way, you weren't charged for that. Okay, so why is. Why does it show up on there? That's what I don't understand. How is it not charged? To me, the discount of the vehicle online is [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The discount he's showing you here is [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. All right, so he's discounting all of that. So it's. The cost of that stuff is discounted up top, guys. Okay, so. But if it's added back in. Okay, so. So what you're saying is, is I'm paying the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] minus the discount. Correct. Okay. So that if that has no bearing on me, why can it not just be knocked off even more? Because what if I take the [MONEY_AMOUNT] at [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] off of there? I have to change. I have to lower my discount by $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So we raised our discount by [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] to offset the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] in cost of those accessories. So I can lower my discount down to [MONEY_AMOUNT] and make the Accessories like not even appear on here and your bottom line is still going to be [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, I understand what you're saying. Tell me about the taxable fees. Estimated. What are the taxable fees? Taxable fees are basically an electronic filing fee. There's a new tire fee that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] charges when we sell a car here. There's a lead battery acid charge and then the non tax fees are an estimated [ORGANIZATION]. We don't know what your tag is going to be till we submit it over to the [ORGANIZATION]. So you know my taxes are going to be on the. Yeah, the [ORGANIZATION] taxes are going to be what you've got figured there, [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] if that's right. So. And then I don't know what the [ORGANIZATION] is going to charge for a tag yet until we submit either a transfer plate or whatever. We have to submit that over to them directly. Yeah, that's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. [LOCATION] is pretty cheap on, on car tax, so I'm paying [MONEY_AMOUNT] times [MONEY_AMOUNT]. See myself, my sale price, my sale price is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] times [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, we probably need to leave it alone. I mean they're going to submit it straight in. We have a program called DLR50 and that is linked to every [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. So once [ORGANIZATION] gets a hold of everything like license, insurance, everything, we can submit everything over to the [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] will get everything down to the penny back to us. These are just estimated based off the zip code. Yeah, yeah. And it figures it, it figures it somewhat wrong because they say I live in the city and I don't. So. Right. Yeah. And also, can your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] or your, your, that department take the file for the used car sales tax credit in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] that I get for selling my truck? I have no idea. That would be a question for them. Once we. I don't even know. I finally stumped it. That's what I was going for. That was my whole deal today. Stump somebody. I just don't handle that kind of stuff. I don't, I don't know the answer to it. There's a whole department that, that's what they're certified and licensed to do. Okay, so what, what does it take? What's the deposit take to hold this truck? I'm trying to find out when it's going to be here. That's the part I can't figure out. How soon do you need this vehicle? Well, I'm waiting on a few things. I sold my truck to my son, so I can pretty much take it back anytime I want. He hadn't paid me for it yet. I'm flexible. Here's what I'm trying to figure out is I'm gonna fly to. If. If we can work this deal out. I'm gonna fly to [LOCATION] to pick this up, and I want everything taken care of before. I mean, I'm gonna. I won't buy. The [ORGANIZATION] has a nice little airline that I can fly on it for [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] and fly down there and get it. Nice and are you financing with us through [ORGANIZATION]? No, I'm paying ca. Okay. That's the reason why I was asking about that at [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Yeah, I got you. I understand. Let me do a little deeper dive on to when this vehicle is going to be here. I don't have access to the system that tells me what the holdup is. Give me like [DURATION] [DURATION]. And what was the other thing you asked about? A used car. What was it? Used car credit. The [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] gives me a sales tax credit on my new vehicle. They'll give me a sales tax credit for. It's called a sales tax rebate. And it goes. Yeah, I mean, we do it here as well, but only when it's in the deal. There's no way to do it, like, outside of the deal. I don't know. That's okay. I don't know the answer to that. So I'm not even going to speak on it. So let me. Yeah, no, I'm fine. You can. Yeah, you can. You can figure that. You can ask them and see what they say. They may say, hell, no, we don't want to. We don't want to do anything. Anything to do with that. And I'll have to go about it a different route. But, yeah, you might do that yourself. But, yeah, let me. Let me do some inquiry on when the vehicle's going to be here, and give me like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] and I'll call you back. All right. And is this the direct number you'll be calling me from? This. I just called you from my. Well, you called in. What. What number do you have there? I. No, I'll call you. That's my number. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Tell me that again and I'll put it in my phone. [PHONE_NUMBER] and I'm sorry, what was your name again? My name is [PERSON_NAME], sir. All right. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. Thank you.

Your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], [PERSON_NAME], or new car? No, no, no. I'm a new car guy. New car. Okay. Yeah, it was you and me that spoke.

"Thank you for calling, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] in [ORGANIZATION]. How can I help you? Hi, I just called [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] earlier inquiring about the two cars and I don't remember, to be honest, who was talking to me, but they asked about their stock number to see if they're available and they got them. So could you search it for me? Yeah, give me one second, I'll pull that up for you. Is it a pre owned or is it a new car? It's a used car. Both of them. Perfect. Yeah. All right, let's see. All right, what's the first stock number that you have there? So [ORGANIZATION] [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] Bravo. Do you want me to repeat that? What was the first letter? L. L for? Look. Okay. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] Bravo. Yes, it's [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Accord EX with a mileage of 160, 165. Okay, let's see. To be honest, I don't know if they're sold or not. They were not on the website anymore. Okay, Yeah, I see the car, the [ORGANIZATION] Accord. Let me see. The show. Is available on my end, but definitely I would want to confirm by actually putting my hands on the vehicle because, you know, it could say it's available on our computer system, but it could have been sold today. Let me just check here. Let me check something real quick. I can have my [OCCUPATION] check, though, to see if it was. Pick your time. There's no rush at all. There's no rush at all. And what was the. Let me go ahead and take the second stock number for me and I'll check on both of those. The second also was on the website, but now it is not. It was [VEHICLE_ID] [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] [VEHICLE_ID]. It was also an [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Accord with the [VEHICLE_ID], sorry, the [VEHICLE_ID] with a mileage of 116,914. Perfect. Okay. Yeah, those [ORGANIZATION] Accords, they sell fast. Let's see. Yeah. All right, so let me just pull these up real quick here. I'm not even showing the other one on our website anymore. The first one that you gave me. Let me see. All right, I'm going to check on both these stock numbers. So I'm going to go to my [OCCUPATION] real quick and have them check those. I'm going to put you on a breathe hold. Okay, Take your turn. I'll be right back. Hello, sir. Hello, I'm here. Hey. Okay, so I pulled. I checked both of the stock numbers and they look like they're both. They're Both here, there's no deals on them, so they haven't been sold. So really the only other question is if they've passed inspection or if they've gone to auction. A lot of times with these higher mileage vehicles, if they don't pass the safety inspection, they go to auction. So that's really the only other thing that we'd have to check on. But so far everything's so good on both of those stock numbers. We have both of them here and they both have not been sold. So both are. Did you want to get see the vehicles? Yeah, I would love to come in and see the vehicles. So I was just gonna, if that's the like the case, can like, can you guys put them again on the website? Because like I can't even look up, like I can't even see that. See them again on the website. And I, to be honest, I don't have like lots of photos for the, for the, for the first one that you gave me because I don't see the second one. So that one could have went to auction. Let me see, Give me just a second. Let me see if I can find that first one that you gave me because I can. More pictures the vehicles. So just to be clear, so I can understand the situation, both of them were removed off the website because according to now, both of them haven't passed inspection. So they're going to auction to be sold or going to auction to be fitted with a good inspection? No. So yeah, if they pass the inspection, we retail the vehicle. So we sell them here. But if they fail to save the inspection, we usually send them to auction. So we don't sell them at our dealership. But both of these vehicles appear to be. Let me see. That's what I'm trying to check now to see if we are retailing them. Give me just a second. Take your turn. Okay. Sir. Yes, Hello. Looks like you're working. The person you were speaking to earlier, his name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Looks like that's who you're speaking with. But I did check on both of those cars. The first one that had no air condition and no AC is going to auction and the second one is also going to auction. So we're not going to be selling both, either of those vehicles. But we have quite [DURATION] [DURATION] more Accords here. So I would definitely say to come on down and take a look at what we have because a lot of our cars aren't on the website just yet. So if you do come in, you can take a look at what we have on the trade lot, what we have waiting to go through the shop and everything. I think you find something here. Okay, that would be great. That would be great. Do you want to come in today or tomorrow? Probably on Saturday. Because I'm a [OCCUPATION] and I'm in [ORGANIZATION] and I currently have, like, lots of classes for this summer, so. Yeah, Saturdays. Okay. What time Saturday works for you? Morning or afternoon? Probably afternoon. Does [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] work for you? Looks like you have some availability at [TIME]. Is it by appointment? Yeah, yeah, it's by appointment. I can put a tentative time in there and have them follow up with you on Friday, just to confirm then. Yeah, just do a tentative one. I'm probably going to confirm it on Friday. Yeah. Okay. I'll have to call you on Friday to confirm the time. Okay. Yeah, this will be perfect. I have your phone number. Yes, this is it. Perfect. And then I'll also have them follow up if there's any other Accords that pop up. It looks sounds like you're looking for an Accord somewhere in that [DURATION] range. Yes. And also, I don't know if you guys could add this to the list if you have, like, either a Hyundai, Elantra or Sonata. Oh, yeah, yeah. We get those all the time. Yeah, those three models would be amazing. Oh, and can we add one more? I'm very sorry. Yeah. [ORGANIZATION] Forte. What you got models from like, [DATE_INTERVAL] or [DATE_INTERVAL] until, like, [TIME]. Okay. Yeah, those are the full models. All right. I put a note here for [PERSON_NAME] so he'll follow up with you. I'll definitely have them call you by Friday to confirm the time for Saturday. Okay, yes, that would be great. Thank you so much.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi, my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I was calling to speak to [PERSON_NAME]. He is actually on a call right now. You came in last night to take a look at some pre owned Accords, correct? I did. I did. Okay. All right. Give me just one second. He just jumped off the call. Let me tell him you're on the phone. Okay? Okay, thank you. Mm. Sa. Hey, Ms. [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, [PERSON_NAME]. How are you? I'm doing fine. I understand you came in last night. And I had a quick conversation with one of the [OCCUPATION] this morning, and he has a vehicle in mind. He's in the process of sending the information to the bank so we can see if we can get an approval for you. Now what? What we need to find out from you. And I know they asked you all these questions last night, but you and I already had a conversation about this. But when would be the earliest you could do any money down? That's what I told. Oh, gosh. Now I can't remember his last. That would be [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. Yes, I have last night and I still have it today. I have [MONEY_AMOUNT] in cash right now that I could put down with the trade. And the highest, I mean, that I could go is like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] more right now. Now. Okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead. What's your payment on the car I have now? Yes, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. So the most you would be willing to do in a payment is [MONEY_AMOUNT]? Yeah. Okay, well, I was. I can go just a little higher, but just not too much higher. Okay. You're trying to be less than [MONEY_AMOUNT]? Yes, if possible. All right. And okay, now. Now I'm going to delve into your personal business. When is your car payment due? It is due. [DATE], the [DATE] of every [DURATION]. Okay, so you just made it. Yes. Okay. Okay, so you just made that one. Okay. And I guess you probably mentioned this last night. You don't have anyone that could go on the loan with you whose score might be higher? Not who scores higher? No. My [MARITAL_STATUS]. He doesn't have any car loans, but he doesn't have a credit score. Like, a good credit score. Okay. And you're sure? And the reason I'm saying that, you'd be amazed how many people come in and they tell me they have no credit. And I pull their information. They have credit. They think their credit is bad, and their credit actually is not that bad. They've never bought a car, but they have a higher credit score. Does he have a Credit card? No, I just know from when I bought the Passat, we attempted to put him on there and they stated that he wouldn't. It wouldn't help at all. At all. Okay. Him going on wouldn't. Wouldn't help. Right. Okay. Now, does he have a car currently? It's a vehicle that I. I have. It's like it's in my name, if that makes sense. Okay. Okay. Is it an open auto loan? Is it paid for? No, it's an open auto loan with [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And we just. We just got that vehicle back on the road. And I just got caught up with those payments as well. Okay, okay. All right. How much is the payment on that one? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, let's see, let's see, let's see. About how much does he make [DURATION] [DURATION]? He's [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], so it varies. Okay. How long has he been [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]? Roughly [DURATION] [DURATION]. [DURATION] [DURATION]. Roughly. About [DURATION]. About [DURATION] [DURATION]. What does he do? What does he do? Home renovations. See, I knew right before I asked you that I was thinking. I was thinking in my head, I was like, I'm betting he does what I'm looking to have somebody do, because I'm looking for somebody that can do sheetrock. And so it was like, as soon as you said that, I was like, God Almighty. Where does he live? Where do you guys live? We live in [LOCATION], but he. Right now he's in [LOCATION] working, but he travels. He has to go to [LOCATION] [LOCATION] sometimes, so he's everywhere. All right, mention to him that, you know a person that's looking to have a small amount of sheetrock work done, and I'm gonna tell you what happened. I have a. I have a stepson that's in a wheelchair. And he came to stay with us for about [DURATION] [DURATION]. And he was trying to get into the downstairs bathroom, and he rested his weight against the toilet paper holder. So he pulled it out from the wall on just one side, but the sheetrock in that spot is missing. And I think that's where the stud is that it was bolted to. Okay, so I need the sheetrock repaired, and I need somebody that can look at it and tell me whether or not they can use all the same components I have and just put it back on there. Okay. So if that's. If that's something that's up his alley, you can let him know, he can give me a shout and I can try to meet him. Meet him at the house and show him what I'm talking about. And he can quote me a price, that sort of thing. So bounce that off of him. Okay. But I'm gonna get back to. Yeah, great, great, great. Okay. Well, I mean, now I feel like I'm helping you buy a car here. So as soon as I have to talk to my [OCCUPATION] and. And we have a chance to talk with the bank, we'll be back in touch. Now, are you working today? I am. And I was gonna, but I work from home, so. Okay. Oh, okay. Okay. I'm free until [TIME] [TIME]. [TIME] [TIME] until [TIME]. I have meetings, but I'm free until [TIME] [TIME] dot okay. Okay. All right. Well, I will either call or text if I have a question. Now, you said you live in [LOCATION], which side of town? I'm right here off [LOCATION] [LOCATION], maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] from you guys. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm over off of a [LOCATION] ferry. That's the reason why I was asking. So I'd know kind of or gauge how far we were apart. So if he decided he wanted to stop by, I could work that out. But anyhow, I will be back in touch. Okay. What's your. Can I get your phone number, [PERSON_NAME]? Sure, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll give you my cell. Yeah, that's fine. My cell phone numbers. [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER] and [PERSON_NAME], what's your last name? Last name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. All right. Okay, awesome. Thank you. All right, if he's bored and doesn't have anything to do and wants to make a few extra [MONEY_AMOUNT], then just tell him, give me a shout and tell him I pay cash and he don't have to wait. I'm sorry, what'd you say? No, you. Fine. I was gonna say he will help you any way he can. He loves. Well, no, no, no. I'm all about paying people for their work. So just tell him I'm not trying to get a freebie. So if he gets freed up and he needs some little light work to fill a spot, tell him to give me a shout and we can get it worked out. Yeah.

"Thank you. Yes, I was. I was talking to [PERSON_NAME] and. Seems like we got cut off or disconnected. Hold just a moment. Now let's read. Verse 13 is conveniently located on the [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Now, where did you say my car is? I mean, that car is. That's what I was saying. We. We don't know where your car is. Your car was not brought here to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] for service. We focus on spiritual things, the sum total of human experience and wisdom. You mean philosophies and teachings. The guy from the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], the one called me, telling me he was going to come pick it up. And you're telling me. Okay, so I guess I need to talk to the financial people, right? You're saying you haven't seen the car, right? No, ma' am. The car. This is [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. You know, we purchase cars and we do service here. And the car is not here. It was. It wasn't brought here for any service or anything. Well, I know that, [PERSON_NAME]. I told you yesterday that I was calling to see you had anybody inspected the car. You told me. Hold on. And you was going in the back and talking somebody and you would get back to me, which you did not. Now, I don't care where the car is because I got evidence that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I got evidence that someone from your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] called and said that they were coming to pick [PERSON_NAME] up. Now, I don't care. Credit car is. Who do I talk to, [PERSON_NAME], to get this situation taken care of? No, it sounds like you're supposed to be dealing with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], the store. Well, how come we examine that? Yesterday you asked me was your car. I thought you bought your car here for service, and you asked. No, I did not. I did not. I have never told you that the car was there for service. I have told you ever since I picked the car up that we. I brought it out there the day I picked it up for you to come and inspect the cars. You were not there. Okay. I called you several times about coming out there to solve this situation with the car. And unfortunately, I had had a fall. I haven't been able to come. But what I'm trying to figure out. You say I don't talk to you anymore. Who do I talk to? [PERSON_NAME]? So, I mean, I. I believe I spoke with your son before as well, and, you know, I let him know that you're supposed to be talking with the people at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Why didn't you tell me that yesterday when I called instead of telling me you're gonna check on it and come back and let me know. Now, today you're going back last week about when my son was here telling me what you think.

First of all, [PERSON_NAME], you all. [PERSON_NAME], Listen, [PERSON_NAME], first of all, you told me my agreement was up on [DATE_INTERVAL]. I can't. I gotta go back to my contract. And all this time when the car was in the shop, you're talking about having a car, inspecting all this? Okay? Now, you got the car. And you don't know nothing about having any space. You don't even know who I need to talk to to get this. This taken care of. Now, I'm not stupid, [PERSON_NAME]. I might be old, but I got the contract. And if y' all don't get whoever got it, if they don't call me and get this taken care of next week, we're gonna, you know, we're gonna get to whoever I need to talk to. Because, you know, y' all come off as, you know, helping people in this land. And now you come here talking like you don't know nothing about what I'm talking about.

Why didn't you say that yesterday instead of telling me so going in the back and coming. Why did you say that yesterday? See, this is the problem. Y' all trying to, you know, get hope on me. Number one, what started this whole thing ain't no problem until back in [DATE_INTERVAL], they come up taking two payments out of my account, being lied and said that they didn't. Now, back to you. You sold the car. I didn't talk to you all along. And you told me so many different lies, I don't even think you'll know what you said, [PERSON_NAME].

"Thank you for holding. This is [PERSON_NAME] speaking. Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm interested in, like, a GLC 300 on your website. Okay. Yeah. So am I talking to the right person, like a [OCCUPATION] or. Yeah, yeah, I'm one of the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Yeah, I'd be happy to help you. Yeah, yeah. That's great. So I signed one of the new GLC [DATE_INTERVAL]. GLC 300. Price is MSRP [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] on your left side. Yeah. Do you need the stock number or the wing number to ID it? Yes, whichever one is easier for you. Okay. The stock number is [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Okay, awesome. And then what about that particular vehicle, I guess, caught your eye or are you interested in the most? This car is, I think. Oh, okay. Like the color I see. Okay. No, no, no. Okay. So I am. I'm actually in [LOCATION], so I'm looking for a new GLC 300. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'm like, just happened to be visiting this website and found. I like this one. I want to give it a call and try. Okay, let me just see here. Sorry, I'm just logging in real quick. Just taking a few minutes here. No worries. So, like, because I never buy a car in [LOCATION], just want to know, like, in addition to the MSRP on the website, what are the other costs? Like, the additional to this? Yeah. So, you know, even though, you know, we're in [LOCATION], so you were you looking at financing, paying cash, leasing the vehicle? How about cash? Okay, so cash. So I guess it's really easy. What we do is we just break it down without the taxes, and then basically we'll just have you register it in [LOCATION], and then at that time, you can pay the tax on it. You mean I. You can do the registration for [LOCATION] there in the store? What we do is, I mean, it's possible that we can charge tax on a cash deal, everything like that. But what we do offer up is that you can do it yourself. We can send it to a [ORGANIZATION] of your choice and then you can register it. Yeah, so in that case, like, I need to, like, drive it to [LOCATION] and do the registration myself. So I think I was thinking, like, I should get another, like, plate number from [LOCATION] first and then come back to [LOCATION] and do the registration. Is that correct? You wouldn't need to register it in [LOCATION] and get a plate from [LOCATION] and then do it in [LOCATION]? What we can do is offer up what's called a trip permit to basically have it in lieu of a plate. Until you register it in [LOCATION]. Oh, okay. Okay. And how long this will be effective for? I think it's [DURATION] [DURATION]. [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. And then like how about insurance? Can I have insurance with it? Yeah. Well, what we do is, what we try to do is we try to get everything settled ahead of time. So purchase of the vehicle, insurance, all that information, and then what we'll do is either one of two things, right? We can offer up a quote for shipping. So if you're looking to ship it from our dealership to maybe even your home, we could do that. And then, you know, that way you already have insurance on the vehicle for when it's transport. Now if you wish to drive it from [LOCATION] to [LOCATION], you definitely can do that too, if you choose. We just, most of our customers from [LOCATION] do choose to have it shipped there. I mean, I know it's kind of a drive right from [LOCATION] all the way over there. I'm sorry, how much is the shipping? Maybe about A$150 per mile. So that's usually what they. They quote us on average. So however far the distance. Yeah, Sorry, what, what, what, what's the price you just mentioned? A [MONEY_AMOUNT]. A [MONEY_AMOUNT] to a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] a mile. Per mile. Okay. Ah, that's a good option. Y. Yeah, let me check it out. Like how far it is? Yeah, yeah, that's what. Yeah. Normally if they choose to ship it, how do they finish, like the purchase process? Yeah. So there's a couple ways. So you could pay off the dealership directly and then we can pay the transporter. Or you can choose to pay what we call COD or cash on delivery at time of drop off. You can pay them at that point. But most, most have it done through us. There's no benefit, there's no like discount or anything better way to do it. Most people do it through us. That way when they get their car, they don't have to worry about anything. They just enjoy having their car once it's there. Yeah, yeah, okay, I got it. Yeah. So like, are you on the car's information right now? Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. So I do have it available. It's actually at my storage lot, so I'd have to bring it over. It's not too far away. It's maybe about [DURATION] [DURATION]. But I do show that it is available and it is physically on the ground here. Okay. So like for this car, the MSRP is like what the website shows. And in addition, what else do I pay? I mean, not the, like the shipping. We just talked about. I mean is there any other fees and tax for. Yeah, so there's. Yeah, so there's a dock fee, there's a corporate activity tax, there's an [LOCATION] electronic filing fee and then there's [OCCUPATION] installed options. So on some of them like we have Starguard, which is security system, basically it's a tracking device on the vehicle. It's installed pre installed on all of our new cars and. Yeah, that's it. So like what is the out of door price in total? Yeah, I would have to break that down for you. Okay. Yeah. If you want to give me your information, what I can do is also have a [OCCUPATION] basically type in your information and then I can work out a quote and help you out with that. Quote. Oh good. Yeah, that's great. So if you can break down pricing sheets and maybe give me a quote, I would like maybe a better quote than the website shows if it will be fantastic. Yeah. Okay. And your name? My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and last name [PERSON_NAME]. Last name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And a good telephone number. Okay. And a good email address. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, that's [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Huh. And then consulting. Perfect. Okay, definitely. So let me go ahead and work something up and then I'll have one of our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] reach out to you. Okay, that would be great. If you have any like similar, like stock similar, like GLC but other color or similar price, just feel free to involve that as well. Yeah, yeah. So what I'll have then is I'll have the assessment tool to kind of go over what you know, I guess what other options that you are looking for and then they can help you search for that. Okay. Based on the stock number you gave us. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye.",success,price_quote,GLC 300,medium,False,0a0ae54c63044974be0b31ae71166c68_transcript.json
"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], how may assist you please? Hi, I'd like to speak to somebody about a possible purchase we want, we're interested in but it would be a lease to purchase or whatever you do. Sure, my pleasure. My name is [PERSON_NAME], I can help you with that. May I change your name please? Well it's not for me, it's for my daughter but my name is [PERSON_NAME], so. [PERSON_NAME], you said [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. No, my name is [PERSON_NAME].

Associated to the person that they want to do at least tell you what and until she shows up there and buys it I don't want to give you that information. She knows what she wants and we just have a couple of questions before, before we go over there. So if, if we lease, my [MARITAL_STATUS] is wondering could we pay the [DURATION] [DURATION] of the lease up front and would that change. She's the, the one that she wants to get is the 420X, the 250X. I'm sorry I wrote down the wrong, I read the wrong thing. The NX250, that's what it is, the model NX250. Sure, sure. I'm very familiar with that model. It is amazing car. If she decided to prepay it in advance it would save her a little bit. Not that much but I can show it to her. You know what, I understand you're a [OCCUPATION], but I'm not and I don't like dealing with [OCCUPATION] actually. I just want some straight answers. So we looked up online, it says the NX250 and [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] listed and she services her car there. Well her actually her car was totaled. Somebody hit her recently and her car was totaled. She wants to get another Lexus but we don't. I don't want to haggle with you or anything. I just would like to know, would you? Do you. If we go in there, I know it's a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit. We know that the [DURATION] [DURATION] lease of the car it says is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What would the lease go down to for the [DATE_INTERVAL]? If we pay off the [DURATION] [DURATION] up front and then at the end would pay off whatever has to be paid off. Okay. I have to talk to the management. Would you be able to find out what the difference is? We're just curious if it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT], you know because there's no more interest involved, you know, whatever it is. I'm just. And how many miles do you need for [DURATION] [DURATION]. The 10,000 would be fine. She. She uses it much less than that. Got it. Okay. What will be the zip code? Because we need some of the information. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Play it over. Got it. Okay. 10,000 miles [DURATION] [DURATION], one way paid one. What did you say? She said front wheel drive. Also, I think your that model has a front wheel drive. It does. It does. Okay. The 250 is front wheel drive. So I gave her a number on the base model. 251 way pay. And did you want me to call you at the same number as. Yes, please. If it's showing up, it's [PERSON_NAME]. I already gave you mine. But it's my phone, so it'll come to me directly. Got it. And is there any other question beside that? [PERSON_NAME]? Oh, yes. What would the payoff be in [DURATION] [DURATION]? If you can give us that, Is there a set amount for that also? And if so, what is. We're just trying to decide whether we're going to buy it outright or what we're going to do. So we're trying to figure out what would be best or how we want to handle it. Okay.

"Thank you for calling [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How may I address your call? I was looking online and using Express and we're looking at [ORGANIZATION] Civic Catchback. Okay, hold on one second. Good morning, [PERSON_NAME]. [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi. Hello. This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I was talking to someone [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago now and I've been putting it off, but now I'm looking again. Okay. Civic hatchback. Okay, let me see if I can find who your [OCCUPATION] is real quick. Sure. That way I don't step on any toes. Yeah, me too. I'm sure they appreciate a call back here. Let's see. I don't see it. What's a good phone number for you? All right, it looks like you're just talking to [PERSON_NAME], so I can definitely help you. Okay. Well, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. It's nice to meet you, Mr. [PERSON_NAME]. What question did you have about the hatchback? Well, let's see. I was looking at the white one. Mm. It's a sport touring. Okay. What is the difference between sport and sport touring? So the sport tour, the sport is going to be more of a. It's less option. So the sport will have like cloth interior. It will have. It still has all your safety stuff such as lane keep assist, lane departure mitigation, [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay, you know, adaptive cruise control, stuff like that. Does that have Android? It does. They're both Android or [ORGANIZATION] compatible. And then when you get up to the Sport Touring, that is a little bit more luxury version. So it'll have like your heated seats, leather power seats on both sides, sunroof, wireless charging, just a little bit more fancier version, walk away, auto lock, stuff like that. Oh, okay. Yeah, me too. Which. What's the most popular color? Because I don't like black. White seems to be pretty good. But yeah, I only buy white cars for some reason, I don't know. But like, I drive the white Sport Touring Accord. But I mean, just a preference. I mean, I just personally like it because, you know, I don't know. It's a personal preference for me. Yeah. Sport touring, Accord. That must not be the current year. I know. It is not sport touring, it's not sport touring. It's a. It's just a touring. Hybrid Accord. Yes, sir. Okay. And it's hybrid. I've had several Hondas and over the years, I'm not a spring chicken, so. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well, I can definitely. So the thing, I don't think we have any on the lot at the moment because they go really fast. We had two when we left On. We had two on Friday and then they both sold within that range. They're really fast. So. So what I can do is give me [DURATION] [DURATION] minutes to kind of give me some, do a little bit of research. Let's see. Do you live in [LOCATION]? It says you live in [LOCATION]. Yes. Okay, awesome. Well, I actually delivered three cars last month to like, opalous [LOCATION] area because we were able to beat all their pricing. So I'm familiar with [LOCATION] area and stuff like that. And so what I'll do is I'll kind of check and see what my incoming inventory is in that sport touring hatchback model, and then I can be in touch with you and we can kind of figure out next plan of action from there. Oh, so you don't have any. I don't think I have any here on my wallet at the moment. I have some coming in. Oh, online. It shows one, but I guess it's not. It sold over the weekend. It hasn't updated it yet. Oh, gotcha. Okay. But I definitely can get some in. So what it. What it is is if you decide that you've narrowed it down to a hatchback and you know, you know, the trim levels and stuff that you want, we can. We can reserve one that's coming in. And so it's kind of a really easy process. It's a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] non refundable deposit that you put on the vehicle. But what that does is it guarantees that when it gets here, no one else can drive it, that it's. You get to touch it, feel it, drive it, make sure it's everything that you want it to be anymore before you go in and sign your final paperwork. It's like a big reservation to guarantee that you can have time to get here to look at it and drive it and do all of those things. Okay. So I guess you have the best price in the area. I sure do. I know it. That's the thing to do. Yeah. Is it better to have. I know the. The touring has the turbo engine. The 2 liter is not a turbo. Correct. So it'll have a 1.5 turbo. And then it'll. The other one will have the 2.0 regular, so the other one's a little bit bigger engine, but the one point has the turbo. And how much difference is there between the two when you want to go fast? You know, I've never really noticed the difference. I mean, I've drove both versions. My kids have the regular Sport, you know, 2.0. And then I had the Civic 1.5 touring at 1 point before I got in a car accident and someone took it out for me. But I mean, I loved it. I thought it was great. So I can drive any car and I chose the Civic Touring with my first option. And then someone ran a red light and totaled my car for me, so I had to get another one. Oh yeah. It's unfortunate. So. Yeah. Well, let me do some research, see what else we have coming in. If you have a white one coming in. Okay. Would you have a second choice color as well just in case. Don't like any other colors. Looks like. Okay, that's all right. I'll. Let me. Give me a little bit of time, Mr. [PERSON_NAME], and I'll do a little bit of research and I'll be right reach it out to you. Now, I. I do have a trade in. Okay. And I've been shopping it around for the trade in on different things. Okay. And I kind of know what it's worth. Okay. But are they giving you a different range of the number or they all pretty much on the same page? What have you found? Pretty much the same. Okay. And what is it? Well, the car itself is a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Panamera GTS. Okay. It has the 4.8 liter V8. I can send you the pin. It's been at [ORGANIZATION] and see what y' all can do. Yeah, absolutely. So we'll do what we'll do. Willing to buy from me. Gotcha. For the trade in price, of course. Okay. But what number are they giving you? Just so I'm not. I'm not familiar with that car at all whatsoever. So. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. 55,000. Yeah. MSRP was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh, geez. Okay. Awesome. Yeah, I actually drove a [ORGANIZATION] Bug to [LOCATION] at one point and the dad was trading in his [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Boxster, so I drove that one back all the way from [LOCATION] once. That's the closest I've ever gotten to [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, well, awesome. Well, I'm going to text you my information. I'm going to see what we have coming in and then you can send me your VIN number and stuff like that and we'll definitely send your. I'm a text you. Okay, great. Yes, sir.

Hey, good afternoon, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME] again. Sorry to bother you, but I was asking more questions. Hey, just trying to talk with the [MARITAL_STATUS] about it. So what's the. On the XLE, it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT] off, correct? Off the 52,000. Yes, correct. Yeah. And then I didn't say anything about the 15,000 on the fuel card. How does that work? It's a fuel cart and it's Approximately. It's approximately 15,000. And you apply for it or no. Or do you guys give it to me upon purchase? No application. Okay. And I just. Okay. And I also saw on the incentives on your website on. Not yours, the [ORGANIZATION]. Zero percent financing, of course, for qualified buyers. That. Yeah. Okay. I'm about a 700. My [MARITAL_STATUS] about a 720. Probably not in the range. Okay, but it's not too. I mean, is that something that we would. On the [DATE] of the. What are the usual parameters of the. No, you have perfect credit. You won't. Don't worry about that. You have perfect credit. Yeah. Well, let's just say it's [MONEY_AMOUNT] now, right? I don't really. I just looked at. Not credit card. I'm on my Equifax, so I was just worried to try to get the 0%. Don't worry about that. You got good credit. Okay. You'll get the. Okay. If not, I'll just make the call. I'll call [PERSON_NAME] at [ORGANIZATION] and we'll get to the. Okay, so let's just see. Let's just do the math. Okay. I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Prius plug in. Right. I'd probably trade that in for as a down payment. Right. Okay. Tax and license on the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right. So and then you get the [MONEY_AMOUNT] off at purchase of the vehicle. Correct. Of the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Correct. Yeah. Okay. And then, and then whatever. My Prius would be as a trade in. Right. On something like that. Okay. I'm just trying to figure out my, my, my payment on that. I don't mind. I don't care about. I just want to just kind of get A parameter of where I'm at. You know what I mean? Yeah, no, I get it. I get it. I'm on the same page. What are you, what are you thinking? Like the round ballpark range? So [MONEY_AMOUNT] minus [MONEY_AMOUNT], you're thinking. I'm just trying to get a payment set up. If the 0%. You can't beat that. Let's say you're at $[MONEY_AMOUNT] finance balance divided by [DURATION] [DURATION]. That's [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah, well, and then it shows [DURATION] [DURATION], so it can even be lower than that. Correct. Oh, [DURATION] [DURATION], that's what. If you could look at your specials that you got going on there. I mean, I hope it qualifies for you. That's a no brainer. Yeah. All right, well, you don't know those deals that you got going on your own cars over there or what? [PERSON_NAME]. No, be nice, [PERSON_NAME]. Be nice. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm just messing with you, bud. Yeah, I didn't know, like, I just looked it up on, on your, on the [ORGANIZATION] website. That's why I was looking. So, yeah, I'll come by and take a look. [PERSON_NAME] today? Still trying to. My kid has a game this afternoon, so might not be there. What time you guys close baseball game or what? Yeah, Yep. I got three kids, man. They're all in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Aren't those fun or what? Yeah, it's fun. Oh, it's awesome, dude. Thanks, man. I appreciate it. I'm a little louder. I'm at work right now, so I get off at [TIME] and they have a later game today. It's like a playoff for the game where we're at. So I'm gonna look it up some more. I just wanted to see about the. How the steel card thing worked on that and stuff. And I wanted to kind of look and see if they all that works out, so. And how many you have in stock right now? Can you give me that number? I think one or two. Oh, of the. Of the. Okay, sounds good. All right, buddy. I'll take a look. I'll get back to you.

"Thank you for choosing [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Hi, I'm interested in the SUVs. Can you help me with [DURATION] [DURATION] questions? Absolutely. Let me get my number one [OCCUPATION] on the phone and see if I can get you helped. Hold on. Thank you. Hello, thank you for holding. This is [PERSON_NAME] and [ORGANIZATION]. How may I help you? Hi, I have [DURATION] [DURATION] questions about your SUVs. Sure. What are they? The electric SUV for the starting price is. What is it? There's [DURATION] [DURATION] that are not on the lot yet that start just under [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Of what we have in the lot right now, I believe our lowest is like some [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Are you looking for. Are you looking for. Have you seen the picture of ours and everything or been out a lot to check it out? Yeah, I have. So I'm just confused by how. Do they come with seat warmers? Do they come with. Yes, they do. Yeah. Even the mid. Pretty much all of them have seat warmers. Technology package. They all have the full infotainment center. Some of the main things that would make one be a lower price range would be if it had cloth seats that were manual and maybe no moon roof, no panoramic roof. That's in our base model. Or it could be one of the lower price ranges because you choose the 209 mile range as opposed to the 265, 275 range. And you can get either the upgraded interior and have either range or you can get a base interior and have either range, long range or short range. And you can also do rear wheel drive or all wheel drive. So to get something like all wheel drive with the. Would you want the leatherette seats and power. Leatherette power seats and heated and cooled and everything or heated seats that you. Let's see, we have one. I believe there's one on the showroom floor. That's 51. They could be maybe 51 to 50. Now how did that jump up so high from 51 to 54? I think the one on the showroom is 51. That's not an all wheel drive. So if you're. Yes, go ahead. I thought you heard it starts at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Just under [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That would be one that is base model with the short range. They have not sent any of those out yet. Okay. Okay. So the most basic we have on the lot would be a cloth. The cloth seats that are not power and not all wheel drive, but rear wheel drive. So let me see what the lowest one I have sitting there is. Where do you. What's your first name, miss? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. So you have just been online or you haven't had a chance? And then I. I was out of town and I tried something. I'm sorry, my son's calling. Can you hold on one second? Okay, thanks. It. Hi, are you there? Yes, I am. I'm sorry. That's okay. So. Okay, so the majority of the ones, the lowest ones we have on the lot right now are [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So they. Mostly that is because they either have the cloth interior and they still have the long range battery, or they could have the short range battery and have all the leatherette seats and the panoramic roof and all that kind of stuff. So there's quite a few of them fit into the [MONEY_AMOUNT] range. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. 5 range. Then when you get out, you could even have one that is. Still has the class seats but all wheel drive. And then that would add about 2,000, a little over 2,000 when you add all wheel drive. So, yes, if it is one of our. If it's a Pro S or Pro S plus, which would just be going up on each. On each level of trim or different things like that. Do you live near [PERSON_NAME]? You know what? I don't, but I saw yours online, so. But my last car, I got [DURATION] [DURATION] away from my house, so I'm not. Oh, got it. Yeah, that's not a problem. Yeah, I understand. So we have a really large selection right now. So what things are important. Like the all. You did mention all wheel drive, right? Yeah, the all wheel drive and the moonroof and then the technology with the. All of the technology that it has. I was also looking at the Atlas crossboard. That's very, very nice. Yeah. Is that with the electric, I have to spend another [MONEY_AMOUNT] to get it installed in my house. Right. I don't know about. In your area. What it is, is you would have. Do you have a dryer plug a220 in your garage already? No, that's in my kitchen. Oh, okay. You can get it brought out to your garage with an [OCCUPATION] and that you have to get estimates from an [OCCUPATION] for. But the units go. The box that you could use, depending on what level box you get, you could go, I think anywhere from 4 or [MONEY_AMOUNT] to. You could go all the way up to top of the line and have something like [MONEY_AMOUNT] for a [ORGANIZATION] electric box. But you can. There's just different levels and you can't. So I believe it would probably be [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT] would be the. The lower price and I believe some of those are very reasonable. You can look at all of them and see what the reviews are on them. But from the feedback from a few people, I've had feedback, they had, you know, a more, a lesser expensive one and had no problems or anything with it. But anyway, so yes, you would want that box because if you just plug it in, let's see, if you don't have the 220 and you plug it into the wall, it takes a very long, very long time to charge. But we also have [DURATION] [DURATION] of free charging when you purchase it, when you purchase a new ID4 at any [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] charging stations and those are usually at the [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION], that kind of thing. Like medical buildings, that kind of thing. And there's starting to be more and more of those everywhere. Okay, and how long do you have to leave it there? It takes [DURATION] [DURATION]. You do as many times a day as you want, [DURATION] [DURATION] at a time. So [DURATION] [DURATION] would get you from about 10 to 80%. And usually if you go, let's see, 80%, usually for the life of the battery, they ask you to, or not ask you, they suggest that you keep it between 10 and 80, like 80 at the highest. Unless you're going to go on a long trip or you do commute really far every day, then you can move it up to 100%. But for the life of the battery they suggest you keep it between 10 and 80. And that takes about [DURATION] [DURATION] to charge. And so you wouldn't leave it. I wouldn't leave it overnight charging. At my house you can. Oh no. At your house you can. Okay. Yeah, you. When I mentioned the Cross. The Cross Sport. Yeah, the Cross Sport. That has quite a range, huh? Go ahead. You said that's a really nice. That's a really nice car. Do you like that one more than the electrical? Physically I do like it better physically. The look and everything. The interior space has more space, interior. And then for one is gas, one's electric and I still prefer gas. So I prefer that one. But you know, you can. We have both right now. And the Cross Sport is very nice looking. It has quite a range. Also you can be depending on whether you had a [MONEY_AMOUNT] cylinder turbo or if you had a V6, your price range goes. I would be looking at the [MONEY_AMOUNT] cylinder with the turbo. Right. So I have some of those between I believe [MONEY_AMOUNT] and [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT]. At the [MONEY_AMOUNT] you could get would be the, you know, a little bit upper, the all wheel drive. Would be technology. You can. So on the Atlas, the Cross Sport, you also can get front wheel drive or all wheel drive. So you have that option and then they don't. The Atlas doesn't come. None of them come with little technology. They all still have quite upgraded technology on the ID4 and the cross Sport. So the Cross Sport, if it had all wheel drive, the full technology package, how much is that? You might be talking maybe around [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. All wheel drive, probably [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And that gets how much mileage? The mileage on the Atlas is. It is on the highway. Let's see here. 22, I think. Let me see here. Atlas. The fourth place is 20, 23 average 25 highway, 21 city. Yeah. How. What do you do you commute in your vehicle or city? And what are you driving now, [PERSON_NAME]? Okay. Oh, okay. So I'm just looking at it. Let's see. Yes. So [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm trying to see what the range is that we have available and on leases. Because I'm looking to lease. Do folks actually hold their equity? Like there usually an equity. Is there a what, a fee? No, no. Like I usually have equity on my card when I trade my. Yeah, recently there has been. Most of the time there's been equity. I think almost everything that I've seen recently is equity. With your residual being set by the bank, you never go below, but you can. Your car can be worth more at the end and. And you can use that as equity. Okay. So there's usually equity in it. And I don't know what is the residual? It depends. Every vehicle is VIN specific on the residual, so some could. It depends. The bank sets what they believe or [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and same with probably [ORGANIZATION] and everything. They decide, oh, at the end of your lease, they believe this is how much your car's going to be worth and that price is set. If it's worth less than that, you're not responsible for that. If it's worth more than that, you could use that equity towards another vehicle. Okay. Does [ORGANIZATION] usually hold it like [ORGANIZATION] holds it really well? Yeah, recently in the time I've been back in the car business for [DURATION] [DURATION] they've had equity. Yeah. At the end of a lease. Yes. Okay. What's your name? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. And would you be able to come in this weekend or this coming week and see. And look to our Cross Sports and our ID fours. We have a really good selection right now. A lot of dealerships don't have a real deal selection, so that's what I've noticed. It's nice that you do. Yeah, we do have large selection, so that's nice because I've been hearing like, oh, you can get this. We just don't have it. Oh, okay. So see, I'm not going to be able to make it in for a little bit. And I'm just starting to look because I like to start to look ahead [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ahead. Right. To see what I'm going to get. So I still have [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], but I'd like to do my homework and figure out. Yeah, I get it. I get it. All right. So [PERSON_NAME], can you, if you would give me your email, I can send you a link to some of our inventory. Okay. All right. I can send you some information there on our inventory. And my name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'll send my information in there and you can give me a call back. And I'm happy to help with you anything in the future. And when you can make it down here, we usually have a really large supply. We have two different stores we can pull from, too. So if we don't have something, but recently we have pretty much everything. Okay. Thanks, [PERSON_NAME]. Thanks so much for your time. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. All right. Have a good day.

We're just, we're looking for some ideas on a camper. Okay. So what I'm looking for is a good four season one that's going to be nice and warm in the wintertime. Probably a bumper pole. I don't want a fifth wheel somewhere. Probably 20, 26ft somewhere around there. I'm just curious really. The big thing is like what brands are going to be the best four season winter campers for keeping it warm. Cougars are our warmest as far as having the best insulation and the heated holding tanks. And then they have the heat pads on the tanks. That would be one of the better ones. Okay, Is that your only four season of the camper or the Cougar brand? No, the grand design imagines are the Springdales. If you get one with a slide out, they got a heated enclosed underbelly and there was excellent insulation underneath there. Okay. Okay. Are you familiar with those? No, I'm not really familiar with any of them. And then the Confluence is another brand we carry that we got a hand in designing those. And so they're fully enclosed heated underbelly and heated pads on the tanks. Okay. Okay. So there's, you know, they're all 2 inch sidewalls basically. So some of these companies start throwing these R values around, but their sidewalls are the same size, same thickness as everybody else's, you know. Gotcha. Yeah. What I mean, like, do any of them have like a really like a interior temperature that's better? I mean obviously they got R values and stuff but like do any of them claim or not claim, but from, you know, people's experience have higher interior internal temperature that they're able to Maintain? Well, both Cougar and [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] imagines, they put them in these chambers that have. They set the temperature to like, below zero, and then they keep an internal temperature that stays, you know, right around 70. So they do. They do [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] on them. Gotcha, Gotcha. Okay. Do you live around here? I live in [LOCATION]. Okay, you have. Do you have those in stock? Either the Cougar or the Imagine, Whatever you said. Yeah, we do. Okay. And we got the Confluence in stock too. You plan on coming down? Yeah, at some point. I'm just trying to get some initial information right now, to be honest. So Cougar Confluent and Imagine. And I can tell you whenever I have, you know, I do a lot of hunting and stuff, and one of my. If ever one of my buddies wants to buy one, I'm gonna sell him a Cougar. Really? Yeah.

Why can we not access the. Was that listed on there? I'm just curious. Okay, so let me get it pulled up for you real quick. What happened? I'm looking for that info. What's your name, sir? Sorry, My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Got you. And last name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Got you, Mr. [PERSON_NAME]. And just a good phone contact number. I can read [PHONE_NUMBER].

I'm just looking around right now. So I'll hold off on that for now. Hey, that's. That's fair. Let me pull up. There's the window sticker right there. What options are you looking for? Let me know what options available, sir. Because the last I remember they're supposed to come was kind of fully loaded already with gps, four wheel drive, power windows, power locks, what else? I know I remember some of them were not. The lining on the truck on the back is not included. It's supposed to have already a tow package from what I remember. And that's pretty much all I remember. I don't know what else comes with it when you buy it brand new. So this. So it does have the 5 3. It is a cloth seating, heated seats in the front. It does show to have the towing package on as well. As long. As long as wireless charging. Hold on here real quick. Mr. [PERSON_NAME], I'm back. Sir, I apologize. No, no worries. Yes, sir. Has [ORGANIZATION] Wrangler tires on it, which is good. And it does have the GPS heated steering wheel as well. And I do believe it has [DURATION] [DURATION] other safety options on it as well. Okay. Yes, sir. Okay. And that's the [DATE_INTERVAL]. I'm sorry, go ahead. Yes, sir. Well, no, as far as the spray. I was going to say as far as the spray and bed liner goes, I would have to go out there and put My hands on the truck just to verify that it has that. Yes, sir. Okay. I'm flipping through the pictures. It does have a spray in bed liner. I'll be down. So it's [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. It's already ready. Okay. And [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], that's your, your listed price? Yes, sir. Okay, so we're taking. So we're taking, you know, MSRPs for [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You know, I guess we're taking right around [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] off, you know, so. Yes, sir. The only thing that's kind of. That lets me down to the other cash mileage. But what now? The gas mileage showing [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Let me double check the sticker. Yes, sir. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. But again, that is all dependent on how you drive. Yeah, that's true. Yes, sir. Well, wouldn't be a good time for you to come by and check out the truck. It's gonna be a bit. I live, I live over here in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. I live [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] away from you guys. Oh, so you're just a hop, skip and a jump from us. Yeah, yeah. We definitely have to be on a week, you know, so. But like on a Saturday. What's that? Go ahead. I'm sorry. I said for me it'd be a Saturday. But you said you are and then I cut you off. I'm sorry. You're fine. We're open Saturday from [TIME] to [TIME] to [TIME]. I'm sorry, [TIME] to [TIME] yes, sir. Oh, wow. Okay. Yes, sir. Yes. Okay. The. My thing is the. Like I said, I'm looking right now. I'm not going to buy right now, but I'm looking because I've got a [ORGANIZATION] F150 truck. But I'm not going to be trading it in because I'm selling it to family. But I'm looking for truck because he's going to be moving down here in [DATE_INTERVAL]. So probably [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] would be when I'd be looking for one or. Yeah, [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay, let's see here. Let me see a question. This is a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Do you guys have any [DATE_INTERVAL] models that are brand new that you didn't sell? No, sir. We are completely sold out on 22 silver graduates. Wow. Okay. Where they be trail bosses or anything? Okay. Yes. Yeah. Okay. On the [DATE_INTERVAL], what other colors do you have available? This one is. Let me see what colors? We have this, we have a black and then we also have a dark ash as well. And the dark ash has A six cylinder Duramax diesel engine in it. Oh, it's a diesel. Oh, but it's a six. And those do get really good gas mileage. I drive one myself and I get roughly 30 miles to the gallon on the highway going home every night. And that's a V8 or a V6. It's a six cylinder. Okay. Okay. Kind of had my. I got. I kind of got used to a V8 with my truck, with my [ORGANIZATION]. But eventually I want to buy a. I'm looking also to buy an RV that I want to go, that I can tow for sure. And that's why. Yeah, that's why I wanted a V8. Because that was one thing I did not take into account when I bought my truck [DURATION] back. Right. And I will say, you know, I have first personally had a 5.3 and towed from, you know, this, that and the other. And the gas mileage isn't quite the best. You know, just when you're towing, you know that that diesel does have enough torque on it that, well, that, you know, you won't see as much of a drop in your gas mileage. Are you talking about V6 diesel? Yes, sir. Oh, wow. I'll be done. Thank you, sir. And what kind of a price would I be looking at for that V6 diesel? Let me look. It should be right around the same price. Okay. This. Yeah, this is it right here. So this one actually MSRP is for [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Selling it for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right. Does it show what the towing capacity would be on that truck? Let's see. Because I know. Go ahead. I'm sorry, you should. No, you're fine. You should be able to be getting around 8,9000 miles. Yes, sir. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Because I'm. I'm looking to buy like a 23 footer as far as RV and I, I remember they had an expo here in town [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago and they were. And when I asked, they were asking me because I thought that I was in the market to buy a truck first. And he said, be sure to ask them what the towing capacity is because like I said, I forgot to ask him my truck when I bought it [DURATION] back. And I was absolutely. How much does your camper way. I'm sorry, say again? How much does your camper weigh? The, the 23 footer, I believe he said he had mentioned something about empty and loaded, meaning with the water. Because it gets a lot heavier with the water. Right. I think he said somewhere, you know, you have five or Six thousand pounds. Oh, well then you're fine. Yeah. All right. You're more than fine. Okay. And once again, this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] right where you're at. This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, sir. You called the right place. All right. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what, I'll save the number. Okay. And there's absolutely no chance of you coming down to look this Saturday? Oh, no, no, definitely not. I've already gotten committed to Saturday to do something else. I've got a triathlon I got to do this weekend that I already paid for. I got you that. Yeah, but I'll keep the number because like I said, I am looking, but I'm not looking to buy like right now. Right now I'm selling might be care in about what are we [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], in [DATE_INTERVAL]. And that's why I'm seriously looking to buy maybe in [DATE_INTERVAL] or [DATE_INTERVAL] at the latest. Okay. And that would be time to look around a little bit. So. But yeah, if I have any other questions, I will definitely call you back. Yes, sir. Again, my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Let me. I know you have this contact info here, but let me give you my direct line. That way you can reach me directly. Hang on, let me write this down because I'm on my cell phone right now. Pen. Your name was [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, sir. Okay, go ahead, sir. All right, so my. My cell phone is area code [PHONE_NUMBER]. You said [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER], right. Okay, got it. [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And that's going to be [PERSON_NAME]. And that's. What's the name of the business again? [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okey dokey. I will save it to my phone and I will be maybe stay in contact with you soon. And if not, then I'll call you when I get something but. And we'll see what we have then. Sounds good, sir. And I'll touch base with you between now and then, you know, just what kind of questions you might get brought up. Okay, sounds good, sir. Yes, sir. It was great talking with you, sir. Same here. Take care. Yes, sir. Bye.",failure,feature_question,Silverado 1500 LT Trail Boss,medium,False,0a4a77950d164231887405a2b8d8ecea_transcript.json
"Thank you. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. This [PERSON_NAME] speaker. Oh, yes, sir. Could. Are you busy at the moment? No, ma' am. Could you tell me the difference in the XT4 Sport on the [DATE_INTERVAL] versus the [ORGANIZATION] XT5? Is it a smaller vehicle? Slightly. What's your name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Give me [DATE_INTERVAL]. Thank you for calling. This is [PERSON_NAME], [ORGANIZATION]. How may I help you? I'm trying to find out what the difference is or is there a difference in the size of the [ORGANIZATION] XT4 Sport versus the XT5 Luxury? Premium Luxury. You want to know the difference between the two? Yes. Besides the price, obviously. Okay, let me pull up some options. Were you interested in new? Whatever you have. Okay. You said XT4, XT5, but I'm very particular about color, so you. I don't think we better go with the used. Go with the new. Wow. They look just alike. Let me see it. Hey, ma' am, I'm back. So the difference between the x t4 and x t5 is just the size. They have the same feature, but the X T5 is just a little bit bigger than the X T4. And that's all? Yes, ma' am, that's all. The difference. That's all. Why is the. What's the difference in the pricing? Let me see. You say you prefer used. Well, let's just go with the new, because I don't know anything about what you got there. Let's go with new. I can tell more about that than I can [DATE_INTERVAL] that's got a den or whatever. A new [DATE_INTERVAL] XT4 is around [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Let me find that new XT5. Ma' am. Yes, ma' am, I'm here. I'm looking for a new XP5 price. I'm. I'm really. I want to know the difference in the two. If you put them side by side, not the amount of money. I'm sure that the. The Sport costs more, doesn't it? Yes, ma' am. The difference between the two is just the size. The XT5 is bigger. It's just the size. And that's it. Period? Yes, ma' am, that's. Hold on a minute. Okay. Hey. The only difference is the size. All right. My [MARITAL_STATUS] wants to know, does the four have a four cylinder engine in it? Yes, ma' am. They can have [DATE_INTERVAL] in there. They can have [DATE_INTERVAL] in there. Yeah, but I'm checking for you now. Just a second. Turbocharged gas must be automatic. Let me get you over to a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Just a second. They'll tell you More about the engine. Okay. Okay. She's getting a man, I think, on there. That'll tell you about the engine. I really don't think it's going to be what I want, though. Hey, this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, there. Hey, [PERSON_NAME]. My [MARITAL_STATUS] said. Hey, [PERSON_NAME]. Hey. How are you? I'm all right. You're doing good today. Yes, sir, I am. It's my [PERSON_AGE] birthday. Well, happy birthday. Whoa. Congratulations on being [PERSON_AGE]. Thank you very much. How long you been [MARITAL_STATUS]? [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. We got [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] on you. Yeah. Like. Like [DURATION] [DURATION] of [MARITAL_STATUS]. Yes, but like my mom said, it's not a contest. It's the quality of time, not the quantity. Oh, your mom is very wise. She was. Is your mom and dad both living? Yeah. No, my. My mom passed in [DATE_INTERVAL]. My dad was in [DATE_INTERVAL]. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, no worries. No worries. Anyhow, so I was supposed to get y' all some numbers, right? And I didn't do that. No. I asked her what was the difference in the size of the XT4 versus the XT5, was all I wanted to know. Well, how can I just tell you that over the phone? I mean, it's smaller, but it's kind of. You know, I can give you cubic feet if that helps and all. No, that won't help me. My brain won't comprehend that. Well, here's what I was going to suggest is, without buying anything and agreeing to purchase, could y' all just come and talk with me and I'll show you the XT5, I'll show you the XT4, and I'll be the. The [DATE_INTERVAL] that knows more about them than anybody you run into, because I've been doing. Well, let me ask you this. If I ask you to order me XT5, premium luxury, huh? Can you do that? Absolutely. How much would it cost me? I want the silver. Yeah, it would just. You would just. Well, it would depend on what you want on it. But. But that's something we need to sit in front of each other and let me do it on my computer, and then we can talk about each feature as it comes up, whether you feel like you want it or not. And then when we get all I want, I'm not telling you I'm going to order it. I just wanted to know if that's a way that I can find out how much it is. And, yes, I might be interested in ordering [DATE_INTERVAL], depending on how much it is. Mm. Well, to order it, all we ask is you put a Deposit on it to hold it, you know, how much. How much is that usually? $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. We agree on price and all that, you know, and if. If somewhere down the road you decide, well, I just can't buy this car, we will. We will give you your money back. We're not trying to keep anybody's money from not, you know, that doesn't buy the car. We just don't want to do orders for people that don't have any skin in the game. Otherwise, every. Every [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], and [PERSON_NAME] would. Would put an order in for a vehicle because. Oh, sounds good today, but, you know, the commitment level is a little higher when you got to put $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down. Well, I don't think in all the [DURATION] [DURATION] we've been [MARITAL_STATUS] that have we ever ordered a car. Honey, we usually found it. I ordered the truck. You did? Okay. He's the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. He doesn't have but two. I don't know why he needs two. Or do you have three? No, I got. You just got two. You got rid of [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Oh, can we do it over the telephone? Well, you want your money, though? Well, no, it's not. It's what. What I think we ought to do is not do it over the telephone. And the reason why is because unless you see this vehicle and drive it and know the difference, because, you know, you may be happy with an XT4, but then again, you know, the XT5 will probably be the route you go. If I had to guess, do you have an XT5 on the lot? I have multiple of them and. Oh, you do? Multiple XT4s? Yes, ma' am. Do you have XT5 Premium Luxury? No, actually, I have a Sport. I do have a premium luxury as well, but I have a Sport, so. Yes, so I have. And, you know, general size questions. I just feel like it would be in your best interest if this is the type vehicle that you want, you know, the five or the four, I think you are exactly on target. Yes. Because to try and order something over the phone, like a car, I mean, if we were talking about shower curtains or bedspreads or something, you know, it's not a big deal. But a car, there's a little more moving parts, and y' all aren't that far away. You know, just time it where you come down here and come see me and then go out to eat and then go back home, you know, just make an afternoon of it. I don't want or need all your time. I just need, you know, [DURATION] [DURATION]. And we can go over the XT5, the XT4, and you may quickly look at the 4 and go, that's just not enough. You know, that's not me. And that'll quickly disqualify that and then it'll be okay. And I don't know that's the case, but I'm just speculating. But then it would be, you know, driving the XT5 and talking about some feature differences and then if you knew what you want after me showing you the car that has all these things and demonstrating how they work and what they do, then sitting in front of me and order [DATE_INTERVAL] would make a lot more sense. Because then you would be able to say, okay, that's the thing you showed me instead of me trying to explain everything to you, like the rear camera mirror versus the backup camera and sideline zone alert, or, you know, the forward collision alert, that kind of stuff. Okay. Mr. [PERSON_NAME]? Mr. [PERSON_NAME]? Oh, Mr. [PERSON_NAME], I'm [PERSON_NAME]. So I thought you were, you were messing up my name. That's what I call him when I'm trying to get his attention. Right. Did you get everything he was saying? Yeah. Do you think we can go down and let me drive it or is that too far for you to go? No, we can make it. Or would you want to go to [LOCATION]? It's not any closer to [LOCATION]. That's our two options. Well, I promise you a good experience here, so you don't have to, you don't have to buy anything, you know, anything like that. Just, just come let me do my thing. And that's show you the vehicle. And we have lots of them here. You know, this is a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] facility with $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] in inventory on the ground. So I've got probably 6 or 7 XT5s and 4 to 7 XT4s. Well, I'm going to tell you, if you don't have a gray or not gray, a silver and an XT5, I'm not going to come because I want a silver car. Okay, so you're wanting to come to buy it, not not to see it or learn. I would, I would feel better if I was going somewhere where they had [DATE_INTERVAL]. Like, like I won't or I think I would want, but I have not the other day where I told you I have a silver [DATE_INTERVAL]. I'm sorry. What? I said I'm sorry. We talked the other day and I have a silver [DATE_INTERVAL]. I'm gonna, I'm gonna pull up here, hang On I'm trying to, trying to pull up our. But yeah, I have a silver [DATE_INTERVAL] and I was telling you all about it and it's got the serious titanium interior, which is a light colored interior. And then we talked about a [DATE_INTERVAL] that I have that's silver or gray rather, that has the black interior. And you didn't want that? No, I don't even want to put a foot in it. So how much is the [DATE_INTERVAL], the first [DATE_INTERVAL] you mentioned, the [DATE_INTERVAL] that is brand new, that's a [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is a, is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. What would it take to drive it out the door exactly? I don't know, but probably [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Are you trading? You're not going to trade anything. You got a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] that GS LS 460 that we can. Or is it GS 460 sitting? And I, I can picture the car. I just don't remember if it's LS or GS. But anyway. LS okay. So you got [OCCUPATION] fee, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You got tax on [MONEY_AMOUNT] and your, your [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. So is your tax 7%, [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] or do you know, I thought it was more like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It could be [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. So every thousand or $[MONEY_AMOUNT] is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So [MONEY_AMOUNT] is almost [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So [MONEY_AMOUNT] times [MONEY_AMOUNT], that's like [MONEY_AMOUNT] in tax. So you got a [OCCUPATION] fee of [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] in tax and then the vehicle is going to have some ads on it of probably [MONEY_AMOUNT], maybe $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So we're talking $[MONEY_AMOUNT] on top of the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But did you know that [ORGANIZATION] is going to quit building gas powered engines? So this year, next [DURATION] [DURATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] might be gas, might not, but they're supposed to be done with building gas engines at that time. So it's actually going to make these last few that they sell hold their value really well. And I've been doing this long enough to know that that's true. And the, the [ORGANIZATION] products, we used to have those. And you know what made their value skyrocket is when, when [ORGANIZATION] went out of business. Yep. I know it sounds crazy, but everybody wanted them then and because they were unique, nostalgic, you know, vehicles and all. And so it's hard to believe, but we're coming into an era where electric is going to take over a lot, not all of it because they don't have enough infrastructure and Everything to make it work like they want to right now. But it's going to take over quite a bit of the market for automobiles. And it's kind of crazy and it's hard for me to wrap my mind around it. I know it's probably even harder for somebody that's older than I am, but yeah, I'd be scared that day to buy [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yeah, well, I'm right there with you. But I already sold the first [ORGANIZATION] electric vehicle in [LOCATION] and it was [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And it's called a Lyric and it looks a lot like a XT5. I've heard of it. It's got a 306 mile range. When you get a 50amp breaker in your garage and you put this charging unit in it and instead of going to gas stations, you just plug that thing in and go out and leave in it and you know, you got to ask yourself as a driver, how often do you even drive a hundred miles, much less 2 or 300? With us. With us, I am, I am hardly even putting any mileage on my vehicle. So, I mean, it will work for a lot of people. It's just, I'm just not a electric car person myself. It's just not my cup of tea. Well, all I've ever known are the gas. So it's hard to change old people. You know, we get set in our ways. Oh yeah, no, I understand. And that's, that's why it's hard for me to wrap my mind around. But, but, but that's what's gonna happen because I've seen it. You know, this place here, they put these expensive charging units in and they bought this service equipment, different lifts, you know, to be able to deal with the battery packs and all. And they've been giving us training for over [DURATION] [DURATION] on how they operate. And if the [OCCUPATION] not willing to spend the extra to sell the electric vehicles, they're going out of business. Absolutely. Because [ORGANIZATION], I think it was [DURATION] [DURATION] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] ago, gave the [OCCUPATION] an option. We'll buy you out or you get on board. And if you get on board, then it's going to be [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] in stuff you got to upfit your dealership with so you're able to retail this type of a product. So that's what happened. Because I knew a lot of them are not [OCCUPATION] anymore. Right, right. Because yeah, if you're a small town [ORGANIZATION] store, you can't afford that and you don't Know what the future holds in that. And it would be hard to do it if you could afford it mentally because it's like, man, is this going to work or what? But our company, we have, it's [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and we have 100 stores nationwide. So they. Money is not a problem. Yeah, well, we have a small deal [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] they've had such a hit with not being able to have any inventory until. For so long and they just almost look like they're out of business. Right, right. And we did for a while there too with all the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] and then the supply chain issues and the microchip problems. But now our lot's full. We got a. We got a bunch. Okay. Do you have a gray XT5 on your lot? I do not. A gray. A silver. I have a. It's called, it's called a gray. It's not a silver. And I'm going to look and if they even make a silver [ORGANIZATION]. Hang on, bear with me [DATE_INTERVAL] second here. Okay, now, brand new, I've got the website showing two, but I thought there was more than that. But maybe the ones I'm seeing are pre owned. But I got [DATE_INTERVAL] that's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. But neither [DATE_INTERVAL] of these are silver, so. But I had. Yeah, I think I sent y' all pictures of it. Right. Let me, let me look up your phone number. Your phone number. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Let me see here. Yeah, [PHONE_NUMBER]. And what's the name of the company you're with? It's [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, I've got it pulled up right here. Yeah, well, I have a family that's buying a car that just walked in here and. Do you need to go with them? We're not doing anything. You go ahead. You go ahead and take care of that. Okay, but let's talk again tomorrow. Okay. I thought I had a brand new [MONEY_AMOUNT] out there that was silver, but my website showing two new ones. But anyway, I sent a picture of [DATE_INTERVAL] of Yalls phone numbers. Is this the home line? And you had a mobile phone. Don't send it to this. It's the [PHONE_NUMBER] number that you need to send it and shoot. Let me know about the new ones you got on your lot. I think we'll make a trip down there and let me drive [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yes, okay. That would be a good. We'll talk later. Thank you all. Thank you so much. Okay, bye. See you later.

"Thank you. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Hey, good morning, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm calling from [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. we are in search of a ramp 5500 with a service body. And I see. Saw that you guys had one on your website. We do have one. I'm sorry. I think. Yeah, we have one. Yeah. So I just want to see like, you know, what the final pricing comes out to and I guess how we can make, you know, make the purchase happen from here. We'll come up to pick up the truck, but the person coming to pick up the truck won't be the person, you know, won't be the. Our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] who will be signing for it. Right. We could do it remotely on how it works. Yeah, we can, we can send you some. We can basically overnight the paperwork and then you send it back to us and then it's ready to pick up. Okay, so the MSRP on that truck is [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's not including the outfit. The outfit adds [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Total price on [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] minus any rebates that you guys will qualify for. Gosh, if you have any rebates right now, I can check here for you real quick. What's, what's your guys zip code? You still there? Yeah, I'm here. Did you ask me question? What's your zip code? Oh, [LOCATION]. It doesn't look like there's any active rebates on it, so. Oh, really? The [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus tax title, which is. Or plus title and doc fees which are [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus tax. Gotcha. So like there's no like other incentives or [EVENT] [EVENT] sales? What's that? I'm sorry, There is no other incentives or [EVENT] [EVENT] sale? No, there's. There's not. I mean we, we can work something out for you. I mean. What. Yeah, that's our. So yeah, I mean I was hoping, you know, just because we have to also come all the way. I had one quick question. Does that truck have a lift gate on. Does not. It's just a regular 11 foot service body. Are you guys able to put a lift gate? Because I think like just based on what our need is, we're gonna need a lift gate. I probably would not be able to put a lift gate on it. But I mean once you guys get it, you can, you have done whatever you want to. Yes, we have for the past. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. Like, you know, if you can just, you know, make A deal for me how? Like, you know, we need this truck, so we'll be happy to drive down it and get it. Okay. What. What's your name? My name is [PERSON_NAME].

I'm sorry. [LOCATION]. Okay. Would you guys be looking to finance or pay cash? I'm not. Still not 100% sure. We have some business financing available, but just depends on, you know, what the final cost comes out to and then the interest rate and all that. So could be financing or. Like I said, we have our own business financing, so we just haven't decided, I guess, which way works the best one. And if you're. If you're going to let us facilitate the financing, how much would you guys put down? I just want to be able to get. You gotcha. I would say about [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then [DURATION] [DURATION]. [DURATION] [DURATION]. You would. You would want to do the financing, preferably [DURATION] [DURATION], but if you. There's a better pricing on like, you know, [DURATION] [DURATION], then, you know, I'm happy to, but generally you try to. [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. And then your phone number is. This is my cell phone, yes. Okay. What's a good email address for you saying send you over numbers? It's my first initial P.

Yeah, he'll be back in tomorrow at [TIME], so I will get with him, but I just wanted to print out your information since he's not here.

So where'd you go? [LOCATION]. You live? Yep. Forever and ever. I hope so. We're just giving it. We're giving it the good old college try right now and hope that it works out.

Okay, so [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Yeah. The plates. Okay, Those can conveniently go in the garbage if you want, but. Well, no, they have to go. Are they [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? Yes. You and I have a little confrontation. Maybe I'm losing you now. Renew them. Well, then maybe we can tuck them in the back pocket and see what happens. Okay, so you're not worried about the place. You're worried about the garage door opener. That's the only one. Okay. We'll keep everything else secret. Okay. I appreciate it. You enjoy. Hey, it shouldn't be life or death, but I'm on it.

New ranges are look good. [PERSON_NAME]. I sold one, the red one Hot Pepper Red like last month. Last week of month. And it was really good too. It was a localized sale over here in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. All right, I'll send you one picture of Edger Glacier so you can see how I'm curious. Do you know what kind of tires that has on there? Like what they look Like I can tell you, I can pull it up the windows checker for you. So this is the color [PERSON_NAME]. I just send you one picture. I sold this one Raptor R. So it's like, it's kind of a blue [ORGANIZATION] gives weird name, you know, Agile gray or something. So this is a color. Let me see the windows checker. It's all right. 5ft bed, XLT 2.3 EcoBoost engine, Azure gray cloth seats and XLT. Okay. FX4, you got a offloading package in that. So you got a like the big tires on that thing. Like not a big one like standard one. You got the off roading tuned suspension and that. So you Got a like FX4 off roading package as well. So it's gonna be like you can. What does that mean? It's gonna be the standard size tires. I'll tell you exactly. Build sheet. Did you get the color of the picture? I'll just send it. Yeah, I did. And here is a windows ticker as well. So it says that it's the black appearance or something like that. What does that mean? Oh, okay. Yeah, you got a black appearance package in that. So it's like tuned like your black appearance package comes with like if you check it out, it gives you the black rims and the like the, the indicators, the side mirror, it's gonna be black cover. It looks really nice. Just google it. The black appearance package, it will tell you exactly. So will that will there people use on the F150s and like the bigger like big trucks, like 250s. So black appearance is really good. People like this package and on the back of the like how it says Ranger on the tailgate, would that be in black or is that something different? All right, so your tire one questions for you, like you asked me, it's 18 inch black. It's what? 18 inches wheel. The wheel size? Yeah, 18 inch. It's a black painted as I told you black appearance package. So we colored like black and the like black appearance. I would say it's kind of a graphics like on the side where it's written Ranger, it's going to be black. It's like the bumper cover, it's black. Like black appearances. I would say it's kind of a modification in a easy language like black tire, black wheels. And the indicator, the side mirror, it's going to be black color. And the fenders it's going to be black. And the windows colored by black. You know what I'm saying? Like they're all covered like the black Edge of black. Yeah, that's called black. Okay. And you said the wheels are what size? 18 inch. I sent you the window sticker as well written up there. Yep. Oh, okay. Do you have any on your lot that have the same wheels that this one would have that you could. No. Send me a picture of? I do not actually right now at this moment. I. I did have last week, but I sold it. The Ranger that was a trimmer. MSRP was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's the same thing. Customer order like same 20, 19. He just showed up back down on his order. So we sold it of that thing. [MONEY_AMOUNT] over MSRP just because of Rangers allocations are really limited. Yeah. Okay, so this one is pretty good. The price point. And you got the black appearance package and the off roading package as well. Now if my son was interested in this, what does it require to be able to hold it so he can see it? Yeah, for sure you can. So we don't typically. I'll be honest with you, because last time I did take a deposit from the guy for the [ORGANIZATION] Cactus gray all wheel drive, and he hold his audit for [DURATION] [DURATION]. And when the vehicle shows up here in our parking lot, he got backed out. So we are not taking any kind of deposit. If you guys are not sure that the [OCCUPATION]. You want to buy it. But yes, really something. So they want you to. They want you to commit to something that you can't drive. Yeah. Where you like. You live around here in [LOCATION]. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Then we can take it because that, that customer was out of state and we pulled something for you know what I'm saying, [PERSON_NAME]? Like for [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION]. Like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. And. Well, I know, I mean, my son. My son's interested in it, but I don't want to say that I'm gonna buy something that I can't test drive. But he's very. Exactly. Exactly. For sure. That's. That's what I'm saying. When vehicle shows up here in our parking lot, you guys come up here, test drive, make sure like it, then you buy it. But it's not something like that vehicle is here and I'm giving a call. Hey, mister, your vehicle. You're saying, oh, no, we already bought something else. We are not in the market, so. Yeah, that's not. We are taking deposit. Anything. Yes, we can. It's a refundable deposit. If you drive it, you don't like it. Yes, that's totally refundable. I'm sorry, I'm still confused. So I can put a deposit down so that you don't sell it before it gets here. Oh, yeah, of course it means we cannot sell anything. We cannot sell to anyone if we put a deposit under your name. But if I put a deposit down and once it gets here and I test drive it and I decide, yeah, it doesn't. It's not exactly what we thought. I won't get the deposit back, I'm sure. No, no, for sure you will get your deposit back if you test drive it. You. And how much is the deposit? How much is the deposit? [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes. You get back if you don't like it. It's a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit along with your license copy. Picture of your license copy. So we can put your name under Ranger, $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit. But you get it back and you test drive and decide that [DURATION]. You know, once it comes in, it is refundable. But you won't sell it to somebody in the meantime. Why it's coming to get in. Exactly. Coming in. You got it? Yep. All right. I'm just. I'm actually making the phone call for my son because he was going to come up and look at it today. We didn't realize it wasn't on your lot. Yeah. So I wanted to make sure it was there and the color said and all of that. Yeah, for sure. I'll be just. Just a second. So Windows Seeker is [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Usually market on the Rangers and [ORGANIZATION] is about to local like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] over MSRP but for the direct car loan to customer we are charging [MONEY_AMOUNT] over. So it's going to be [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Let me know. Just check it out with the window sticker and everything. This thing will be here on [DATE]. Oh, sorry. What is that? Locator. Sorry. I guess I don't understand. Why did the price go up? Because Ranger has [DURATION] [DURATION] waiting and allocations are very limited. High demand, low supply. So you put the. You can check it out at one thing. Okay. Yeah. So we are asking [MONEY_AMOUNT] over MSRP and that's the. Yeah, that's the price. And again, you don't need to put a deposit. First you do research or something and then you can put a deposit. I'm pretty sure we got some [OCCUPATION] offer five over. Like another dealership offer us five over. But we are saying we want to sell vehicle to the customer, not to [OCCUPATION]. I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. No, I'm saying average market of the Ranger it goes around in the like out of state [MONEY_AMOUNT] over in an easy end and still [MONEY_AMOUNT] over the MSRP what's listed on the stickers? Yes ma' am. And in the [LOCATION] county It's usually around [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's why we got a [OCCUPATION] offer at [MONEY_AMOUNT] over. Then they can sell up to [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] over. But we are directly doing to the consumer at [MONEY_AMOUNT] over. So I send you the window sticker. Yeah, it's gonna be [MONEY_AMOUNT] over and you got all the things. This is the color I send you just check it out with your son. No pressure. Just like you know, make sure. Just do some research and let me know when you guys ready to put a deposit. Right now I haven't get any deposit of this thing yet. Yeah, great, great. Thank you for your help. All right. Yeah, for sure. Thank you so much. Have a good [DURATION]. Bye, you too. Bye. Bye.",success,inventory_check,Ranger,medium,False,0a6c3bb682e54bce98212a8ad53c1a51_transcript.json
"Hello, this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi there. I just got a call because I just did an inquiry about wanting to sell my Lexus. Yes, of course. Is this [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. Yeah. How's it going today? It's going really well. Oh, good. So, yeah. Are you looking to sell your Lexus outright or replace it or what are you thinking? I'm just. So. I'm. I'm getting [MARITAL_STATUS] in [DATE_INTERVAL], and I'm just trying to get rid of it to be able to have more money in my pocket and able to, you know, purchase whatever we need. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, congratulations. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. Well. Yeah. Okay, so our process here is super easy. What happens is, do you have the title for it? I'm still financing it. I don't know. That's. That's all right. No, not at all. We're able. We're totally able to work with you. Who's it. Who's the loan through? It's through. So I moved out of state. I'm from [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. So the. The bank I'm with over there, it's [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, no problem. Yeah. So what would happen is, in that case, you'd still come in, we'll make an appointment, we'll do the appraisal together, and then if we're able to exceed your pay, well, we just sit down, call the bank Together, get your [DURATION] [DURATION] payoff information, and then, you know, if we get to your payoff, then we literally overnight. Overnight it to them, you're free and clear of it. If we exceed your payoff, then we cut you a check for the difference when we get the title from the bank. So it's super duper simple, and it maybe takes like, [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. In case. Let's just say whatever [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] says, and like, whatever my payoff is, if there's a difference, like what I have to pay for it, like, let's say [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Whatever you guys offer, it's lower than what my payoff is. Do I pay the difference? Yeah, that's how that would work. How much do you still owe on it? I think somewhere between, like, [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Yeah, that's not bad at all. It looks like [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] was at [MONEY_AMOUNT] anyways. So. Yeah, I don't think that we'd have it. I mean, if the condition that you put on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] was pretty accurate, then I don't think we'd have a problem at all. Okay. And I've never. I don't know if you can pull it up. But when I bought the car back in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], they never disclosed any information of it until I started doing inquiries about, like, you know, selling my car. And it says there's an accident on it. And I've never known about that. They never told me anything when I bought it back in [LOCATION]. Okay. Yeah, I'm looking at your Carfax right now. It says damage reported accident reported between [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] and [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. It says police accident reports are required in [LOCATION] when the estimated range exceeds $[MONEY_AMOUNT] to of the accident. The date of this particular accident was not reported to Carfax, but likely occurred between [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] and [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. So that's okay. No worries at all. We just. When we do our checklist, we'll just mark that it does have an accident on the Carfax. And just because we always do disclose that to our customers when we turn around and resell it. But we buy. You know, it doesn't even say that there was major damage or it's not a salvage title or anything, so it's okay. We can still work with you. Okay. Okay.

"This is [PERSON_NAME], how may I help you? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], how you doing? Good. Oh, not too bad, not too bad. Oh, just try and enjoy this beautiful day. We got. Oh, calling in. Seen you guys had a few super duties out there and looking for dually [DATE_INTERVAL]. Dually lariat. I have to take a look. 450 or 350? Yeah, diesel, gas. Diesel. I actually got a diesel right now at 450 limited. [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay. Yeah, I would have to take a look and confirm which ones are actually available. I mean, is there exactly what you saw on the website or are you just seeing what we kind of have? I'm trying to see what you guys. Both, really, I'm trying to see what you guys have and I did see a couple of them online. Yes. Okay. I'd have to take a look just to want to confirm them all with my [OCCUPATION] and stuff to see if they're sold orders or not. Is this something you want to take a look at today or next week? Oh, I would love to, but I'm all the way in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. That's where I'm from. A little ways from you guys. But I want to see if you guys got something out there today. I can come there today. I don't know what time you guys go because it's [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT], but. Oh yeah, we're only going to be here till about [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] today. Yeah, if you got a truck there, we'll figure something. Okay, well, can I get a first name, last name, phone number? Yeah. Let me ask you a question. Is there any way you can connect me to the [OCCUPATION], somebody that knows more about these vehicles? I have to take a look. As of right now, I'm pretty low on staff. To be honest with you. We kind of a little busy with walk ins and everything. I only have one [OCCUPATION] here today and one [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] here today. I'm just going to go with him. Can you connect me with him real fast? Maybe he knows more, what's available, what's there. Yep. I mean I was just gonna get with him in [DURATION] [DURATION]. I mean, I'll still work with you and stuff. I just want to find. Yeah, I know, of course. Yep. Let me spend a transfer. Yeah, thanks man, I appreciate it. What was your name again? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. All right, let me see real quick. [OCCUPATION] and [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. And it's why we honor competing [OCCUPATION] service coupons and offer you a free loaner vehicle when your vehicle's here for a collision repair. Not to mention it's how can I help you? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], how you doing? Good, how are you? Good. Are you one of the [OCCUPATION] there or what? Yeah. Oh, good. I thought maybe [NATIONALITY] or something or maybe they connected me to the wrong deal. Oh, we'll just talk with a [PERSON_NAME], another guy or whatever. I forgot his name already. Oh, and connect me over to you. I was interested in a super duty. I'm looking for 350 or 450dually lariat and calling in to see what you guys have. And I did see one [DURATION] [DURATION] of them online, so giving you a call. We have one here, but the customer is coming. It was a special order for the customer. They're coming to pick it up next week. If that one were to fall through, what's a good number for you and give you a call? Okay, what one is that one? Is the white one or the red? Yeah, right now the red one. The white one is already sold. All right. Yeah, I'm more interested in. I mean, I'll take the white one too, but more interested in the red. Okay, yeah. As soon as I find out with this customer who ordered it, I will reach out to you. Okay. Yeah, anybody you can ask right now to see or something. I don't know. No, there. I'm the new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. They're supposed to be coming in next week to take delivery of it from [LOCATION]. So. Yeah, follow me back. Why would you want to order a truck from all the way from [LOCATION]? That makes no sense at all. Because we were willing to take the order. They ordered three of them. Seems like to me there was better off order than [LOCATION]. But for some stupid odd reason, when people from [LOCATION] order trucks, they're coming in like left and right, very fast, faster than anybody else. I don't know why. I guess because it's truck world over there and they know they're gonna sell it. So [ORGANIZATION] is shipping them out faster there. For some reason they got more stock. [LOCATION] has got more stock than [LOCATION] or any anywheres in between. [LOCATION], [LOCATION], [LOCATION], [LOCATION], all that. Oh, and what I don't understand is how come we can't get the trucks fast when we live in [LOCATION] and they build them right around the corner. That's what I don't. Yeah, I'm not real sure on that, but as soon as I find out. No, I know why. Okay, you want me tell you why? This might make perfect sense. You guys don't sell a lot of super duties in [LOCATION]. That's why. Mostly. Mostly F150. That's what you guys sell. I know what you guys sell already. Everybody wants that F150 job. But yeah, that truck comes available, which is. I have a strong feeling that they're not going to buy that truck. Not going to come from [LOCATION] to buy that truck. One of my friends just now ordered a truck. The same identical truck like you got there right now. And guess how long it took him to get it? About [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. He got it and he's in [LOCATION]. Oh, yeah. But yeah, comes available, I will give you a call. Yeah, becomes available, give me a shout. I do have a trade in as well. So I got a F450 Limited [DATE_INTERVAL]. Oh, cool. Yeah, Yep, That. That would definitely work for us, too. So as soon as I find out, I'll give you a call. It'll probably work better. I'm also local. I'm not out of. I'm not out of state, and I got a trade in here. So that would probably be worth better for me to do business with you guys than that guy from [LOCATION]. Let's put it that way. Yeah. Okay. So comes available, we think maybe you can call me Monday or Tuesday or your private clothes on Tuesday. Monday, right. We certainly are. Yeah. I will call you as soon as I know, though. Give me a call as soon as you find out. All right. My name is [PERSON_NAME], by the way. Okay. All right, thank you, my friend. Your name was. One more time. [PERSON_NAME]. Right, [PERSON_NAME].

"Your call is very important to us. Please continue to hold for the next available [OCCUPATION]. Thank you. Yes, hi, is this [PERSON_NAME]? No, she's actually away from her desk at the moment. Was there anything I can help you with? Okay, yeah, because I'm calling about [ORGANIZATION] that you have for sale. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] X3X drive 30i. Okay, I can help you. Give me one second, let me just pull up your information. Sure. What is your name? [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, yes, yes. Is this [PERSON_NAME]? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, because to see a call, left a message. I called back, but I left the voicemail on her machine, her extension. But also I called this [PERSON_NAME]. But, but anyway, if you can help me to find. Yeah, so I was looking at this [ORGANIZATION] X4 3X drive 30. I. I believe you have it on the market for [MONEY_AMOUNT], correct? Yes, this one is still here and available. Okay, where is it that you would be coming from? Well, I, I live in [LOCATION], you know, [LOCATION] [LOCATION], roughly about [DURATION] [DURATION] from you guys. Do you have a vehicle to trade in? Yes, I have a [ORGANIZATION] Wrangler Sahara. I put it on the website. You know, on your Website It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] that 100,000 miles and you guys give me a trade in value of [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] on this traded. Okay. Do you see that? Yes, I do see that appraisal. So we just need to take a look at it, just thoroughly appraise it and then we can go over your options. Were you planning on trading that in or just selling it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, we were planning on trading that in. You know, it's, you know, it's, it's, you know, you're going to give me that trade in value, you know, but you said you're going to look at it, so. Yeah, they have to look at it. Yes, from the value. Right, of course, yeah, but, but, yeah, but you know, I'm assuming that that's what it's going to be because, you know, there's really nothing, there's nothing wrong with the car. You know, everything should be fine. Okay. Okay, so now I understand. Like, I mean some [OCCUPATION] give like a military discount, you know, especially now with [EVENT] [EVENT] coming and whatnot. Do you guys do that? So for new cars there is military offers, but not so much for pre owned vehicles. Okay. That doesn't really apply to used cars. Process. I see. Okay. All right. And then is there any kind of guarantee on the car? This vehicle is a select vehicle. So with us Just from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] there is a [DURATION] [DURATION] or 3,000 mile powertrain and transmission warranty. Okay, [DURATION] [DURATION]. The third or 30,000 miles. Yeah, [DURATION] [DURATION] or 3,000 miles, whichever comes first. I. I see. Oh, 21. Okay. All right. Okay. And as far as any kind of wiggle room. Can you come down a little bit on that price? As far as price? This is the best selling price that I'm able to give you over the phone and through the Internet. Once you hear the [OCCUPATION] are far more receptive to giving a better deal. I mean, but they're only going to discuss that and go over that once. Customers here in house. Right. Okay. All right, so all right. And you guys, and you're available, what time you guys close? Monday through Friday from [TIME] to [TIME] and Saturday from [TIME] to [TIME]. [TIME] to [TIME] and Saturday is [TIME] to [TIME]. Okay. Monday, Friday, [TIME] to [TIME]. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. So. Okay. Yeah, I just wanted you know, know and you know, with the [OCCUPATION] with trade in and you know, so they would have to look at it. Right. And then. Yeah, and we got a 3,000 [DURATION] [DURATION] warranty on the new car. And what else? Yeah. And then obviously like if we were to bring the car down the [ORGANIZATION], right. That we thinking of trading in. Like, like is it something that we have to make an appointment for, for you to check it out or, or do they check it out while we're there or how does that work? You can, whichever [DURATION] you're available to stop in, bring the car with you that same [DURATION]. You'll obviously, you'll see our car and then we'll go over everything then. Oh, okay. So it's not like it needs to stay there for, you know. Can we drive the car? Yeah, I mean we could drive the car back. Right. I don't have to stay there. Right. Okay. All right. So we don't have to make an appointment for that. Right? We could just. We're coming anytime. Well, we do try to go by appointments just so we can cover. Confirm availability availability for the car that you're interested from our dealership. But as far as. So I mean just give us a call. You can always ask for me, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. Or, or you can ask for, for [PERSON_NAME], that was one of the other girls that was reaching out to you. Right. You can ask for one of us and then we'll arrange your appointment. Okay.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME], how can I help you? Hi. So I have a [ORGANIZATION] vehicle and then recently the engine light was on is on and I check it to my [OCCUPATION]. They perform some work but they say there's a software called ECM needs to be updated and it's only available at [ORGANIZATION] dealership. So I'm just watching, wondering that because I made an appointment tomorrow at your place, but I'm not sure like how long will it take? Will I be able to like get my vehicle before the end of the day before you close or something? May I get the phone number the account would be associated with? Yeah, it's [PHONE_NUMBER]. All righty, let me see. Sure. Okay, just [TIME] moment. Let me see if I can get you with a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] to let you know how long that's going to take. Okay? Okay, sure. That would be great. Thank you. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Thank you for holding. Hi, so I just called a [OCCUPATION]. Did she tell you anything? Yes, she did. She told me you have an appointment set for tomorrow, but then she said you had a question about something. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So I recently my engine light was on like since last week and then I took it to the [TIME] of my [OCCUPATION] and they perform some work but they say on the next step is to update whatever the ECM software and retest it. But they say it's only available at [ORGANIZATION] dealership. So I'm wondering that how long will the process take? Like approximately. Because I'm thinking if I'm able to get the vehicle before you close. You close like [TIME], right? Correct? Yeah. How do you think if you get it to me today before we close, I could probably have it done for you by the end of the day tomorrow. Usually the ECM is like an iOS update. The easiest way to explain it to people. Sometimes the iOS updates take [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], sometimes they take [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Oh, I see. So if I drop my vehicle today like around [TIME] and you say I'll be able to check it tomorrow before you close? Correct. Okay then. But I like I'm not able to make an appointment like on the website for today. So the. Yeah, because we don't do same day appointments then and like. So is it okay if I just drop my vehicle there today at [TIME]? Yeah, drop it off and we'll try to work in it. If not it'll be, it'll get pulled in tomorrow. Okay, that sounds good. Then I'll be there. Should I provide any information there or should I just repeat the steps. I got everything here. I have the VIN number. You're just coming in for ACM reprogram. I'll put here that you requested it. Now, whatever issues you're trying to solve, if it doesn't take care of the problem, we are not responsible because we did not diagnose the vehicle. Okay. All right. Is there a base charge for everything they charge for reprogramming? They charge $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Giving the sober update, right? Correct? Yes, ma' am. Okay. All right. All right.

Should I go pick up the jet myself and test it on the water and see if the problem duplicates itself? I mean, you're more than welcome to do that.

That's why you don't see too many used car leases. Gotcha. Well, let's see what you got. All right, so let's go under here. New lease offers. I got a couple lease specials going on right now. I have one on a white one in stock and one on a gray coupe. The white one I have is a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Let me click on the details exactly. It's [MONEY_AMOUNT] down. So [MONEY_AMOUNT], just about [MONEY_AMOUNT] down. And it's based on 10,000 miles [DURATION] [DURATION]. It's a [DURATION] [DURATION] lease and the payment is [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus tax. Okay. I'm looking for way more. I need like at least 15. At least 15,000 [DURATION] [DURATION]. At least 15,000 miles [DURATION] [DURATION]. So yeah, we just had to, you know, we can, what we can do is if that's it would change your payment, but we can keep the structure the same and just change the term. Yeah, and I'm also looking for more like a [DURATION] [DURATION] lease because [DURATION] [DURATION] down, like about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] down the line I'm going to be looking, I'm going to be in the market for like a different car, [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah. So we can customize the lease for a shorter term and keep like the similar discounts and stuff on those particular cars. Did you want to come in and take a look at the vehicle? Not a white one, man, I want, I'm gonna want a black, black on black. Okay. Yeah, we have some black ones in stock. I'm confident if you come down, find one that works for you, we can put something together for you that might work. Okay. And if I did it through business, do I get additional, like, what's maximum you guys give me? Actually, before we even talk about that, 16,000 miles [DURATION] [DURATION] is our max mileage. Structure that they give us through [ORGANIZATION], you might be able to buy lease miles ahead of time, but if you're only doing [DURATION] [DURATION], you're going to be allotted 30,000 miles. Most people in that case would start getting rid of the vehicle around 30,000 miles, even if you're a little early on the lease term. How does that work out? How would I get rid of the knee earlier? So you're going to get a residual. Like when you walk it, walk in there and you get numbers, they're always going to have a residual that's going to be your guaranteed buyout price. So you have a couple different options at the. Whether you're in the middle of the lease or you're at the end of the lease, it's going to be. At the end of lease would be the exact residual amount. If you got out of it early, it'd be residual plus whatever payments you have left. And then you can either trade it in, buy it out, or sell it to a [OCCUPATION] or sell private parties. There's several different options you have on a lease. Okay, okay. See, that's not a lot you're familiar with when it comes to leasing a vehicle. Yeah, the easiest way is. Yeah, Easiest way is you can pull your payoff on a lease and then you ask the [OCCUPATION] how much your car is worth. And if it's more or less, you give them money to get out of it or you get money back to get out of it. I gotcha. Just like. It's just like a auto loan. Just like if you had a balance on there, what is my balance and what is my car value worth? Okay. Right. So what if, like the, like the. Between the Cayenne and the Macan? Because I've never. I've never owned a porch before. What's like that? Like how. How much bigger is the Cayenne than the Macan? Seating capacity is exactly the same. Overall, you're going to have more cubic space in the back for cargo, and then you're going to have more legroom for the passengers. How much more? I don't know the exact details. Yeah, it's a reasonable amount. You know, if you have a lot of passengers that are driving in the back with you, it's definitely more comfortable being a Cayenne. It's considered a full suv. Macan's considered like a midsize suv. So they are pretty different in size. Nothing like crazy if you're just going to be the [OCCUPATION] and passenger. But if you are going to have additional passengers in the Second row. It is something that you start noticing. Plus, if you have a lot of equipment and stuff like that makes a difference, right? Yeah. So what's the lease option on the Macon? Let's see. Let me go back to that page here. And the Macon lease special we have is. The one we have up right now is about 5,000 down, 10,000 miles [DURATION] [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION], and that's [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus tax. [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus tax. How much for 15,000? All those parameters we got to put together, these are all just advertised lease special. So we can customize the lease. We just need to find the right car you're looking at, put it all together for you, but all those things can be plugged in. Okay, we can go over all those options. You know, did you want to get, like, set appointment for the weekend? Come in, take a look at both Cayenne McCons and kind of see which one works best for you, and then we can put something together for you. Not a problem. So I'm out here in the city, [PERSON_NAME]. It's gonna be a little difficult for me to get out there within the next [DURATION] [DURATION]. We could do text, email, all us up till we go find something that works out and I come out, then I can head out over there and test [OCCUPATION], see if I like it, and go from there. All right, if that works for you. If it doesn't, then, you know, it's not a big deal. No, no, no. I'll get your information, shoot you a little link, text message, and then we'll try to find a car that works for you and then coordinate a time for you to come take a look at it and put some numbers together and go from there.

I have a lease which is going to end in [DATE_INTERVAL]. The reason I started looking at least, because I know that force have like a lot of wait time. So that's the reason I called up and wanted to check on the weight. If, if, if it's getting delivered in [DATE_INTERVAL], I'm pretty okay with it. Okay. Yeah. But beyond [DATE_INTERVAL], again, I'll be left without a car. Yeah, see, right. Let me. Give me some information. Hold on. So what's with saying that. Hold on. Oh man. Where my paperwork is. So we're saying that and I'm trying to. Hold on. Get the. Try to get some notes all Right. So. All right, well, saying that if you will wait and if you wanted to wait for something like that, yeah, I can get your name and number and I could just keep it posted on when something comes through. Right now we have to wait until the next allocation. The next allocation is not going to be until next [DURATION]. Maybe the [DATE] or [DATE] is when [ORGANIZATION] will give us our next allocation. So we'll know then what we'll be getting, but we don't know what we're getting. Okay, so can you note something? I want a RAV4SE, blue color with the weather package. Okay. What I do is I just keep you posted. Or if we get anything close to that. Like I said, it might not be just like that, but if I get something close to that, I just keep it posted. Sure, it works. Do you want me to drop by the showroom or like, you just keep me posted? Keep you posted. Because like I said, it's gonna be what. What I have. What we have to do is just wait and see if [ORGANIZATION] sent us anything close. And you said round four SE and blue. You say hybrid? Hybrid, yes. Or if you get any Venza. Hybrid levels of. Fine. Okay. Now with Avenza, I might be able to get you a Venta. I mean, let me see if I got. Let me see what I got coming. I got Venus coming available. I might have a Venza that's coming available. Do you want the LE or xle? Xle. Okay. No, I don't have an xle. Venza. Okay, sure. So what's your good name? If I want to drop by in the showroom, like, I can ask for you. You can ask for [PERSON_NAME] or you can ask for [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Oh, sure. You can think. You have my number, right? You can. You can ping me when you get the location. All right, you're looking at. Give me a good number for. Okay. Is that [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, yeah.

Okay. Okay. Just give me. Okay. All right. Okay. So I just said I keep you posted on it. Okay? That way, you know, come. Come next [DURATION], we'll figure out what we get on our allocation. Okay? Okay. And so when you say allocation, that means they are allocated to you, but they might take [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] to get to the lot. Yes, sir. Okay. Can you please give me a call next [DURATION], [PERSON_NAME]? Yeah, we'll figure out. We'll figure it out. As soon as I get started on something, I'LL let you know, all right? Sure. Thanks, man.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME], how can I help you? Thank you. Looking for [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, hold on one moment. Thanks. Thanks for holding. This is [PERSON_NAME], [ORGANIZATION]. I'm sorry I missed your name, was it? Yeah, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Just looking at your website. Looks like you had a bear with me. One second here. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [DATE_INTERVAL]. That's still on your lot. Yeah, look here, let me pull it up. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] here. Was it the. Looks like I have two max or the standard length? The. The max. The max. Okay. Okay, well, hold on. Maybe I'm here, I'm looking here. [ORGANIZATION] Exhibition Limited, Limited or XLP stock number. I guess maybe I lost [DURATION] [DURATION]. Maybe I lost it here now. Darn it. Yeah. Okay, so a [ORGANIZATION] Expedition Rate is an XLT I was looking at. That's a 12,000 on it. Was there one that had. Oh, there it is. [DATE_INTERVAL] limited expedition with 55,000 for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Now is that a max or is that a standard? Let me see. Oh, my website stopped working here. That's mine too, for some reason. Goes to. Here, let me pull them up again. Okay. All right, [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay, that's a standard link. Yep. Okay. All right. What did you have there in the Max? I guess maybe I misread one here. Okay. You prefer the max? Yeah, yeah, we need the room in the back. Okay, so we have the other [DATE_INTERVAL]. It's 57,000 miles. That's priced at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's a Limited. And then [DATE_INTERVAL] looks like two [DATE_INTERVAL] models and they're in the 60s. So the other one that's kind of comparable to the other one is at 57,000 miles for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I must have hit the wrong. Oh, that's why I like I saw it earlier when you're talking about. But I hit Expedition here. Okay, there we go. Now we're on the right page. So yeah, the one I was looking at is. That looks like stock number 211. Okay. PP2211. Yep. So that one's available. And then I guess what is the condition of it? I mean, scratch wise, any cosmetic stuff, you know, I can go out there and take a look at it. But that, that one is the, the standard length, not the, the max, is it? Okay, so I'm looking at one that says. I clicked on max. One second. Yeah, let me just, let me just. [DATE_INTERVAL], right? Yeah. And I apologize if I'm getting it wrong here. No, here. I think my computer. I'm on my. I gotta get switched to my phone mic. For some reason it's not working for me. All right. Okay. All right. So yeah, the one I said. Oh, go ahead. 2002 [VEHICLE_ID]. I'll pull up the actual sticker here. Okay. That one. Yes, that one for 40 and that's [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yep. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. Yep. Yeah. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That one's the Max. Yep, that's one. Okay. That's as rightfully done the wrongs. So yeah, this is one of the black. Black interior. Black interior exterior. Yeah. As far as condition wise, I would have to go out there and take a look at it. I can put my eyes on it and touch it. I guess another question too is do you guys have the like the internal limited lifetime warranty purchased from you guys? We have the. It's a [ORGANIZATION] certified warranty. So it's. It's not a lifetime warranty. The power trim warranty goes up to 100,000 miles for the power train. Okay. I know the one dealership, we're looking at one now and has a life limited lifetime warranty on the powertrain and engine. As long as we're the owner of the vehicle, that's what it covers. But I don't know if you guys have something like that or not. Yeah, we just have that. That [ORGANIZATION] is called gold certified. So it's 100,000 miles or [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. And then limited bumper to bumpers [DURATION] [DURATION] and 12,000. Okay. And then we're [ORGANIZATION]. So you get the [ORGANIZATION] gas card. If you get at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] gas card that's 10% off and then like half off car washes. [ORGANIZATION]. So. But why could they look at this condition? Well, we're just, we're looking at one, it was a [DATE_INTERVAL] and I heard 20 or [DATE_INTERVAL] very similar to this vehicle. We just went and looked at it and it was fairly light. Scratches everywhere and they're going to buff it out, they said. But if this one's in really great shape and nothing much of cosmetic, you're in the same ballpark with [DURATION] [DURATION] newer vehicle. So I'd be very interested in it. Yeah, for sure. I know with black sometimes you can probably find something, but. Yep, No, I hear you. Yeah, this one looks like they took it through the woods in [LOCATION] for about a [DURATION] [DURATION] trip and came back. Screw it. Yeah, no, I Didn't. I mean. And it looks like they had six kids with suckers [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] in it. So it hasn't been detailed yet. But I'll show my [MARITAL_STATUS] this one. Give my [MARITAL_STATUS]. I'm gonna show it to her as well. But we'll take a look at it and you wanna. I'll give you my number. Yeah. What's Your phone number? [PHONE_NUMBER]. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. All right, [PERSON_NAME]. And then yeah, I'll go out there too and give it a walk around and I'll send you a text. So when I send you a text, just reply yes. And then I can. I'll let you know, kind of condition and make sure it's here still. So. Yeah, I mean the things I look at is on the interior. I mean interior I'm showing you detail and looks good. But even if there's like noticeable dents or scratches and stuff, kind of I'm looking at just to get apples to apple a little bit on vehicles. So. Yeah, so don't have like scale dense and like a little ball peanut hammers and spots but they'll roll them out. But I prefer to have a nice clean vehicle if possible. Best. Best looking vehicle. I can't for the price anyway. Kind of money. Yeah, yeah. No, they're expensive. Yeah, I get it. It's amazing how I haven't shot vehicles in [DURATION] [DURATION]. It's amazing how much they jumped in [DURATION] [DURATION]. So. All right, I appreciate. Yeah. My name's [PERSON_NAME]. You want to just take a good look at it and if it has any dents or minimal scratch or whatever, I'd be very interested in. Yeah, for sure. So look out for that tax. Yes, we'll do. Thanks sir.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Please select from the following options. Select 1 for [ORGANIZATION], 2 for [ORGANIZATION] 3. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. Trying to get a hold of [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, this is her. Hey, [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. We talked earlier about the Sportage. Yes, sir. Did you get my email or. No, the only email I got was the one that had the original numbers. Then I sent one back asking about the back end, the paint, fabric protection and the Evo and I haven't heard anything since. Hold on one second. Oh, it went to my spam. I'm sorry about that. I did not see it. I know you know something that happens to me more times than you can imagine. So I've gotten to the point where every day at certain times I just go to my spam and see if anything is, you know, not spam because I was missing too much stuff. That's what I need to do because I'll get notifications that I got an email, but if it goes to my spam, I don't. So you were asking. All right, so basically I'll tell you. All right, see the paint, fabric protection for [MONEY_AMOUNT] and the Evo, whatever that is, certification. Okay. For [MONEY_AMOUNT], those are back end items. I'm trying to find out if those can come out of there. I'm trying to keep my customer within his, his shopping range. What range does he need to be in? Well, let's see, what do I have? See, there's a plus factor with it, but roughly around [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But like I said, there is a plus factor and I never know until I actually plug in the number. Gotcha. What that's going to be. So the way I usually like to work it is to send me your numbers, meaning dealerships, wherever they are. And then if there's room for backend, then I'll say, well, there's room and then just tell them what that number is. Okay, so let me grab my [OCCUPATION]. I don't know anything about back end, so let me ask him real quick. Okay. Yeah, it looks like roughly about $[MONEY_AMOUNT] worth of extras it looks like. And those are the two I mentioned, right? The paint and fabric and evil certification. Yep. And actually find out what the EVO certificate, I have no idea what the hell that is. I learned I seen that one, I went, what is that? Our Evo certification basically covers multiple things. For one, we do a 186 point inspection on the vehicle. That's to ensure the vehicle is lot ready and ready to drive off. It also covers a [DURATION] [DURATION] price match guarantee, [DURATION] [DURATION] return policy. It has. All right. Yeah, because I didn't know. Seriously, I thought was that electric vehicle something another. I didn't know what that stood for. No, EVO is like evolution, because. Evolution. Evolution. Okay. You gotta love the acronyms. Yeah. Find it for me, please, if you can. If you want, I can stay on the line if it's not going to be long, you know, so. Yeah, absolutely. Give me one second. All right. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, Mr. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. You know who Mr. [PERSON_NAME] is, by the way? Yes, I do. I kind of laughed in my head when I said it. Yeah, I laughed. I thought it was funny. I'm gonna transfer you to him so y' all can discuss that portion because again, back end is not my. My forte. I'm supposed to just tell the customers their cars are pretty light, so. Alrighty. And whom will I be speaking to? What's his first name? His name is [PERSON_NAME]. He's one of our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, thank you. Okay, no problem. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Hey, [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. How you doing? All right, so we're talking with. About what is the sportage? Give me [DURATION] [DURATION]. I just want to put the note. All right, so there was two items that were on here. I'm trying to find out if these are optional. It was a paint fabric protection in the evo certification. Mm, yes, sir. Okay. They are optional. Well, yeah, I mean, we. We put them on every car, so we. We try to keep those on the vehicles. Okay. Well, I'm confused if that means optional or mandatory. No, it's not. No, it's not mandatory, but. Except the back end is what I'm getting at. Correct. Right, right. Yeah. Because the only reason why is there's a. My customer has a certain number. I'm trying to keep them within. So if you have a minute, I want to try to just throw a number in here. I want to see if certain things work or not. Alrighty. Because our customers are pre. Stip. Pre qualified, so I already know they're solid numbers. Although there is a plus factor. And the only way I know is by actually plugging it into the system. Give me what your number is. I got five customers standing here in front of me. I can call you back, sir. No, no, you're good. No, you're. No, you're good. Let me work the number. Let me. I've got. You do. Well, my. My normal outcome right now. Right now I'm. Right now I'm sitting on an 80, 100 loser. To blow this car. Oh, okay. All right, so 19.3. And I'm. That's what I'm trying to find out how much plus factor I have. Okay, so that. That's what I'm gonna play with on here. Yeah. Just to see how far I can go. I'm at a. Like I said, this is a car I've had for a while, so I'm just blowing it out. And I'm at 100 loser right now, so. Okay, well, I can't. I can't bleed much more. All righty. I want to sell it more than you want to buy it, but I just gotta. Yeah, shoot me the you're out of blood number. Well, I'll tell you what it is. Verbally. I could. I could do. I could do [TIME]. I could do [TIME] out the door. [TIME]. I think I said [TIME]. Yes, that is correct. All right, let me. Give me two. If you really. If you have a second, I can just throw that number and it'll tell me right off the bat. Okay, I'm just gonna put. I'm just gonna put the OTT in there. All right, so calculate. Damn. No, it's highlighting big time. His monthly payment is going too high. What was it? What. Where are you trying to be at payment wise? Just give me a moment, sir, and I'm just gonna throw in number till that thing stops highlighting. You know, that's the way I find it works best. So let me. It stops highlighting by taking off. 2K is where it stops highlighting. So what is that? 20? [TIME]. Ish. Let's see. Yeah, I can't get to [TIME]. Okay. I could probably. I could get to [TIME] flat. [TIME]. Let me see if he has anything that he can put down. Okay. All right, cool. Let me know. Get back with you. Yes, sir.

I'm doing good, how are you doing? Doing very well. I heard you had a few questions regarding a new car. Yeah, the [DATE_INTERVAL], the two white Tacomas. I was just there and just drove through the lot and took a look at them and wanted to see what kind of deal you can make. Well, the question is which white Tacoma? What are you looking at? Well, there's two, so I guess, I mean the difference in the price is [MONEY_AMOUNT] and [MONEY_AMOUNT] on the two. All right, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna try to help you out as much as I can. So with our, you know, Tacomas, our new car inventory, you know, some of them are reserved with a deposit but one of them that I'm seeing that is available is that price range of [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The one that's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Yeah. I'm not sure about the other one that you saw, but it could possibly be reserved with the deposit. Because I'm looking at my new car inventory right now and the one that I'm showing available is that [MONEY_AMOUNT] price range. Okay. Yeah. I'd be more than happy to get you more information. The technology package. It does. Yep. And audio, the premium audio. Okay. Yeah. Do you guys have any incentives right now? I'm sure [ORGANIZATION] is offering, you know, special APR rates. It's all dependent upon qualifying with credit on that. But yeah, we're always looking to get, you know, a good deal. Yeah. Are you planning on trading in a vehicle or. No, no, trade in. Yeah, more so, just the bottom line price, not, you know, not really wanting to know, you know, what the APR is going to be more like, gotcha. What am I going to pay for the bottom line price of that vehicle? Okay. So out the door, you know. Yeah. So, yeah, wanting to know straight up, what's the lowest you can go on that [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Gotcha. Are you currently a Tacoma owner? We have been in the past. Gotcha. Have you had the opportunity to test drive a new one? Not a new one, but we know how they drive. We just wanted trucks. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. I have a number here ending [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PERSON_NAME], what is a good email address for you? You can send it and [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. All spelled, all spelled out [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Perfect. And I'm seeing some [OCCUPATION] adjustments, [TIME] on your website that'll bring it down to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But wanting to see after the [MONEY_AMOUNT] what you can do, what the things are. Yeah, no problem. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to act as if you were here, [PERSON_NAME]. Right. And we had fun test driving the car. And I'm going to give you our [ORGANIZATION] Select. It's going to show ways to protect your vehicle and then you're going to go, hey, you know, this is kind of what I'm thinking about purchasing the vehicle for. And I'd be more than happy to go to bat for you. Right. Okay. So is this the stock number [VEHICLE_ID]? That is correct. And so what I was going to do is send over the spec sheet, essentially the maroney of the vehicle just to make sure, you know, this is the right car that you are looking for. And then going to get you a [ORGANIZATION] select who's going to show you our numbers and then that's when I'll go to bat for you in regards to end all of the price of the vehicles.

"How can I direct your phone call? Hello? Hey. Hi. Thank you. I am calling. I can barely hear you. I am calling about a [ORGANIZATION] truck for sale. I'm sorry. What was that? I'm calling about a [ORGANIZATION] truck for sale. Okay, One moment. Thank you for holding. This is [PERSON_NAME] with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]. How may I help you? Hey, bro. I am calling about a truck you guys got for sale. Perfect. Where did you happen to see that vehicle? Our website or [ORGANIZATION]? I seen it on [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. Perfect. Did you see a stock number? Should be a letter followed by some numbers. Let me see here. I think I did, yes. So the stock number is [VEHICLE_ID]. Perfect. The reason I asked you for that number. Reason that what you see online is a very small representation of what we have available. Give me just a minute while I'm getting my computer system up here. How's your day going so far? You know, I'm doing all right for an old guy, you know that. Good. Now, I always like to ask, make sure everybody's having a great day because you never know what's going on out there. I was telling some guys at work, everybody's like, oh, it's so hot. Oh, I can't wait to get out here. I'm thinking, dude, come [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], you're gonna be proud. Rain for this kind of weather, right? I'm thinking the same thing. It's a little cooler, you know? Exactly. Now, while I'm gathering you information on that F350, would you potentially be interested maybe in a [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] or a [DATE_INTERVAL] if I had one with really low miles? Or is it just this particular one you're looking at? I. Can I be frank with you? Yeah, absolutely. I really don't give a shit either way. I stay within my price range. I guess what I'm concluding is that I have [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] to go before I [OCCUPATION]. Okay. So I am trying to upgrade everything now, you know, because when I [OCCUPATION], I'll be on a fixed income. You know what I mean? Sure. Absolutely. And now I really didn't want a black truck. So if you got something that's white, you know, I don't know if I can afford a lariat. That's why I was calling, to see the price. Okay. Price is the easiest part of my job. We're negotiating. Dealership. I could give you a price right now over the phone, but it's going to change when you get here. So we got to make sure we're Talking about the perfect truck before we can start talking about money. There's no right price for the wrong truck. Right. So I'm going to stop you there. I just want to know the price on the truck. I really don't give a shit how much it costs. I only have so much money. So once again, this truck and comparison to a [DATE_INTERVAL], which I don't think. Oh, yeah. And then when I start really weighing it out, I'm going to slap a camper on this thing. I'm going to pull my boat with it. Right on. I like your thinking. Yeah. So let's kind of cut to the chase. Tell me how much the truck is. Sure. And then we can Absolutely. We're asking [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] for this truck. But it's not the only [MONEY_AMOUNT] that we have in stock. We've got a lot of others. I'm sorry, what was that? Are your other trucks on a website? Yes, we do have a website. However, like I indicated before, the. What you see online is a very small representation of what we have. So sometimes there'll be. I just don't want to, I live in [LOCATION]. Oh, wonderful. I don't want to have to drive all the way out there for a goose egg, so. Well, I'll tell you what. I would be wasting my time if I brought you out here and was trying to waste your time. You know, I, I, I value your time just as much as I hope you value mine and want to do this the right way. How much is [DATE_INTERVAL]? It really depends if there's a lift kit on it. You know, we could probably find anything from, you know, this [MONEY_AMOUNT] mark all the way on up to as much as you want to spend. We just have so much available that it's, it's really tough to talk like that. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. So, [PERSON_NAME], I just got off work, so when I get home, can you just close. This is my phone number. Can you text me your website and I'll take look at it? What's that phone number? I don't have the caller id. Okay, so it is. And I like this. So I'm looking for a truck, but I plan on putting an overhead camper on it. And you know, I, I, yeah, so I, that's what I'm looking for. Four wheel drive. Okay. I know we've got some of those. I would love if they had a lift kit. Okay. For me it doesn't really have to be a lariat though. You know what I mean? Sure. You're Just looking for the payload. Yeah. So I have a line on a host camper. I think it's a dry weight on that thing. But then I have a huge fishing coat and I have a huge wakeboard boat that I need something to pull. Yep, that [MONEY_AMOUNT] is going to be just right for you. Now, are you free this coming weekend for [EVENT] [EVENT]? So I don't want to sound henpecked. I would have to talk to my [MARITAL_STATUS] first. Hey, a happy [MARITAL_STATUS] is a happy life. I got [MARITAL_STATUS] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. I knew all about it. Gotta check with the boss. Yeah. You know, so absolutely text you the website then. I will. Okay. I will make it home. I'll take a gander. What you got going on? What's your last name, sir? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Perfect. And your first name? [PERSON_NAME]. Very nice to meet you, [PERSON_NAME]. Nice meeting you, bro. I appreciate it. Yeah. That email or that website. And then I'm. Now, could we tentatively plan for something over the weekend? And if something changes, we could always adjust our schedule. So I'm going to just share a little quick story, what I've learned. I'm [PERSON_AGE]. Yep. A good friend of mine. I was sitting with a friend of mine yesterday when he got the phone call, said he had [DURATION] [DURATION] to live. He hung up the phone with his [OCCUPATION] and he looked at me and he said, what should I do? I told him if it was me, I go out and get [MARITAL_STATUS] to someone I can't stand what will not do. So, like, I. I don't know. But it'd be the longest [DURATION] [DURATION] of your life. Yeah, it sure would be. So once again, I. I have to talk to my other half and see what. I don't know if the kids are coming over. My kids are out of the house now, so I. Sure. Sure. You know what I mean? I don't know. I do. Or we're going. I. I don't know. It sounds like my house. The truck the other day, or whenever it came up and I. I put it off and I was thinking like, a black truck is so hard to keep clean. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So that's why I kind of want to look at this truck. You know what I mean? And then I seen another black truck and I was thinking, huh, that doesn't look. Look too bad. Just a pain in the ass. It's just cleaned out. Yeah. You know what, though? If you got the right kind of a attachment for the hose nozzle, you can't go wrong. Yeah, that's. That could be so give me [DURATION] [DURATION] website and I'll get back to you tomorrow. Sounds like a plan. We do also have a couple of 2017s that are lifted. Also, those ones just aren't diesel. Okay, but we got a lot of different stuff there. Yes. Okay, awesome. And make sure you include your name. Absolutely. Will. Looking forward to hopefully doing some business with you. I'll talk to you later. Thank you. You have a great day. Bye. Bye. Bye.",success,price_quote,F350,medium,False,0afe823195cf46c49e668d1c859b098a_transcript.json

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] in [ORGANIZATION]. Hey, I'm calling to try to get ahold of someone. I'm a [ORGANIZATION] employee and I'm looking to use my discount to buy a [ORGANIZATION] bolt. Okay. Have you been speaking with anybody here before? No, no, just getting some calls. I know it's, I mean they're discontinuing them, but I mean I figured if you wanted to get one of the last few ones this year, take less than [DURATION] [DURATION] for delivery, I'd assume. Yeah, I think, I don't know if I have any allocations, but I can look and see because if I just get it before [DATE_INTERVAL], I want to get that tax credit, you know. Yeah, yeah, for sure. So looking for a new [DATE_INTERVAL] or [DATE_INTERVAL]? [DATE_INTERVAL] would be for sure and then premium. I've got everything figured out. Unless you can get me better financing through [ORGANIZATION]. Should relate directly. I've already got financing figured out. I just figured I'd do. I don't know what you guys got. I think the biggest thing that usually we, you know, we can cross that bridge once we get to it. I think the hardest thing is going to be getting you, getting you a vehicle. Right? Yeah. I don't mind waiting even if it delivers in [DATE_INTERVAL]. As long as it delivers, you know, in this year. Yeah, yeah. I mean it looks like. Because it's looking like I have a lot of them on order, but I just don't know if you're like trying to build one. I don't know if I have any allocations. I have a little flexibility. I don't want to go crazy on the premium, premium features. I do need the premium, that premium trim. I just don't want to go crazy with all the. I don't need SuperCruise or any of that. Okay. I have a little flexibility. I want as close to the [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] as possible. If we can go to [MONEY_AMOUNT], I don't know because I get my [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] discount. I qualify and get a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] discount with my [ORGANIZATION] employee ID discount thing. Yeah. So as long as you guys will give that to me. I'm looking, just kind of looking to get, get that, get that roll on, get, you know, started if it doesn't work out or. I don't know. And so I mean really, the, the, the best way we could do it is just to maybe see because it looks like I have like. I didn't realize that I had this many that are already coming in Right. Well, hang on. Let's not shoot. I don't. I don't have any that are actually already built. That's what's kind of worried. Right, Right. Where do you. Do you work here in [LOCATION]? Is that. I do. I work. Right. At the [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]. Yeah, Just come in early and pick it up or have it, you know, whatever. I don't know how you guys work. I'm sure you've done stuff with employees before. Oh, yeah, yeah, Yeah. I think probably what I would do, to be honest with you, just so I could get a better. A better answer. I'm using this new order workbench, and I'm not all that proficient at it. Right. I'd like to see if I have any allocation. So really what I want to do is I want to take down your name and number, and then if I can, I'll just get back to you and see if I have vehicles that are either inbound that would work. And then I can. I can call you and try those on and say, hey, you know, I've got a. You know, I've got a gray one coming in or whatever. Right. And then I would send you, like, the build. Otherwise, I'd like to pick my new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] brain and see if I have any applications for new ones. What was your full name? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Last name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yep. And then [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, perfect. What's a good phone number for you again? And then you're looking for. So you're. You're looking for probably a 2LT. Yeah. 2LT. Premiere. Yep. This. I don't want anything past that. I forgot I was doing the configurator and I just. Just want. Just right on that line of premiere. I don't know. Nothing extra. Okay. I mean, that doesn't come with a convenience package or the heated steering wheel, usually. Yeah, you're just looking. You're just not looking to get into something that's like the. Yeah. I think it came out when the configurator on the employee website, before the discount, it was like [MONEY_AMOUNT] with delivery and everything. Yeah. So then bring it down to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So. Yeah, that's. That seems about right. A lot of the ones that are being built now that are. The 2lt are like right at that [MONEY_AMOUNT] mark. Yeah. Or something. Right. So. Yeah. Right in that ballpark. And as far as color, I don't want a white or like a silver but a dark, A dark gray or a black would be cool. No white. I'm just going to jot down some notes. Or silver. Okay. Dark gray or black. And then if you know for sure. Whatever, whatever you find. And then most likely you'll probably. Because I work second shift, you'll probably leave me a voicemail just because I'm basically work. Okay, just leave me a voicemail. Feel free to give every detail or send me an email. Email is. I don't know if you want that right now or. Yeah, later. Okay. Email. Just first and last name for you and then. Yep. Okay, send an email. Whatever you find. Yeah, I'll probably send another window sticker. Yeah. And then just I, you know, I'm assuming you know what the resale value is on those because I honestly I kind of want to keep it for like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. I'm so. I don't think I'm gonna love it enough to keep it, but I'm just pretty much getting it for the, for the tax credit and to try out an even, you know, save me [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then I'll pay it off in full and sell it. Probably I get right back to you guys for [DURATION]. I don't know. That's an idea I have. I'd like to keep it and I love it. Keep it like I don't know. But that's my current thought on I don't know. Off the top of my head. I don't know what resale would look like. Just to be blatantly honest with you. We don't get very many of them on the pre owned side. Right. And if we do, if we do that, they don't really last long. Right. That's what I figured. They'd probably go real quick. So I shouldn't be. I'm guessing because of their lack of availability and they're pretty demand. I don't think I'd lose too much. I don't think, I don't think you would have to worry about depreciation. Right. Right. I'm saving [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] in taxes, so [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right. So it's worth, it's worth it. Worth the savings because I don't want to always granted taxes this year for sure. So let me just, let me just see if I can get with my new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and see what I have for availability and then, and then I can get back. Yeah, awesome. That'd be great because. Yeah. And then do you. I don't know if what you guys got for? I got 800 credits, of course. I don't know, [ORGANIZATION] financing. Is it there any deals? Is it only cars that did a deal or is it just works? Last month. Last month I think they were focusing on pickups. But we can do. We can do that digging too. The first hurdle for me is just a car. Get something that you have and then that'll. That'll. That'll be a secondary hurdle. Okay. All right. Yeah. Okay, good. I'll do some digging. Awesome. All right. Any. Sorry, sorry. One more question, but you have time frame and take [DURATION] [DURATION] to get a reply? [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Oh, no, I'll probably reply between today and tomorrow. Okay, cool. Yep. Yep. Thank you. Awesome. Sounds good. [PERSON_NAME], I will talk to you very soon. Sounds great. All right, Have a good day. Later, man.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I actually called and spoke to someone earlier. I believe it was [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Is he around by any chance? Let's see if he's available. What'd you say your name was? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. You said [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. I'm sorry about that. Yes. Oh, it's okay. Hey, this is [PERSON_NAME]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How can I help you? Hello, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm so sorry. I was on mute. Hi, it's [PERSON_NAME]. We spoke earlier regards to the Ionic Five. Yes, ma' am. How can I help you today? Yeah, so we talked earlier about that third party financing. I did get a full approval from my bank and I haven't heard back from you all to make sure that I'm able to use third party financing. I kind of just want to know what to expect before I come in on Saturday. Oh, I'm sorry. I gave your info to my [OCCUPATION] and I asked him to, like, go ahead and give you a call and talk to you about that, especially putting a deposit down. But I know maybe you got busy and he forgot to let me go check up on him. I'm putting on a brief hold. I'll be right back. Hey, [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. I was going to ask, what bank are you financing with? [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. Thank you. I'm just gonna go. My [OCCUPATION] just asked me that, so I'm gonna go. Bring that back on the listener. Yeah, sorry. Sa. Hello? You still there? Yes, I am. So my [OCCUPATION] said we do accept [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and he wants to talk to you about, like, putting down a deposit and getting it reserved for you. Is that okay? Sure. Yeah. Is he on the line? I'm about to transfer you over there. I was just confirming with you. Oh, got it. Awesome. Yeah, I'll transfer you right away. Thank you. Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], one of the new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. How can I help you today? Hi. Yeah, so I was forwarded over to you or transferred to you rather, because I was fully approved for an auto loan via my bank and I was interested in getting the [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. I see you guys have the exact color and model that I wanted in stock. I was gonna have to pay a deposit, though. I mean, really, if. If you're. We work with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] all the time. Unless you're a little bit far away and can come in, you can come in. We can work everything. We work with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] all the time. So they just give you a check. What we do is you can test drive the vehicle and everything. Do you know the exact vehicle you're looking at? What's the trim? Yeah, so I gave, I believe it was [PERSON_NAME], the vin, the VIN number and the trim and all of that. And he said that there was like a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit in order to hold it. But I do have again a full approval on all of that. I just got that today. That's fine. Via [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. So no, I just need the last, the last eight of the vin. I am so sorry. He did give me a note earlier but I misplaced it here. We've been super busy. But if you can give me the last eight, I can pull out the car right here and give you where it's going to be in terms of out the door with the taxes and then you can just come in, test drive the car and if everything is good you just have to go get the check. Okay, so the last eight is [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay. Right here. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay. [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay. Got it right here. Okay. Is the limited all wheel drive correct? Okay, perfect. Here the outer door. Okay. With the discount? It's discounted from [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Your taxes will be [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The fee for the titling and licensing is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That would come out to a grand total of [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh perfect. When are you looking to come in for the vehicle and everything like that? To see if I can get. So it'll be Saturday morning. I actually already made an appointment. I got a text message to confirm my appointment so it should be at [TIME]. Okay. That's why he was asking for the deposit. I get it now. I got it. Okay. So in the case of the deposit, what happens is since you're doing a check from [ORGANIZATION], you can do the deposit the [MONEY_AMOUNT] to hold the vehicle due to the lack of availability on limited, it's non refundable because we. I'm sure you're looking for limiteds for a little while. It's been a little bit crazy. But we do the deposit and once you come in you just do that. If you have it in the check, we can either refund it to you into the credit card or we can just take a check for the amount of the vehicle minus the [MONEY_AMOUNT] hold on. And if for any reason I don't end up getting that car, is it refundable? How does that work? If I have. If I have to save it, it's not refundable. Yeah, that's. That's the thing. Because I. I have to hold it for you until then. Since it's a limited to hot car. That's. That's what we're doing for the moment. Again, that's entirely up to you. I'm not really comfortable paying if I have. By the way it goes. It goes towards. It goes towards the car. Yeah, No, I totally understand. Yeah. I haven't even been able to come in and actually see that. That particular car at your dealership. I was able to test drive one at a different dealership, but they didn't have the limited on that one. Yeah, I know. They're barely anywhere. I know. Let me see what I can work with, because I've been where you are right now. I know you want the car. Let me see what I can do to help you out. Okay. Don't go anywhere. I understand the excitement, so don't go anywhere. Let me see what I can. Okay, Sa. Okay, look, right now, they told me, unfortunately, if I don't have deposit, I cannot hold the car. However, from my end, I'm gonna keep the keys. Okay. If you want to call me, or I can call you every day just to let you know, if I have a customer, I have to make it available. So here's what I'll do for you, okay? I will call you tomorrow and tell you, hey, I got the keys, okay? They're still in my pocket. If I have a customer coming in for it, I'll call you to see if you actually want to make it in or do deposit or whatever you want to do. I'll give you the, you know, dibs, let's say, so that, you know, you can get it, because it's the only one I have. That's the only reason they're not allowing me to do it. I have available, but for mine, I'll go the extra mile there. I know it's not much, but I can do that for you. That'd be great. And full transparency. So I'm actually. I'm off tomorrow, but I will probably be in the [ORGANIZATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] from out of state, transfer my license over. So I have to surrender my old license. But if, you know, God willing, I'm able to get out of danger and you guys are still open, I can actually come tomorrow. But, you know, If. If. By the time I leave the [ORGANIZATION], you guys are closed. That's why I said Saturday morning. It was more so like a cushion. I got you. I got you. What I'll do. Here, hold on. Let me.

"Every day, sir. [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] speaking. How may help you? Hey, how you doing? I'm inquiring about financing. I was trying to see. Hello, I'm still here. Okay. I'm trying to find out, see if y' all guys had anything like some people with less than good credit. My credit is really shot. I've been trying to get a car, and I haven't not been able to get financed with any dealership. I don't want to waste anybody time not renting my credit anymore or something like that. I just came across our website. It was like fresh started, something like that. Let me ask you a few questions. Is this your first time purchasing a vehicle? I never had carbonate. I mean, I had one back [TIME] [TIME] day, but I think we paid it off. We did pay it off. I don't think it's still in my credit anyway. All right, so what you may have ran into is people who don't do first buyers program. We do it here for sure. Okay. I think my credit is [TIME] [TIME] five or something like that. You know what I'm saying? So I don't know if that's something y' all got. Okay, so what do I need to do? Are you available to come in today? No, I'm actually headed to work.

The question is, do you guys have any [DATE_INTERVAL] or any, you know, something comparable to it? We're just trying to figure out, you know, the insurance company hasn't told us, you know, their replacement value, but we're having a problem. We're having a problem trying to find a [LOCATION] [LOCATION] anywhere in this state. Mm. Yeah. [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. I've got a [DATE_INTERVAL], [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. That's on order. Means it's coming in on trade. It's not here yet, but it's going to be. I think I was. I think I was just looking at that on your website. Mm. The plot. Well, the. I don't know how to describe it. The color she's looking for, I don't think that one would particularly work. She likes the gray. And she's got a pretty good list of. I call it demands. Right. Once U shaped dinette, couch, fireplace and bunk. So I don't know if you have an Aspen trail that might be new that's similar to that.

[PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER]. Do any of you know. I'm just. How long before you find out what the insurance company's going to do for you? Probably within the week. Gotcha. How soon are you looking to get out camping and doing stuff? Well, we're. We. That's the nice thing about it. We. Actually, my brother in law has a camper right now. That can hold all of us. But, yeah, mom. You know, his mom. Obviously, she wants to get hers replaced. Sure. Yep. So we're just looking for something with a bunk. Where are you located, [PERSON_NAME]? Well, currently, we're. I'm actually in [LOCATION] today for [OCCUPATION] appointments, but we're out of [LOCATION]. Sure. Yeah. I mean, do you want to come. Come to the lot and see what we got here and see if we can come up with some ideas? I mean, she might be willing to do that when she gets out of the [OCCUPATION] office. I can tell her that. Yeah. Yeah. You're here in town, you might as well stop by. That way you can actually see stuff in person and get some ideas. Right. And find, you know, see if anything might fall into, you know, if you have. If she has a budget or whatever. If anything falls into, you know, budget. But yeah. So if I'm. I'm sitting at the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], Is that in range of you? [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Let me look it up here on [ORGANIZATION] Maps. I'm over by an old [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, directions. Yeah, so you're right off of [LOCATION] [LOCATION], I think. Yeah. So what you do is you. From there, you just go to [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. So you'll head east until you get to [LOCATION]. You'll go north on [LOCATION] [LOCATION] to the. The freeway. Then you'll drive an exit on [LOCATION] and head south. Okay. My [ORGANIZATION] Maps says It takes about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. When you head south, you'll see that. You'll see the big lot. You'll see the big flag. From the freeway, you'll exit and turn south on the freeway. You'll drive until you'll hit an intersection where there's a [ORGANIZATION] to the left. You'll go past the [ORGANIZATION] on the left, and there'll be an intersection. You'll turn left there. Once you turn left there, it's left onto [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. You'll come to a stop sign. At that stop sign, you'll turn left, and then you'll come to the. The lot. You'll turn right into the lot for [ORGANIZATION] there. So it's pretty simple. Okay. You can also cut through the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] or the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. It'll take you to the same road to get in versus going through the intersection, but the intersection is better because you get a protected light. Turn left.

So firstly, it looks like I'm going to be able to get there earlier. Can I come earlier and just get this done? Yeah, of course. Yeah. Okay. Whenever you're ready. We're ready. All right. Sweet. The second thing is I'd like to pay for a [ORGANIZATION] wire transfer. Is that possible? Most certainly. When you sit with the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], they'll be able to give you all the wiring information so that we can get that over to, you know, whatever institution you got to give it to. Okay, perfect. Yeah. I mean, I can do it while I'm in. I can do it while I'm in the store. Just send you a wire that's instantaneous. So the money will be perfect. Okay, perfect. And then just in terms of. I just want to make sure that, like, if that's all good, I can actually drive the car out today. Because if not, I'm going to bring my car. If not, I'm just going to take an Uber in. So the way. It's not that it's impossible, I would say, to the sake of you not being here [DURATION] [DURATION], because there's a little bit of a process. We got to send all the paperwork that you sign, hand it over to your insurance. Your insurance will stamp and send it back to us. We process the plates and usually if everything goes perfect, it'll Be like a [DURATION] [DURATION] process. And rather than have you sit, you know, we could schedule it for tomorrow or Thursday or you could, you know, come and then, I don't know, maybe Uber later on. You wouldn't need the Uber right away. You might want to, you know, step out, get something to eat while you wait for us to do what we got to do with your car. So, you know, getting it cleaned is quick, but registration and getting the place on the car, that. That could be a little bit of a. It takes some time. So is that. It normally takes about [DURATION] [DURATION], you say? Yeah, if everything goes perfect, where, you know, we get you in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], get you out, send everything over to your insurance. Your insurance is ready for it, they stamp it, send it back to us, we get it back into the office to the ladies in the office, go over the paperwork, register the vehicle, we get the plates on the car, then we get the [OCCUPATION] sticker on the car, make sure it's all gassed, and, you know, it's a little bit of a process. Okay. All right. It can be done. Don't get me wrong, it can be done. Rather than have you sitting. Correct. It's just about me sitting, waiting around for it. Okay. All right. I'll just go to this. I'm going to wash. Otherwise I'd come in, do all this work, and then just come and pick up the car tomorrow or whatever. Yeah, okay. All right, cool. All right. Thanks a lot, brother. Thank you. No worries, man. What time can we inspect her? I'm just at. I'm actually at the hospital with my [MARITAL_STATUS]. Nothing serious, just a checkup for our baby.

You have Riga transfer. We oversee the answers, please. Gotcha. Give me one second, all right? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], how's it going? Pretty good. Hey, man. The reason for my call is I got an email, I think it was from you, [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], saying, because I was interested in trading in my 21F150 lariat, but I just didn't want to be upside down. But you sent me an email saying that I'm probably on that right position to go ahead and get a trading for it. I don't know if you could tell me that steel. What was your name? So I can set you up real quick, sir. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I'll give you my phone number. Yeah, what's Your phone number? [PHONE_NUMBER], you say? Yes. Perfect. Is your name [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. Perfect. Let me see it. Yeah, you sent me an email or. Unless we're still not ready to do a trade in. You're not ready? No, I'm asking you. I just. I just don't want to be on the Upside Down. What happened, [PERSON_NAME]? What do you say? Absolutely. You have a F150, right? You said yes? I had it for [DURATION] [DURATION]. And. And I've been interested in trading it, to be honest with you, ever since last year. But I needed to wait a little bit longer. I don't know if I still need to wait another year. I just don't want to be on the Upside down. You know what I mean? Yeah. How much do you owe? What's that? How much do you owe on that? Do you know? Let me tell you this. Let me see. It came out to about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So every year I pay and I got a real low interest rate. So. [MONEY_AMOUNT], 12, 24. [MONEY_AMOUNT] times 12 times 24. 7 times 12. 2. Minus 70. Man, I feel about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it. Yeah. Because I got it for 70 and I pay 1100amonth. Every year? Every month. So I paid about $[MONEY_AMOUNT] on it. So, yeah. So as far as trading it in goes, you have to bring it up here so they can do an appraisal on it. According to your email, I think you gave me an estimate already? Well, I mean, of course you're not looking at it. No, no, you know what? I looked it up. I think they could give me a value like about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it. Yeah, most likely. Our website usually values off a little bit. It's just about. We have to go to our prices to it in person to give you the right number from here, I would say because I don't see where I sent you an email, but I'm still checking. Oh, you don't think why you did all. It just got me all excited for nothing. Oh, okay. I don't see why I said I didn't. Okay, I see. Well, I sent you an email now, so. Okay. Definitely see that. Okay. Yeah, but I guess I'm asking you that question since I owe [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it. If you guys can give me the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the truck, well, they. Will that break me off even or how does that work? Or does that. Or does that depend on what the truck is worth? The other one, how would that work? Unique truck. If you're looking to upgrade, which you are. You would basically. So if you did the deal, we would pay the rest of your vehicle off and then whatever. So you would. You would pay the rest of your vehicle off, which is what you owe on it, and then the other. Oh, I get. So, so. So in other words, if the truck is worth about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], I'm just starting all over basically. Right. Hello. Hello. Let me get this clarified information for you because I don't want to be giving you the long information at your phone, but yeah, and like I said, I mean just more or less, you know, you want to know where I stand at. More or less. I know of course that I'll get a way better. I'll get in the connect answer once I get there. But I just want to know more or less. Man, I'm sorry, you're breaking up real bad. What was it? What was that? I said I understand that you got upside down like on your new vehicle. Right. I'm going ahead and speak to my [OCCUPATION]. But what. What I could. What. What are their things that would happen? So in other words, in other words, it's probably better to keep the truck another year, keep paying it off so that way I won't be on the upside of it. I mean, that's not what I was saying. I was. I need my [OCCUPATION] because I don't want to give you the wrong information over the phone because I'm not 100 sure on that. Okay. The [OCCUPATION] is the one that would know. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah, I just talk to him and then I can give you a call back. Okay. All right. Give me a call back at this number, please. Thank you. What's that? Okay. Yes, sir. Perfect. Now go ahead and transfer that to my [OCCUPATION]. Okay. All right. Thanks, man. All right.",failure,trade_in,F150,medium,True,0b50a21e60414e2b9b36862204e9cdb5_transcript.json
"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may help you? Yes, sir, I was calling to see, do you guys do trade ins? We do. Okay, do you have any three row SUV's? Are you hearing the new or used or does it not matter? Well, used is fine. Okay. All right, so when you say three row SUVs, are you talking about larger ones or something like Acadia style, suburban style? What are you feeling? Acadia, they don't have to be too big. I mean, it's whatever. Something's nice and reliable. It don't have to be too big. It doesn't matter. I guess I have, I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Cadillac now, but me and my family look like the [PERSON_NAME] riding in it because it's so small. My kids are so big, you know. Oh my goodness. Which Cadillac do you have? It's a cts. Oh, so you're just sitting five people, huh? Yeah. And you know, like the, the cts, they're real narrow on the inside, so. Yeah, they are. I know exactly what you're talking about. But the car, I mean the car I have, it's a very beautiful car. You know, it's very well taken care of. The paint, body, it's not, you know, sun damaged anything. And I just put new or it has new tires, new brakes. We changed plugs, we changed the gaskets. You got to change them when you change the plugs. Okay. All right. Well, you know, really, it just depends on exactly what you're looking for. We've got in the new side, we've got some new [ORGANIZATION] enclaves, which are a third row midsize SUV on the same size as the Acadia. We do have some new Acadias. And then we have some pre owned, I believe we have a beautiful traverse, an enclave, and we have three or four others that are in that size. Now how many folks are you carrying around right now? There is five [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of us. Okay, so. But a lot of times we have more. And you know, I mean, my kids, you know, one kid is about 2 kids each, so. I see. All right, what's the youngest and what's the oldest one's [PERSON_AGE], [PERSON_AGE] and [PERSON_AGE]. And then the dog, I meant the dog is the half of us. Oh, that's the app. Okay. And then doing your [MARITAL_STATUS], correct? Yeah. What kind of dog do you have? It's a Yorkie. Oh, okay. All right, so [PERSON_AGE], [PERSON_AGE] and [PERSON_AGE]. Now they all boys. I know you mentioned one being a. They're all boys. Oh, Good. Lots of testosterone at the house, huh? Oh, my gosh. Okay. So, all right. Is there a price range you're trying to stay within? Well, what are your. I mean, I'm not trying to go too expensive. Okay. What's too expensive to you? I don't know. I don't know. I want something I can pay off pretty quick. Okay. All right, let's take a look here because, you know, that's the biggest things in today's market. Vehicles are growing more and more expensive. So it's just a matter of finding the best one for you. Now, when you say pay it off pretty quickly and you're looking at monthly payments, are we talking $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]? Higher, Lower. What are you feeling? Well, okay, probably like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], I guess. What is the lowest price range you have on your lot, like in pre owned wise? Well, I'm looking at that right now. Bear with me. So you definitely want a third row. All right, so if we went something pre owned, how many miles are too many miles for you? Just anything? Nothing over 200,000, I guess. Good enough. How many miles does your CTs have on it? 150. 150. Okay. And I apologize. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. Who am I speaking with? This is [PERSON_NAME]. And nice to meet you. Good to meet you. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, sir. And your last name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. Now, are you here in [LOCATION] or are you elsewhere? I'm here in [LOCATION]. Okay. So bear with me. I am scurrying because what I want to do is I'm going to put your information in our system. What I'm going to do as well is I'm going to send you a text with my information. Now, the number you're calling from is your cell number, is that correct? Yes. Okay, so first thing I'm starting with is sending my information. I just sent it. And let's take a look. See? So I'm gonna send you. So all your pre owned vehicles are kind of like newer as well? Or they are, simply because, you know, when you want to get something less expensive, sometimes you're looking at a vehicle that's probably going to be, you know, more headache than anything. When we sell vehicles here, we want to make sure that what we're selling you is going to allow you to be comfortable and you don't have to worry about having to constantly work on it because it's breaking down on you. Yeah. And that's the biggest Thing. Let me get over here. Here we go. And so do you guys do. Go by credit check as well or how do you do this? We do, we do credit. And it's a combination of a lot of things, really. It's going to be one, your credit score, two, what is on your credit, three, what you're buying, and four, what your income is. All right, so what I just sent you now, I sent you three vehicles that are less than 80,000 miles and are less than $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So you mentioned, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. These are going to put you in that price range with good credit. Not necessarily great credit, but all of these have three rows. Okay, and what kind of credit score are you looking at? Well, good credit is going to be [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] or better. Now, we do help people with less credit than that, so don't fear that. We just have to look at it and see what's going to work best with you. What little we're talking, I feel like maybe they're worried about your. You have some credit concerns? Yes, I do. My credit score is like [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], 20 something and. Okay. And I'm gonna be completely honest with you. I had got a vehicle under my name for my brother and it ended up. He ended up was not able to pay it, so it got repossessed. Okay, so that's on my credit, is it? I think it was like a credit. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] or. I don't even know it was. I don't know if it was through a bank. I don't. I don't remember going through a bank called [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. Yeah. How long ago was it? It's been [DURATION] [DURATION] back. And the thing with them is they screwed me on that car because the car was like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] and they're trying to charge me like I think it says, because I looked at my credit the other day and it said like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And I was like, I'm not. I'm not paying that. That car is not even worth it. You know, the total price of the car was, I believe it was like $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So. Okay, all right. I know it makes me look bad. No, no, don't worry about it. Unfortunately or fortunately unfortunately. How do you want to look at it? There's plenty of people out there with lower credit scores than they'd all like. And unfortunately, bad things happen to good people. So we're going to try to work through all that. Now, your vehicle with it being an [DATE_INTERVAL] with the miles on it, it's not going to be worth a whole lot, but we can certainly do everything we can for you. And the other thing to think about, too, with the credit scores in that line, you're probably going to need to put some actual money down as well. Are you able to do something like that? Yeah. Well, how much would. How much? And then how much would. For the car. All right. So anytime you're dealing with credit challenges like you're mentioning here, banks want to see you put some skin in the game. That way, if things get hard, you're going to do everything you can not to lose that money, and that's usually in around the range of about $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Now, we'll certainly go to the table with any amount, because we'd rather let the bank say no than us say no. But the more money you have, it's certainly going to help, because as nice as your Cadillac is, It is, what, 16 years old, and there's not a big market for it. So the best thing for us to do, [PERSON_NAME], is to set up a time for you to come in, and let's just look at the whole picture and see what the best opportunity is for you and your family. Now, is this going to be something we're going to put in yours and your [MARITAL_STATUS] name? I mean, we can. If it will help. Yeah, it certainly will, but it's not. I can put it in my. Okay, well, you know, I don't like to give him the big head of, like, oh, it's my cartoon. You know, unfortunately, this thing called family, you kind of have to do that. But let's do this if you feel comfortable doing this. I feel like maybe working towards a pre approval before you come in is going to be the thing to do. So if it's okay with you. Are you pretty handy on the computer? Yes. All right, I'm going to send you the link to submit your credit, and if you want to go ahead and submit yours and your husband's, we'll look at both and see which way is going to work better. Either you by yourself, him by yourself, or you together. And if we can do that, then I can look at your credit or my bosses will, and they'll give me an idea of what it's going to take to get an approval and where we're going to sit. And then I can can kind of work backwards and find vehicles that are going to keep your payment where you want them versus showing you something that you fall in love with. And it turns out your payment is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah, I'm not doing [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, I understand. I understand absolutely 100%. So I tell you what, if it's okay with you, I'm going to send you the link and I'm going to just send you a VIN to a vehicle because sometimes the system will ask you for a vintage. And. Okay, all you've got to do is just punch that in, punch you and your [MARITAL_STATUS] credit in. And then what I'll also need to do is get a photo of your driver's licenses. That way we can prove who you guys are, and legally we'll be able to look at your credit and start working on that kind of stuff. Okie dokie. Okay. All right, so I'm gonna do that. You've got my information. Again, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. Give me about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. I'm going to try create another text message with all the information I need. And once you fill that out, send the driver's license over to me. That's my cue that you've done it, and then we can get to work for you. Now, what is your [MARITAL_STATUS] name? [PERSON_NAME]. Same last name? Yes. What's his phone number? Do you know off the top of your head? That's two phones, so I don't know. Yes. All right, so, [PERSON_NAME], again, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. Give me a few seconds. I'm going to send that link over to you, and then you just submit all that information, send your driver's license, and we'll get that pre approval rolling for you. And then from there, are you able to come in, say, in the morning time or tomorrow afternoon? I could go in tomorrow morning. Okay, fantastic. Well, let's get this done. And the faster you get that back to me, the faster I can get a pre approval set up for you, and then we can find the best time for you in the morning. Okay. All right, thank you so much. I appreciate the opportunity. Thank you. All right, bye bye.",success,inventory_check,unknown,medium,True,0b61ee4ba03248e4b51c94eb20adf77c_transcript.json
"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] for new car sales, press [PHONE_NUMBER] pre owned sale for service. Wait while I transfer your call. Good afternoon, [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How you doing? Is it [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. What's up man? Trying to get a price on new Prius. I know you guys got those, you guys got those sales going on like the, I want to say they're the lease deals for either the, the regular Prius or the Prime. What's up? What's up with those? Where, what kind of lease are you trying to get? Like any trim? I mean they're all different. I mean honestly I, I didn't want to lease at all, but the financing right now that you guys have kind of sucks. There's nothing really promotion wise going on. So I mean there's a, I have one Prius, it's a little over $[MONEY_AMOUNT] that should be off the boat in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. I mean it's going to depend what the program discount is at the time. But it just depends. It depends on how many miles you want to do per [DURATION]. It depends on how much money you want to put down. You know, it depends on your credit. Yeah, no, I know based off that but I'm saying with the promotion, like I know you guys got right now, it's the SE All Wheel Drive one. That's the regular Prius. That's [URL]. yeah. All right, so like say we put an order for SC Prius, right? And how much money is it down? Like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Hold on, let me bring it up. Yeah, so the Prius Prime. So The Prius Prime One is. Yeah, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Do it for me plus taxes, bank, person, place, which is like another [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So you basically put $[MONEY_AMOUNT] out of pocket. So when it says do it signing, that's not including. Yeah, so click. No, there should be a little print under what you're reading, right? Yeah, of course. I'm always driving when I just saw it. Yeah. And then it's gonna say the offer excludes taxes, title fees, dealership fees, options. So I mean you wind up putting more than double what you expected. And then we usually don't have the cheap car they're even promoting. But yeah, if you were willing to put [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down on a lease and do a [MONEY_AMOUNT] mile base mile Prius, I'm sure I could get you, you know, in that, that [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], that [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] range. Yeah, but the thing is everyone sees that and they don't want to put that much money down and they need more miles and they want to go with a more expensive car. But we work with you, it's just that car doesn't need that. Yeah, I mean that buy cars all the time. So I'm not new to this. Yeah, I know. What's up with all that? No, I'm pretty straightforward, man. I'll get. Give me the rundown with your [OCCUPATION]. Are you guys charging over MSRP on Princess? Yeah, on everything. Are you really still. Absolutely. Every [ORGANIZATION], man. That's crazy. You know, people get their trades and they're getting their money for them too, you know, what are you like, what's the closest. What are you guys doing on them? I mean, we don't, we don't have any Priuses. Yeah, I'm not in the rush. I have a Prius already, but there's no Priuses here. And I have four coming and one of them I just got and the other three that are closer already sold. All above msrp. There's no incentive to discount a Prius even close to msrp. If you wanna. I mean, if you want a deal and I have a camera that's been sitting here for [DURATION] [DURATION], I could probably get you a little over. Yeah, I need the Prius. I need like the hatchback style back the. With the seats that go down and you know, all the bullshit. Yeah. I gotta put it. I got a [DATE_INTERVAL] is the best, best piece of. I've ever bought. So. I mean, dude, it's a great car and you get what you pay for and it lasts. Yeah, I mean it's a word. It's a work car for me. So that's, you know, [ORGANIZATION] doesn't have fluff, you know, and, and markup in their cars. Like, you know, and we're not getting any. So msrp, like people usually go to [ORGANIZATION] or something for that. Gotcha. So nowhere. What. What is the. The bottom [MONEY_AMOUNT] on msrp? On one, that would be like an ordered one. Not even. I don't. I mean I could see doing like a two over Prius deal. Gotcha. But right now there's nothing financing going on. Right. I mean, [ORGANIZATION] does. Yeah. You know, not the cars that we want. Yeah, not the cars that aren't available. You know, like the stuff that, like that they want to move. Like the Camrys, the Highlanders, some of the RAVs, a little more higher. On the RAV hybrids, like there are rakes, but it's not like it was. [ORGANIZATION] is not, you know, the [ORGANIZATION] loaning out money at 7% and they're buying the rate down. It's going to be like a 4 or 5% rate, not.012 rate, you know? Yes. There's nothing I. Can I get you the best deal I could. It's just you're talking about coming in, writing the order, taking [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] to find you a car, and then, you know, getting you the fairest deal possible based on where the market's at. All right, man. It's definitely not changing for a few [DURATION] at least. Honestly, I don't think [ORGANIZATION] really. Their business model is going back to how it was. Yeah. [ORGANIZATION] never been the best with their promotions. At least they don't have to be. You know, the cars hold better value and last long. That's all you need. It's better than taking $[MONEY_AMOUNT] off the sticker price and then the car blows up at [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles, you know? Yeah, I know. I put over 20,000 miles on this car [DURATION] of the [DURATION] and I don't put a [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Just change. Just change. Yeah. I mean, you get what you pay for. Exactly. Yeah. So, I mean, would you rather pay a little more now or a little more fixing the thing? You know, it just depends on your value system. But I mean, if you want to come down and see me, dude, I'll try to get you as close to the list as I can. You know, it's just. It's tough because it's an order. You have to try and get you the car. Wow. How far have you bought cars from the water? Not from that [OCCUPATION]. [ORGANIZATION] doesn't do really orders. Right. Like, they're not going to build the car for you. We're not getting anything extra. We can just request the car. Or we have to give up something we already have coming for the car you want. They're not going to just. It's not like [ORGANIZATION]. You could just go in, put in an order and wait [DURATION] [DURATION] and get exactly what you ordered, you know? Yeah. What you want. Yeah. And then. And then get it for you. And then, I mean, to be safe, you say like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], you know, but until that car is coming in allocations. I just got the new Traverse for the kids and stuff like that. So that was one of those supposed to be [DURATION] [DURATION]. That ended up being like [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah, [DURATION] [DURATION] sounds. I mean, I could see everything that's like [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] out. I could see Priuses, I could see what's on the boat, what's coming Here I could see what's going to be built, I could see what's in the port getting transported here. And there are no, there is no Se Priuses. I have two XSE primes, one solar not and one XLE oil drive that's sold. The only one you have that's available is the X XSE all wheel drive, one no XSE prime and it's getting on the boat and tomorrow. So if they load it on the boat tomorrow, I mean that's a [DURATION] [DURATION] boat ride. It's not going to be here until like [DATE_INTERVAL], like [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] maybe. Gotcha. Yeah, that one's out of my price range anyway. That's like [MONEY_AMOUNT] local. I mean this, the sticker on it is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] is MSRP. So I mean I plus destination. We don't charge the destination. Well, what's the, what's the other fee? I forget what it is. You have a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] price delivery processing handle. Yeah, yeah, about. Yeah. But I'm including that. That's part of the MSRP price on the window sticker. Oh, so the final is the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's the final window sticker price is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. If I got you like two over, you'd be like almost [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] pre tax. It's white with black and red soft exceeds. Nice car, man. Yeah, no one's actually a decent final. Wireless [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay, Android Auto. I mean big screen, wireless car charger, everything people wanted, you know, they really. It's a nice car. Yeah. I'll try to get you good money for yours if you want to get out of it. Whatever you want to do. It's probably, probably not even worth it. I got [DATE_INTERVAL] with like 170,000 miles. I'm probably better off just selling it private. I mean it sounds like price like a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] car. Yeah, it's give or take but it's all beat up panel wise. So for you guys it's not a car that a [OCCUPATION] is going to sell. No, we, I would just Wholesale. Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't care. I wouldn't keep something like that. Yeah, I would just have to see what the difference is from, from a private sale to a trade in with the tax credit. Yeah, yeah. I mean you're not gonna get much tax credit. It's only like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for every thousand. Yeah. So I'm only gonna get [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Maybe [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, yeah. I mean but still, I mean I'm throwing rough numbers out there, but yeah. I mean, private. Private. Big. They go on between [MONEY_AMOUNT] and [TIME], so I'm sure. Yeah, right around is the max that I would get from you guys anyway. I don't know. I mean, sometimes I'm not always right with that kind of stuff. If you want to come down tomorrow or something, I'll get the car looked out. I'll print you out of V spec of the one coming in, and I'll see what my other stores have coming, and I'll try to, you know, get the right car for you and make it work. Yeah, I'm. I'm on [DURATION] up until Friday, so my. My birthday, I work in the city and I live out in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], so that by the time I'm back home is kind of too late anyway. So. Like, a weekend day. Yeah, more. More. So either Friday or I'm all Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So I'm here Friday, Saturday, I'm off. Wednesday's Thursday, so I literally. Friday is like, my Monday, and then I work till Tuesday. Yeah, my schedule is always switching around. If you want to come see me Friday, Saturday. Yeah, I'm gonna. I'll probably do that. What. What time you get in on Friday? I'm here [TIME] to [TIME]. [TIME] to [TIME]. All right, cool. And what was your name again? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Nice to meet you, man. I'll show you a quick text, if that's cool, and then you text me if you're coming down. Yeah, shoot me a text and then. Was it okay? All right, [PERSON_NAME], hopefully I'll see you Friday, man.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out who. What vehicle did you buy? I didn't even know. I didn't buy one. You ran my credit and it was supposed to be one hit. And I got four hits on my credit now. Okay, well, I'm not sure. I don't think I ever pulled your credit. So I think you may have me mixed up with someone else. Do you know who the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] was that was looking at it? The guy that I spoke with, he was maybe [PERSON_AGE] or [PERSON_AGE]. He had [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. He maybe had [DURATION] goatee. Okay, yeah, I believe.

We look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you again for your patience. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, are you the one I was speaking with yesterday around [TIME] or [TIME] [TIME]? My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Were you working with [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, yes, yes, I remember you, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, yeah. I'm really mad because I have four hits to my credit now from yesterday. Four hard inquiries. Well, I told you yesterday I would send it to two or [MONEY_AMOUNT] banks. Two or [MONEY_AMOUNT] credit. I asked you how many times it's going to be [DURATION] hard inquiry on my credit and you said it will all count as one. There's four. I said if it's all pulled within the same [DURATION] [DURATION] period, so they're going to pull it. It'll show where it was pulled by us, those [MONEY_AMOUNT] credit unions. But like I said, if it's done within [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] period, it's going to hit your credit about five points. I know that it was going to hit it for five points, but there's. I have an extra four hard inquiries on there now, not one. We discussed it and you told me it would count as one and there's four. [PERSON_NAME], I had explained it to you. I can't do [DURATION] soft pull. It is [DURATION] hard pull. When I pull your credit and when I send it to the banks, they pull your credit too. But like I said, you told me that if you run it all within [DURATION] [DURATION], it will only hit my credit as one hard inquiry. Told me four. You said one. Because I even reiterated that to you because I was concerned and you said yes, it's all within [DURATION] [DURATION] it will be count as one hard inquiry. I had no idea that it was going to be four. [PERSON_NAME], I had told you yesterday that the bank is going to look at your credit too. I just can't stand [DURATION] credit bureau. Did you, did you or did you not tell me that it was going to be one, that it was all going to count as just one? Because it was in [DURATION] [DURATION]. I had told you what we do is we do [DURATION] hard pool here. If you give me your credit and you sign off on the credit and I do [DURATION] hard pool, it is by law I have to send it to the bank to try to get it approved for you. I know that you were doing that, but you also told me it would count as one hard inquiry because I was concerned about that. And you said everything within [DURATION] [DURATION] will be one hard inquiry. And I have four. I said within 20. I said if I send it within [DURATION]. So within [DURATION] [DURATION], if it's an identical application, it's not going to hurt your credit. Like five points here. Another five points. Another five points. What I was telling you was, is it's only going to drop your credit about five points. Okay. You know that you told me it was going to be one and it's four. Now you, sir, I would have never agreed to that. It was presented to me as if it would be one, not four. [PERSON_NAME], you had. You had given us, you had given us your credit. You assigned all. You had given us your credit. Yeah. You run it one time. Not for I gave you permission to do [DURATION] credit check once. Not for. [PERSON_NAME], before I pulled your credit, I came to tell you I was sending it to two or [MONEY_AMOUNT] banks, two or [MONEY_AMOUNT] credit unions and that you also told me it would all count as one. This did not count as one. I have four different lenders on there now that I did inquiries for. For it being in your credit, it counts as one. For it being in your credit to five points, it counts as one time. This within [DURATION] [DURATION] period. If I was to try to go ahead and try to send it again on Monday, that would hurt your credit. It made my inquiries go up by four. That hurts my credit more that I have four extra inquiries now. That was never explained. It was explained as if it was going to be one. But I guess you're going to tell me that you did not tell me it was going to count as one, right? I tell you that I do one hard pull here. One hard pull, yes. At my school, yes. That was the way it was presented. You did not say that I was gonna have four pulls on my credit. When it is sent, when it is sent over an identical application to those [MONEY_AMOUNT] lenders, it's not going to ding your credit more than the five points that I told you. I told you it was going to ding it even if I did one pool. And then when I sent it to those [MONEY_AMOUNT] banks and they do their own pool. I spoke yesterday about how many hits it's going to be. You said it will all count as one. This is not counting as one. It's counting as four hard inquiries that I have. And you did not make that clear at all because I even repeated and said this will only count as one. I, I said that numerous times. And you said, yes, [PERSON_NAME], I have sat down and talked to you for about [DURATION] [DURATION] explaining to you what I was going to do. And I also said numerous times, am I going to have multiple inquiries or is this going to all count as one? And you said yes, whenever something's full within [DURATION] [DURATION], it will only count as one. It did not count as one. It four. Okay, so, all right. So I guess you're not going to admit that you knew this and just decided not to tell me this. I'm reiterating what I spoke to you about yesterday. Did I or did I not say yesterday, is this only going to count as one? And you said yes, because it'll be within [DURATION] [DURATION] period. It will only be one hard inquiry. Did you tell me that? I told you yesterday that it would affect your credit as far as your score. It'll affect your credit the score the same as if I was to pull it once, send it to two or [MONEY_AMOUNT] banks, it's the same. It's going to hurt your credit. Five points. Whether I did one or if I sent it to [MONEY_AMOUNT] banks. It's still, it's still the same. It's not identified. I'm not talking about the five points that it lowered it. I'm not talking about that. I was not told that I was Going to have four hard inquiries on there. Because I was. I was. I wasn't even sure about the one. And you said, no, it will just be one, not four. We did. We did one hard pull when you gave the okay for me to send it to the credit unions. They have to pull your [ORGANIZATION] score. And like I said, if it's. You should have told that it was going to be four hard inquiries, not one. Because the way you explained it, you said, you're doing one pool. You did not say, that'll turn into four. And I said numerous times, this will just count as one inquiry, right? And you said, yes, numerous times, knowing that wasn't true. But now you're going to sit here and tell me that you didn't say that. I did not say it the way you're explaining it. No, I did not. Did I say, is it going to count as more than one inquiry? And did you or did you not say, no, it will not. Originally, you came in asking if I could do [DURATION] soft pool. I explained to you what [DURATION] soft pool was. If I actually. And I did. You're right. I did agree to have one inquiry, not four. You asked about how it would hurt your credit. I told you it would hurt. It would drop it. We're not talking about how it's going to hurt my credit. I said, is it going to make it one hard inquiry? You said, yes, it will only be one. You did not say four. Because I know that I restated that many times because I was concerned about something like this. You know what I meant when I said that. You just didn't tell me. I guess I misunderstood what you were saying because you were talking. I don't think you misunderstood what I was saying. I think you did perfectly understand what I was saying because you kept telling me, no, it will only count as one because it's within [DURATION] [DURATION]. Why would I go in there as worried as I was about doing it once? Why would I go in there and be okay with it four times? You knew that. You just chose not to. You chose not to tell me that. I tried to tell you everything I possibly could because you were so hesitant. I tried to explain it to you the best of my abilities because you were so hesitant about it. Yesterday you explained that it would only lower it by five points. You said that. But I also said, how many inquiries will it be? And you said one, that it will only count as one, not four. Am I lying about that or did you tell me one? I thought you understood When I said I'm sending to [DURATION] credit union, no, I would understood four. If you would have said four, I would understand that you didn't. You said that it was going to count as one. I did tell you I was going to send it to two or [MONEY_AMOUNT] credit unions. Are you okay with that? You said yes. You made it sound like you were doing one pool and that that's what it was going to be. [PERSON_NAME], when I said that, when I. When I said the hard and I knew that, that I would have agreed to four, do you think that or was it. You said yourself I was hesitant to do one. No, I don't know what to think anymore because I thought you understood what I said yesterday. [PERSON_NAME], I was talking about in terms of your credit score. Did I say is it going to only count as one? And did you say yes, right or wrong? Am I making this up or was that said? [PERSON_NAME], I think I need to get you transferred over to my gym because I've tried to helping you. I'll let you talk to him. I'm just asking you [DURATION] question. Was that said or not? The way you're putting it? No, it was not. I didn't say the number one. And you said yes. I explained to you when I sent to these other credit unions and they pull your credit, they are going to pull your credit. I did remember telling you they're going to pull your credit. You may sound as if it was one time because I repeated that numerous times to be sure. I even said to you that I was concerned because before, whenever I ran it numerous times, it did not count as one. And you said no, that something went wrong with that. That that wouldn't it. [PERSON_NAME], I knew you were hesitant yesterday. That's why I wanted to talk to you again before I actually pulled your credit. I got [DURATION] signed credit application from [PERSON_NAME] and I wanted to sit back down with you to make sure we were clear on everything. I was not. And I also said is it going to hit it one time? And you said yes. And I said I was worried because before, whenever I had applied for [DURATION] car [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, it hit it more. I had more than. And you said that that doesn't sound right. You're not sure what happened with that, but no, it would pull my credit. Once you said it will be one hard inquiry. Because I said you're sure it's going to be one? And you said yes, it is. [PERSON_NAME], what I was telling you was it is one hard pull from us now when they, when they know it's four. [PERSON_NAME], I've been. We've been going around this for. For [MONEY_AMOUNT] or four times. I'm trying to explain to you what I said, but you're not listening to me. What? It went out when I was talking to you. You talk. You were talking about that. Why would I have agreed to have it pulled four times whenever I clearly said to you I did not want that to happen, that I did not want it. You know that I said that to you. I told you it was going to drag your. It was going to drag your score down five points. And when. I don't care about the. I don't care about the five points. I care about the four hard inquiries. Didn't you tell me it was going to count as one hard inquiry if things were run within [DURATION] [DURATION]? Did you say that to me? No. I said when I sent it to these other credit unions. Yes, you did. [PERSON_NAME], I'll let you talk to the [ORGANIZATION]. I can't help you. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [DURATION] lot in [ORGANIZATION].

We look forward to talking to you momentarily. Thank you again for your patience. Thank you for holding. This is [PERSON_NAME] speaking. Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I believe I was just speaking with [PERSON_NAME]. He's in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I was there yesterday around [TIME] or [TIME] [TIME]. There was [DURATION] woman helping me. And then he explained to me, yes, he did say it will negatively impact my score by 5 points. But numerous times I stated, will this be one hard inquiry? I even said that I had [DURATION] problem [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago to where it was more than that. And this was. But I didn't have four from any one dealership. That's ridiculous. But he said that that should never happen. It didn't make sense or something to that effect. But I said numerous times, is this going to count as one pool? And he said yes, anything within [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] will be one hard inquiry. Because I was extremely worried about that. And he's. I know he's saying now that that's not how he said it. That's absolutely not true. So I would like you to pull the tape if you have [DURATION] recording in that woman's office of what was said. Bless you. For privacy reasons, we don't have recordings in the offices. So one thing I can tell you, when we pull the credit, it is indeed one hard inquiry. Okay? But if you're trying to purchase [DURATION] car and it looks like you were, the only way [DURATION] bank is going to receive your credit is whenever we pull the credit, it has to be sent over to the bank, okay? That's the only way that you're going to be able to get approved for auto loan. There's, there's no way around that. There's no way that we can, you know, make that information get to the bank without them pulling it themselves. Okay? Because they have to abide by the way it was explained because. Okay, but that was not explained to me like that it was explained because I even stated again to reiterate to him and said, will this be one hard inquiry? And he said yes numerous times. Right. So I don't understand if there was going to be more than that, why wasn't told about that? Well, for one, one thing I can tell you is for he's honestly speaking for the dealership, the banks, you know, we, we can't guarantee you if you, you may have [DURATION] pre approval with some, some of these banks already. And there's times where sometimes they don't even have to pull because they might have [DURATION] pre approval already in house. So they don't have to. So we speak on our behalf, we don't speak on the bank's behalf. But I mean, here's one thing I'll tell you. If you're not buying [DURATION] car, let's just say because people have to buy transportation, that's something that people understand. So if you haven't went shopping and had your credit pulled by [DURATION] ton of different dealerships, that, that little pull that it did on your credit, that that damage, it's eventually going to come off. So it's not like I have four though. Not like I have four from yesterday. That's [DURATION] lot of hard increase to have now is four more. Well, I mean, I mean, I understand the frustration and I understand the miscommunication and I apologize. I'm gonna tell you, listen, there was not miscommunication. He knew I was extremely, extremely apprehensive to have one hard inquiry. I almost didn't even let them run my credit. I was so worried about having another hard inquiry. He assured me it would be one numerous times. There's no way if I was explained that, oh, I'm going to, it's going to be four. Because I was worried about something like that and I even so that's why I directly asked, is this going to be one, is this going to count as one hard inquiry? I asked that at least twice and he told me, yes, there is no way. And he knows there's no way I would have been okay with four. Well, so no, I do believe he knew that, decided not to tell me that. Well, no, it's not that. It's not that he knows that. It's just when, you know, when he, when somebody asked him, you know, how many inquiries? Or is it gonna hit me when you pull my credit? You know, we only pull the credit one time, you know, we can't speak on the bank's behalf. But once, you know, you give [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], you authorize us to do that. So, you know, we're. I would have never authorized. And that thing is, I didn't ask him how many. I specifically said the words, is this going to all count as one? And I said that more than once. And he said yes, every time I asked. And he even said everything, that within [DURATION] [DURATION] will all count as one. He said that too. But no, he told me this will all count as one hard inquiry because I told him I was concerned that [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, one day I went to [DURATION] [DURATION] dealerships and I had like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And he said, well, that shouldn't have happened. It should have just been one. I don't know why he said that, but no, I do think that he knew it was going to be four, but because of my apprehension, he just let me believe it was going to be one. Okay, let me see something real quick. Yeah, I mean, I don't see. Only thing I see is he did the poll. I'm looking into it right now. He did the poll and it went to [MONEY_AMOUNT] credit unions. You know, and like I said, they have to pull your credit to determine whether or not that you're going to be qualified to buy [DURATION] vehicle. I really think that should be explained to somebody and they should not be pulled. Once he said, I'm only pulling it one time. He did not say. And that doesn't. And then everybody else, he said, it's going to count as one. I'm not sitting here lying to you. If I was not told that, there's no reason that I'd be calling you upset today because I was told that that's why I'm upset. Right. I get that completely. I don't know the context of exactly what happened. Right. And I will definitely have [DURATION] conversation with him to make sure that if. That, if that's exactly how it went, then that won't happen again. But at the same time, it's one of those things where he may have told you in the beginning, hey, it's going to impact your credit. You know, I'm going to do one inquiry. And then, you know, there's [DURATION] lot of times where that will happen. And then there's another conversation right after where, hey, this is going to impact you [DURATION] little bit. Typically, that's what our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] do. You know, they'll let somebody know. Like I said, he can't really give you an exact number because if you had [DURATION] pre qualification, then he's not going to know exactly how many times because there are Times if I had [DURATION] pre qualification I would have told him. He knew I didn't have [DURATION] pre qualification. It was not that type of scenario. It was [DURATION] scenario to where I was very worried about doing one. He said, he did tell me that he was going to have to pull it. And then I, I said numerous times, this isn't going to reflect as numerous inquiries on my account, on my credit report, is it? And he said numerous times, no, it's just going to be one. And I don't know why he told me that because had he told me that it was going to be, even if he said two, I would have said no. Okay, yeah, like I said, I don't know the conversation. Only thing I can do is talk to him about it and you know, find out exactly what happened or why. Typically, you know, what will happen is we'll pull just to see where somebody's at and then from that point we'll get permission. Hey, are we good to send this to [DURATION] few places? And we don't do that until we're confident. Some dealerships, I can promise you these [MONEY_AMOUNT] banks, that's [DURATION] very small amount. So I can tell he was definitely being very delicate with everything so that you wouldn't get impacted. Because I've seen people that come into the dealership that have 20 plus inquiries and that's from like [DURATION] [DURATION] timeframe. So you know, that sort of amount of inquiries is not going to affect you in [DURATION] negative way when it comes to purchasing [DURATION] vehicle. I understand it's more than you wanted, but as far as the actual point effect that you got from it, you know, he was pretty spot on with that and I have no problem with that because yeah, it did drop it like five points. I'm not mad about that because I was told about that. I'm mad because I was told it was going to be count as one inquiry. That's why I'm upset. If, if I'm told something and it happens, fine. I just, I felt like it was, it was just dishonest because I would have never agreed to that. Yeah, and like I said, I understand your frustration and I apologize that that happened. You know, I just, unfortunately the only thing I can do is just talk to him and find out exactly what the situation was. There's some times where it's not always something that could be [DURATION] message gets relayed back to them because it's just we work with [DURATION] lot of customers each day when we get busy, people are trying to buy cars. It's Our job to make sure that we get them in vehicles and to work with the banks and that kind of stuff. Maybe there was [DURATION] miscommunication somewhere down the line. Unfortunately, that does happen sometimes. But, you know, I will definitely, you know, talk to him and find out, you know, why and, you know, make sure that doesn't happen in the future. But unfortunately, I cannot go back and change what has already happened. Yeah. Because I don't know what I'm going to do now to continue car shopping whenever I have these four inquiries now. Well, well, I mean, I'll tell you, it's not going to affect you because if you're buying [DURATION] car, there's no way you can buy [DURATION] car without doing that. That's the thing. I mean, don't let the inquiry part get in your head too much. Until you do that, you're not going to know what you're going to have to do to be able to buy [DURATION] car. You know what I mean? That's why we try to help and we can at least give you direction. Once we send it to the bank and then they tell us yes or no, then we kind of know what's going on. So what was the outcome as far as it looks like you were trying to buy 13 challenger from us, is that right? Right. I believe he said the outcome was I, I didn't want payments over $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. And I. And so he said, he did say he was going to try to help me with that, which I did appreciate, other than me being told that it was going to be one. Everything else was great. But. So he said he was going to try to get me something for [DURATION] way to make the loan. $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. And he said after he ran it that for that to happen, I would either have to put $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down or I would have to have my boyfriend on the loan with me to make it $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. I believe that's how that went. I'm not sure if he meant that if I didn't do those, it wasn't approved or I would have to pay more. I really didn't ask about that part. Okay. Yeah. So, you know, I would be more than happy for us to try to help you any way that we can if you would still want us to. You know, I can try to give you [DURATION] little direction on what you would need to do or maybe what vehicle you possibly need be needing to get that Challenger. Is that kind of the only thing that you would, would be looking for or would you be open to other options. I mean, I'm open to other things, but honestly, I didn't want something with [DURATION] high monthly payment, predominantly because my boyfriend just bought his truck from you guys [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. That's why. That's the whole reason I was even there is I went to turning to go sign papers because my name was also on his old loan that he traded in. And so he has [DURATION] monthly payment of $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] for that truck, which is fine because he's very happy with that. But being that we share, you know, we're [DURATION] family, we have [DURATION] kid and everything, I don't want that much higher of our income going out since his is so high already. That's why I was trying to stick around $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Absolutely. It makes perfect sense. I get it. I have [DURATION] budget myself, so I know how that is. Well, I mean, you know, the best thing I could say, [PERSON_NAME], I mean, like I said, I would be more than happy to try to help you as much as I can into getting you into [DURATION] vehicle. You know, it's something, you know, don't let the inquiry thing get. Get to you too much because I'm telling you, you know, there's no way you're going to spend [DURATION] lot of time. You're going to spend [DURATION] lot of time [DURATION] [DURATION] lot of dealerships if you're not doing that. I hate to say it because if we can't get on the. We can't get with the bank and see, okay, this is what it's going to take to be able to get this person approved. And nobody's ever going to be able to tell you whether they can get you to $[MONEY_AMOUNT] or not. Right. And I understand that. I thought it was one. I was just very shocked when I found out it was four. I do apologize for the miscommunication. But I can promise you one thing. He's like one of our. Actually the top [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] in all of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. So, I mean, I understand. What. He's [DURATION] very nice guy and he. Yeah, I mean, he's [DURATION] very nice guy and he seemed like he was trying to be very helpful and I did appreciate that. I did like him. I was just pissed off today when I saw that on my report. So. Well, I apologize. And you know, if there's anything to help, would you be able to tell me. And see, when he ran my report, he did say that, and it was probably because I just bought [DURATION] house [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. I don't Know if that has anything to do with anything. But I was under the. I thought my score was like [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], but he said when he ran it it was [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], I believe he said. And so that probably affected why I could not get the payments or needed. I don't know if I absolutely had to have [PERSON_NAME] cosign or if he just meant my payments would be higher. Could you. Because once I found out it was going to be more than I thought, I kind of just dropped it at that. But while I have you on the phone, could you enlighten me on what the outcomes kind of was? Yeah. So the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] loan that you have, were you going to be trading that or were you keeping that? Is that the one that we already traded that? We actually. Yeah, you have that far right now. So you guys took over the line, I believe. Yeah. Okay, gotcha. So what it looks like to me from what I'm seeing is you have some credit, you just don't have [DURATION] whole lot. You got some, you know, education loans, stuff like that, but you've only had that one auto. So basically what he was trying to say yesterday is to really strengthen up the approval. Just putting your [MARITAL_STATUS] on there one is going to add income and it looks like he was joint as well, and his score is just [DURATION] little bit higher as well. So what that does in favor for you is that helps get you [DURATION] lower interest rate and also may keep you from having to put, you know, money down possibly too. So that's kind of where he was going with that. So if you put your. If you put your. You said your [MARITAL_STATUS] or your boyfriend. I know he's. He's my boyfriend. Boyfriend. Okay. So if you put your boyfriend on there with you on this one, then that would definitely strengthen your chances of being able to get to that payment that you're wanting. So basically what he was saying is just without him, it would be tough to get your payment to that $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] range without him. Yeah, he did tell me that. I was just kind of wondering. He did tell me that I would need [PERSON_NAME] to be honest to get it to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. He did say that. And he said that the only other option really was if I put down $[MONEY_AMOUNT], which I didn't want to do because [PERSON_NAME] put down [MONEY_AMOUNT] the other day when he was there. Being that I didn't go any further than that with him, I just wanted to ask you if those were my only two options. Like if is what to do. Either of Those things. Well, on this specific vehicle, and the only reason I say that is because the age of it, you know, it's just [DURATION] little bit of an older vehicle. So that cuts us out from [DURATION] lot of different options. And then also we want to make sure we get you with the bank that's going to offer you the best [OCCUPATION] packages. Well, and you know, with that age of vehicle, that only gives us [DURATION] [DURATION] options, and that's the credit unions. And for that vehicle specifically, they were wanting to see either [DURATION] cosign or some money down. Now, if you decided you wanted to go with another vehicle, something maybe [DURATION] little bit newer, lower miles, then we may get it done just in your name. But there again, that would be one of those things where we would have no way of knowing until we did submit it to the banks. So. And I would have to do that all over again, like. Yeah, well, yeah, because we'll see. The way it works is when we just. So you understand the process on our end. So we pull the credit. Okay. When we pull the credit, at that point we have visual access to your, your credit bureau. Okay. We can see your [ORGANIZATION], your [ORGANIZATION], your. We can see all [MONEY_AMOUNT] of those. Okay. The thing is, even though, because I'm going to tell you, if it was up to us, everybody that came in this place, we would be giving them cars left and right. But the thing is, it's not up to us. So what we do is once we pull credit, we take [DURATION] look at the profile, we see what we think and we want to make the best educated decision on, okay, I think this bank will pick up this credit profile, right? And then what has to happen from this point, even though we pulled it, we can't use that for the banks. You know, we, at that point it has to go to the bank so that they can make [DURATION] decision on whether or not they're going to do the loan. So that's okay. I think what I meant by that was like. Yeah, what I think maybe I meant by that was like the banks that. I guess there's four of them, that was already pulled for me, does if I decided on [DURATION] different car there, would you be able to use that pool or would it have to be repeated? Well, no, I mean, we would just have to call the bank and then we would just have to see if the different other vehicle would work and then we know we would not have to repull it. Okay. Now the thing is though, if they don't want to work with you those specific credit unions that was sent to now if they say, hey, this isn't going to work and they still want money down or your boyfriend to go on there with you, then at that point you would just have to make the decision. Okay, do you want us to send it to more banks? There's no guarantee that we can give you when we do that. It's just one of those things to where we try to set you up with the best chance of approval and then once we send it over, we just hope that the bank picks it up and approves. Okay, being that I already have these four run, do you have any other vehicles within that price range that like. And I mean I'm not even there to look, but I, I really just don't want any more hard inquiries. So I don't know if there's anything that I could maybe. Let me look. Does it, does it really matter as far as like what type of vehicle? Like, does it have to be like [DURATION] sporty car? I mean, would you take something more like [DURATION] sedan? It has to. As long as it's something that, I don't know if you met [PERSON_NAME] when he was there. As long as it's something that he, that my boyfriend would drive. Because I will be driving his truck to work and he would be driving that vehicle to work because he worked further away. That's why I was just trying to get something that he would also like. Right, Let me see. So realistically we need to have you on something under $[MONEY_AMOUNT] to get you to that, that payment budget. We have [DURATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] 1 Series 135i, it's 125 and it's actually [DURATION] really nice car. It's [DURATION] two door convertibles. So I don't, you know, the Challenger's two door, this one's manual. I don't know if you'd be able to do [DURATION] manual or not, but it's [DURATION] super nice little car and it's sporty and it's cheap. Age is [DURATION] little old, but the mileage is [DURATION] little less. I mean that may be one that might work, you know, if we're going to go something older. But you know, then we have like [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Sonic. We have [DURATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Compass. We have [DURATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Journey. I mean we got [DURATION] lot of options. It's just really gonna come down to which one's gonna be, you know, basically what you're, what you're needing for your day to day. Okay. The other vehicles you were speaking of do you know the range of mileage on those? Because I know that the, I know that the vehicle I looked at yesterday had [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles on it, which is kind of [DURATION] lot. Yeah, these are all less than that. And that's what's making it [DURATION] little difficult for you as far as getting you approved because of the mileage. Mileage in the [DURATION]. But every one of these that I mentioned has no more than, no more than 120,000 miles. And that's really where you need to be looking at. And the newer the better too. But I mean, you know, that's going to be up to you. Like the [ORGANIZATION] Patriots, those are nice. That [DATE_INTERVAL] Patriot we have is 11.5. It's only got 111,000 miles on it. [ORGANIZATION] Patriot is more of the squared off. It's [DURATION] smaller [ORGANIZATION] kind of [DURATION] squared off body style. It doesn't look like [DURATION] Liberty, does it? Kind of does look like [DURATION] Liberty to [DURATION] degree. It's. If you pull up our website and then also too if you want me to, I can have younger, you know, send pictures or I mean you, you're probably going to get better pictures from what we have online. But you can look it up. I mean it's [DURATION] good looking, [DURATION] silver in color. I mean, would I be on your website? Yeah, just go to our website and take [DURATION] look. And what I would do, the best way I would look at it this way, you definitely want to be under [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then you don't want to exceed $[MONEY_AMOUNT] in price. Okay. So what I would do is I would go on to our website and then I would sort price low to high and then go through it like that and then you're going to find those vehicles. The newer the [DURATION] the better. But you know, just whatever you find, just save it and then you can call me back or [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] will probably be able to tell you [DURATION] little bit more because she'll actually go out to the car and she can take pictures and all that good stuff for you and then we can. Your name go from there. Yeah, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And so you do think with what he pulled yesterday I could possibly just get [DURATION] different car with one of those places? It's possible. Like I said, I really can't tell you for sure because the problem is with the vehicle that it was on, it just kind of got declined immediately. And then they put comments basically telling us, hey, this to make this work, that she's going to need this or this. So, you know, we haven't really ventured into that yet. Just because we were kind of waiting to see what. What you were wanting to do. Yeah, I was just like, if there's [DURATION] way to. Where you guys could ask the same places again without me having another pull from those. Absolutely can. That would be good since it's already done. But I mean, yesterday I came home and talked to [PERSON_NAME] about it and he just was gonna. He thought maybe about just putting the car in his name because it was. Whenever we had [DURATION] car we've in both of our names, it seemed like it created more of [DURATION] problem whenever we try to get other loans. It was weird. So I was just iffy about. Well, I mean, that's [DURATION] possibility too. And then, you know, one way I can tell you that [DURATION] lot of people do it, you know, he could always refinance the vehicle and get it put in your name. So, I mean, that would be your choice. But I mean, it's going to be for both of you technically. So really it's just going to depend. I didn't do the deal with your boyfriend, so I don't know what his income looks like. You may want to be on it just because of income purposes, but I think you make like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, all right. And I make like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, I mean, we can, we could look into, I mean, here. Okay, so here's how we go about it. Okay? You find [DURATION] vehicle you like online, maybe give us [DURATION] [DURATION] options, maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] different ones. That way if one, for some reason doesn't really work too well with the bank, then we can say, okay, let's try the other one. And then what we can do is we can call the bank and then all we gotta do is just swap out the collateral from what was on it previously. And [DURATION] lot of times they can do that over the phone and then we don't have to submit it back over to them and then they can see internally if it's something that they can do or not. And if it is, then they'll say, yep, it is, and they will approve it and just, you know, send it to us. Then we won't have to, you know, send it back to them. And then if it doesn't, then we can call you and say, hey, this is what they're saying. This would probably be [DURATION] good time to either put him on there with you, or we can try it just with him buying the vehicle in just his name. Alright. I just didn't know if it was going to negatively impact his credit [DURATION] lot if he had so much money tied up in car loans. Well, I mean, it will affect his debt to income. I'm not going to lie to you there. It will affect his debt to income, but at the same time, I mean, you know, as long as he don't plan on buying any more cars after that for [DURATION] little bit, then, I mean, you know, or anything, any big purchase like that, then it's not really going to matter. Mm. So. But, you know, that would be totally your choice on that end. Okay. All right, I will look at the website. I appreciate you speaking with me. Yeah, absolutely. And I apologize again. And anything else that I can do for you, please do let me know. Okay. Okay. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. All right, thank you. Bye.

Do you want me to send you some Tacomas through X Or do you just want to come down and start looking at some. Well, that's hard for me to get around. I don't drive much. That's why I don't have no mileage on the truck. But I [INJURY] [INJURY] [INJURY] in [DATE_INTERVAL] over at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Oh man, I hate to hear that but it's ruined my life. But you know, I need something I can drive. But I hardly ever drive. Yeah. Tell me how I can help you. Well, can we make a trade? If we can get a. Make a deal on what is Absolutely, absolutely what I've got to choose from and y' all get my truck. Okay, let's do this. You want to let me. I don't mean to cut you off. [PERSON_NAME], I do apologize. Let me do this. Let me. I'm gonna. I want to shoot you a text. That way you've got my cell phone number. Yeah. And then what we can do. That way you don't have to come out here. I'm gonna find some stuff online and send it to you and then you tell me which truck works best for you and I can get all the numbers put together. So that way you only have to come down here once. Yeah, well, I'd have to get my son to take off from work and come with me. He works in [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Yeah, well, [PERSON_NAME], I can. And you know, worst case. Worst case scenario, we can. We can have somebody come pick you up or send a lift to come pick you up.

I've got everything from SR5 to TRD off roads. Can you send me some pictures of your truck? That way I can kind of get a trade appraisal together for you. Well, it'd be Sunday when my son come, I get him to send it. Oh, okay. Listen, whatever works best for you. Okay. Well, my truck is black. I bought it over there. So I don't know if y' all got any records or what, but. Well, the only records we would have is your service history. Yeah. And I'm pretty sure, I mean, if it's only got 56,000 miles on it, it sounds like you take care of it. We're not worried about that. Yeah, no, the truck is in perfect good shape. It's in the carport out of the weather, too. It's got new tires on it. No. Yeah. It sounds to me like you've taken care of it. Yeah. Are you going to be financing? Because I know the trade's going to be worth something, but then the remainder. Are you going to finance the remainder or are you just going to pay cash? Well, that's what. I didn't know what mine is worth and what what you got cost. Well, let's do this. I've got. Do you have to have a 4x4 truck or. Well, it don't have to be, but I used to see some when I was over there looking that by mine. You had some with winches even in the back. With what in the back? A winch in the back of the bed. Oh. Oh, yeah. I don't. I don't think I have any with a winch in the back of the bed. Well, I think I can't. I be hardly ever use it anyway. But I'm limited on what I can do. But I don't need this size truck no more. And I thought, well, okay, you know, I know I can sell it, but I'm not advertised to nobody. Matter of fact, you're the first one I've even Told are going to sell it. Okay, well, let's do this. Let me get some numbers together for you. That way you at least know roundabout what your trade is worth and then we can go from there. What I'll do is I'll just, I'll send you a few options and then you can tell me what you think as far as price and all that goes. Well, I have no idea. I have no idea what mine's worth. We can, we can, we can sort that out. Okay, I'll work on that for you. Okay. Okay. But I just know it's in perfect shape. I believe you. I believe you. It's only got [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it. Yeah, I believe that. But I just thinking, you know, if I could get something small that I can, you know, operate better, then, you know, maybe I can work something out that, you know, I've come out better off. But, you know. Yeah, but I thought, well, I don't need a new one if I just got one. He's got low mileage on it in good shape. So I've always dealt with y' all, so I thought, well, I'll call back. Well, we appreciate it. We want you to, we want you to continue to deal with us. Well, well, you can send me some pictures. You want my email address? Well, I've got. Yeah, you already got it. Okay. And then what do I just want to send them to your. I'm going to send them to your cell phone. Okay. And then that way you can just open the pictures right up on the cell phone. Okay. Okay. And then I've got your house number so that way I can get a hold of you. If I can't get a hold of you on your cell phone. Yeah, well, yeah, I know. Sunday I get my son to take a picture and send to you. He'll be here Sunday.

"Thank you for calling for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME] [ORGANIZATION] calling. I'm actually calling about a car I found on your website. How can I help? Looks like it is a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Escape. What's the. I'm trying to see an identifier on here. Check on the car guru. Yeah, it's a [ORGANIZATION] Escape. Yep. Okay. Silver. Yep, yep. Let me just double check to make sure this is available as our inventory does go quickly. Where are you calling from? [LOCATION]. [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Oh, okay. How's you guys have the beautiful weather out there today like we do down here? Oh yeah. Yep. Yeah. Pretty nice out. We need some rain. I know that. I know my sprinkler. So I live in [LOCATION] and they require us to put these rain meters on our irrigation system. And so what it does basically is if it's dry, the sprinkler goes off. But if the little cup is full, it doesn't go off and my irrigation system is going off non stop because it's so dry. I know. Expensive water bill, I'm sure. Yeah. To my records, this [ORGANIZATION] Escape is available. What other questions did you have and did you want to set some time up today to come take a look at it? Well, I don't know. I know you guys are a [ORGANIZATION] dealership, but just kind of wondering what kind of features this one has. It looks like it. I mean it looks like it's relatively well equipped, huh? It does. So the main features that this one. So the [ORGANIZATION] Sync I think is what it's called when you purchase a [ORGANIZATION]. You register through the [ORGANIZATION] Sync and then you have remote start through the phone. So this doesn't actually have the remote start on the key fob. Gotcha. All wheel drive, I believe this one is. Let me make sure you have all wheel drive. It comes with our nice care. It's a dealership warranty. So the brakes, batteries, bulbs, belts and hoses are covered for [DURATION] [DURATION]. 12,000 miles. Also known as the wearables. Right. So kind of peace of mind coverage on purchasing a vehicle at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. What kind of financing do you guys offer? Or don't you offer financing? No, we do. It's really. I just quote average rate, average terms. Is there a trade in. Is there money down? You know, is there all things that are loan factors and stuff like that. So I mean, we don't have a trade. This vehicle would actually be for my daughter, she's a new driver, so we wouldn't be trading anything. I could put down, you know what, whatever would Give us the best rate. My [MARITAL_STATUS] and I both have credit scores that are in the 800 so. So I'll get you prime rates. That's. That's no problem. Before we put the cart before the horse, I just want to make sure you like the vehicle. Right. So it is a non smoker. I took it in on trade from an elderly couple. They traded this in for a [ORGANIZATION] Escape or a [ORGANIZATION] Equinox. Oh my gosh. Where's the top this morning? No, I gotcha. Yeah, I mean it seems like a nice, a nice car. I don't. I. Not really was kind of looking at [ORGANIZATION] as well, but this one just happened to pop up as appears to be a decent deal. Yeah. Did you want to schedule today? You think I'd have to talk to my, to my [MARITAL_STATUS] close at [TIME] Yeah. I mean I'm assuming this is your. And also this is your no haggle price. I'm assuming as well, most of this stuff is correct. Yep. That is our friendly best price. Yep. Okay. Is there anything that you're aware of that any major scratches or dents or anything like that in it? I would walk around it again when I took it to [ORGANIZATION], I didn't notice anything, you know, as if I was selling it to a family of mine and I would take a double check on it and then I can give you a call back if that's all right. I guess the only other thing before I would come down and take a look. I'd like to know again kind of what approximate, you know, finance rates are. Like I said, if I, if we come down and everything checks out, this is something that I'm probably make the trip down. I'm probably buying it, so. Great. Yeah, I mean I'm confident we can find a solution for the rate. You know, I have 30 different lenders, you know, so for me to say, oh it's a [MONEY_AMOUNT] or a [MONEY_AMOUNT] or an [MONEY_AMOUNT] or. I mean that'd be doing a disservice for you. Right. Because I know you got great credit. But again it's one of those things of I don't know until I submit it over to the lenders. Right. Okay. Okay. Let me maybe go walk around the car and give me a call back. Let me know. You know, I think there's some pretty good pictures online here, but. Hey [PERSON_NAME].

Were you out of state or were you here in [LOCATION]? No, I'm asking. Okay. And I asked because we can always send you total price. We do offer shipping. If it's something that you consider, we can always price it out and secure it for you. If everything looks good to you. Well, I was just trying to find out what. I mean, buyback. It's a buyback car, right? Yes, it is. Which to me means that it was a lemon. And you know, I wanted to try to figure out what was wrong with it and you know, has it been fixed? Yes, it's a buyback from the to the manufacturer. So the manufacturer bought it back fixed it under the warranty that the vehicle was under to begin with. So. So, yes, all the issues were fixed. That's why it's now available to sell on our end. We simply just acquired the vehicle. So we're just checking all the services that are pending. I can send you the report if it helps if you still, you know, if you're still interested even after the report, we can then again send you more information. But I have the report. It looks like there was the fuel pump that was replaced for concerns and that remedied the issue. So that's pretty much the only finding. Okay, well, yeah, I'd like to see that report because, you know, I am still interested in the vehicle. I wish you had it there because right now I have time off next [DURATION]. I'm kind of, you know, busy. Okay. Yeah, I should be arriving. I mean, I can always see if there's already, like, a specific date, but typically it takes about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. But in the meantime, I can send you the report if it happens to arrive sooner. And it's sometime around this [DURATION]. We would let you know. What is your email where I can send you the report? Okay, perfect. So I will send you that report. My information will be listed on there as well in case you have any questions. And then also check ETA and see if there's already a date that is available for delivery. Okay. Any other questions that I can assist you with? I actually, I'm curious as to how they got a buyback on a car with 70,000 miles. Correct. [LOCATION] has, you know, regulations. It's a lot easier to report anything wrong based on their law out there. There's more leniency to report anything under the buyback. So I don't know if there might have been a history of concerns that were filed and Let me just take a look. And there's a big possibility that when the issues were addressed, it would have been just as the warranty was expiring. Okay, well, do you have the Carfax also? Yeah, I'll send it to you. Okay. All right. Well, okay, I'll take a look at that and see if hopefully you can get it in this [DURATION]. Okay. Because I'm actually quite far away, but, you know, I just fly there and, you know, drive home. Okay, no problem. Then I'll. I will send you the report. Okay, thank you very much. What was your name?

Actually I had a couple of questions for you if you don't mind if I rattle off a couple of questions here. Just curious. When you guys take in the vehicles, do you guys perform a service check or inspection of the car? Absolutely, absolutely. It's a full inspection. And when you will be here, if you will be here, you will get this inspection report. Absolutely. Okay. If something like tires and brakes come up on that, you guys replace that or is that just something that's part of. Let me double check. Let me go to our recondition. [VEHICLE_ID]. Let's go my report print. Let's see what we did. Mechanical inspection, tires and brakes was. Hold on. The [PERSON_NAME] wiper blades, air filter, cabin filter, engine oil, synthetic detail, smog, brakes and tires past inspection. We didn't need to. Everything is in green. We didn't need to to put the new one. Everything was in absolute normal condition. Awesome. Perfect. And I think I checked the car fact but obviously the the car has a clean title, right? Not branded or salvaged. Let me click on the Carfox. No accident or damage reported. It's a clean title. Yes sir. Okay, perfect. And through your dealership for used cars, do you guys offer any warranties out of the box or any warranties that could be purchased with the car? Yes, yes. It depends on a car. Absolutely. You can add extended warranty, you can add maintenance, you can add a lot of things. When you'll be here and if you will be. When you will be in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] or [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] will tell you exactly what is available on this car, what you can get and how Much it cost. And you will make an educated decision. Gotcha. Okay, next one. Do you happen to know for maybe like the holiday weekend? Are you guys doing any financing specials? If I was to finance not on a used car, but based on your credit. Absolutely. We can get you to few banks that we are working with and get you the best the best apr they offer right now. But again it will be based on your credit, based on your score, based on your financial situation. We're not selling you money, we're not the bank, we're not going to be your lien holder. But we can help you to get the best approval. Absolutely. Okay, that is good to know. And then final person, my first name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And last name is [PERSON_NAME].

These [ORGANIZATION] cars, there's nothing here in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. So it does look like I'll have to travel. So if I can make a decision and potentially put a deposit down. I'm looking at your guys car and then there's a car in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] and then a car in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. Really would like to make a decision today and then fly out. Buy a plane ticket tonight and then fly out to the location tomorrow. And probably. Okay. If you will be flying out tomorrow in here. We're working tomorrow [TIME] to [TIME] and I'm not here tomorrow. It's another [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], his name is [PERSON_NAME].

Let me know when you will be available and we will take it from there. Okay, [PERSON_NAME], one last question for you. Do you guys offer putting deposits down on cars to put them on hold? Yes and no. Usually we're going to hold the car for you if you will give us a deposit. Let's take $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. But we know that you on the way. We cannot just take a deposit on the car and hold it for you. And after this you will give us a call, let's say tomorrow and tell us. Ah, guys, sorry. I decided I'm going to go buy [ORGANIZATION]. And we for kind of lost all the opportunities to sell the car. We most likely will be able to hold it for you if we know that we agree on the price, that we agree on everything. You go to buy the car, you give us $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit and you are on the way. This is the only way that we can hold it for you. I cannot just hold the car for you just because until you'll make a decision for sure. No, that's fair enough. Okay, that, that makes sense.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON_NAME], how can I help you? Yes, hi, I'm not sure who I need to speak to. I want to see if I could arrange an appointment to buy out a lease vehicle. So it sounds like [ORGANIZATION] can't do it, or [ORGANIZATION] can't do it through the financial company. You have to go into the dealership to do it. So. Okay, hold tight one sec. [PERSON_NAME], can you. Yes, hi, I was calling because I'm looking to come in to make the appointment to buy out a lease that I have and it sounds like the financial company doesn't allow you to do it. You have to go into the dealership. If the was what I saw for [LOCATION], but it's. I'm used to being able just to send the check in and get the title and all that kind of stuff. But they said we have to go to the [OCCUPATION]. I don't know if that's correct or not. Okay, I believe they have sent you to the wrong extension. I'm in scheduling for our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Believe you'll need to go to our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Let me transfer you. Okay, thanks. One moment. [PERSON_NAME]. Hello, this train. Yes, I was calling to see about making an appointment to come in. I wanted to purchase my leased vehicle and. Okay, my interest, my understanding was I can't just send the check into them, they make you go into the dealership. So if that's the case, then I want to make an appointment. Yeah, unfortunately you can. A lot of people are like, I'm just going to pay [ORGANIZATION] directly and just mail them a check. But [ORGANIZATION] makes you go to a [OCCUPATION]. Yep. Awesome. What, what time and what [DURATION] would you like to come in? I'll set everything up for you. So it would be great if we could do Thursday afternoon. Thursday afternoon. Okay. And then do you know what time? Around [TIME] from [TIME]. Yeah, [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] would be great. Yeah, [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] Would be great. We're free. Okay, and then what's your name? So the name is [PERSON_NAME] and last name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. So this is for my, my mother in law purchase. Well, my mother in law has a leased [ORGANIZATION] Trax and she's gonna be buying it out. But my [MARITAL_STATUS] has power of [OCCUPATION], so we're coming in to finalize and the registrations in her name. Her [MARITAL_STATUS] had passed away and so she has the car registered all in her name now and everything like that. So now we're just gonna buy out the lease. Okay, no problem. And then what's a good phone number for you guys? Okay. Cool. All right. Yeah, I'll put that for you. So do you need, do you need a, do we need a [OCCUPATION] check that [DURATION]? Which, like should we call to find out what the payoff is and have a check made out that [DURATION] or how does that work? You just do a personal check. That's easier. So when you guys get here, you put everything in the system, call [ORGANIZATION], which takes a little bit or see if I can pull it. And then once I get [ORGANIZATION] to get me the exact payoff, I can tell you guys like everything. And then you guys can just write a personal check if you guys like. And then that should be it. That's perfect. And then so is that for [TIME] or [TIME] on Thursday? I put [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] on Thursday. Okay, that's good. Yeah. Tomorrow's the last [DURATION] [DATE] [DATE] [DURATION]. Obviously we'd like to do it like today or tomorrow. But if you can make it on Thursday, that's fine. We can, we can do it the [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DURATION]. That's no problem. I definitely. Yeah, today or tomorrow. I can't, I can't. Unfortunately I can't do. My [MARITAL_STATUS] not. Won't be home until after [TIME], [TIME], [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] tonight and then tomorrow. I know she's taking my mama modest and [OCCUPATION] appointments. Okay, no problem. And then you guys live locally in [LOCATION]. [LOCATION] or [LOCATION] area? Yeah. Okay. Yes. All right. And then. So who am I asking for when I come in? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Great. And one last thing. What's your zip code? I'm sorry? Well, my zip code is [LOCATION]. Okay. Yeah, you can ask for me. I'm gonna put the appointment in here. Now whenever you get here, I need to take a picture [DATE] [DATE] VIN number and miles to put it in the system and then contact [ORGANIZATION] and see get the payoff. And then there's just a few preliminary paperwork and then you just go to [ORGANIZATION] and hand them the check and then they send it to [ORGANIZATION]. So it's pretty quick overall. Okay. All right, that sounds, that sounds good. Is there any. I'm just out of curiosity. So after my. So my mother in law is going to be selling or transferring. After she buys it out, she's going to be giving it to my, to my daughter. So I'm just wondering if there's a way now when we buy it out, just have it in her name or our name or does it have to go bought out to her first and then we do that separately. I think I can try to transfer it here. But I think the easiest way would be just when you guys personally, since you have the power of [OCCUPATION], since you. It'll be for you guys to buy it and then as soon as everything's in your name, give it like [DURATION] [DURATION] or once everything clears and finalizes, then all you have to do is just put the title in her name or switch the registration her name. I think that would be the easiest way for you guys. Okay. All right, very good. Thanks, [PERSON_NAME]. I appreciate it. I'll say for sure. Okay. Yeah, I'll see you guys on Thursday. If you need anything, call me back here at this line and then my name is [PERSON_NAME]. Or if you need me to text you, I can for my cell phone. But I'll put the appointment in and we'll have everything squared away on Thursday. Sounds great. All right, Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME].

I mean he's kind of been looking at a lot of the Toyotas, but I'm not sure. We were just trying to see our options. But what kind of incentives do you have on the Edge right now? On the edge? Let me double check because we do have 22 edges in stock. We haven't received any 23 shifts yet. But I'm pretty sure we do have incentives going on for them. Tell you what, what is a good callback number so I can give you a call back? Let me verify with my [OCCUPATION] and if I could give you a call back, would that be okay? Yeah. Do you have also any like certified [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]? I mean are you just. I mean we're kind of looking for options whether we want new or used. And I mean I was wanting to get the best deal possible because I know this is the last day of the [DURATION]. Correct. And I really, you know, hoping to get right now. I haven't had a card over [DURATION] [DURATION] because I had a wreck in [DATE_INTERVAL] so I had no training. Oh goodness. Okay. So yeah, people don't care to really deal with. I mean they were just really interested in that trade in and you know, I'll come out be honest. I don't have a trade in and I'm not desperate for a car, I mean because my [MARITAL_STATUS] are sharing right now. But at the same time I would like to, I just want to try and get the best deal possible. Cars are overpriced, ma' Am I understand. So from what I. Go ahead. Oh yeah, go ahead. So from what I can see at a quick glance it looks like I do have a couple certified [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] edges. If you were going for an edge, but I know that I have a lot of certified [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] vehicles. It's just a matter of narrowing down to what exactly you're looking for. But it'd be best having you here in the store. That way we can narrow down if an edge is what you're looking for. If you're looking for new or [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and we can just go from there. Okay, and what is your name? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Yeah, like I said, we couldn't come in until after my [MARITAL_STATUS] gets off of work and stuff. Like I mean I'm off today. But as far as, I mean do you have incentives on the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]? On the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], I don't believe so. I'm in the new department so I would need to double check with the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] regarding incentives on [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] vehicles. Yeah, I'd like to know because I mean I don't want to go there and be disappointed that I mean, because I mean this is end of the [DURATION] and a lot of dealerships do try to, you know, give the customers many incentives, you know, to get a good sale. So that's why I'm calling because you know, just hoping that they're willing to, you know, give us as many incentives as possible so we just worth our time to come out and see what they just, you know, want to. I mean, like I said, I mean I'm open to escape but I don't know at this point if I want anything brand new because you know, I'm in close to [OCCUPATION] and insurance would cost a lot money, you know, on something newer. But you know, just trying to weigh my options. I know you're a new [OCCUPATION] but if you could, I don't know, if you find out anything, let me know. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. You can just leave a voicemail if I don't answer. But you know, just you know whether any type of incentives new or used. If you could just kind of give me a heads up on that. Yes ma' am. What is a good callback number for you? I may not answer. I may be in a meeting or something. But yeah, like you can just leave a voicemail. But thank you. Like I said, I just, I want to catch you all because in the end of the [DURATION]. Correct. What is your last name, [PERSON_NAME]? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] okay. All right, let me find out on incentives for. Are you looking for an edge or an escape? Well, whatever. Either. I mean, yeah, okay. I mean. Okay. Well, thank you for your help. No, thank you. Let me check, and then I will give you a call. And that way we can set up a good time for you to come. Come in this afternoon. All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye.",failure,general_inquiry,unknown,medium,False,0bbc841d2e274b0b944972e774337c35_transcript.json

It is still here. There's currently a deposit, but I don't know if it's gonna go. Oh, okay. Do you do the trade ins as well? We do the trade ins, yes. Yeah, I have a car that I would have to bring in a. I have a wrangler that I like to trade in and get the G wagon. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] Wrangler black. I have it with all the extras and leather seats and like the really big tires on it and everything else. It's up in my house. But I would have to go and get it, bring it down to. I'm in [LOCATION], but I'm. I have a house upstate. So I would have to go and get it, bring it down and replace it with the G Wagon. So, I mean, I just like to kind of get a price on it. But if you already have a deposit on it, maybe I have to wait till you guys know if it's sold. Yeah, let me. I'll take your info. I don't know if. I don't. I don't think the car is going to go, but that's just my personal opinion. But I can give you a call tomorrow to get a better idea. Yeah, that would be great. My cell phone. Your name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. May I ask a quick question? On the G Wagon, it says somewhere on here, I don't know, my thing on my app, that they had an accident. I don't have the Carfax. Is it. So what kind of accident was it, the car? Well, I mean, you could see it. So it. It like the front, right. It taught. It hit a car, but it wasn't significant damage. The grill, you know the grill that comes with it, that metal piece, it shifted and they never fixed it, so that's what it was. Also in the front, there's something Wrong with the car? Yeah, yeah. No, like that silver piece, that grill, whatever shifted it slightly. Like you wouldn't even notice it until you actually look at it. Like really look at it. And that is what happens. But the actual car, the. The G wagon didn't get hit because it's very, you know, a G wagon, like tanks. It's very hard for something to like, get out of the way of a G wagon as far as the damage. Right. And then. And then a quick one on the. Do you guys do like a checkup on the car? Because they have so many G wagons for sale, you know. But I kind of feel like the car like this you should probably buy at a reputable [OCCUPATION] like you guys. Which is different than buying it like in [LOCATION], you know, at some, you know, place. No, it's gone through the shop, the whole nine yards. He put new tires. Tires on it. I just went over this with someone else. There's new tires, oil change, filter. I think that's it. That was done. Okay. Okay. As everything new, I. I have a. Normally out in the [LOCATION] and it's. It's basically, you know, my. My kind of beach car part there. And that one has. I gotta tell you, it's been probably the car that for the most money in all of cars is the Wrangler. The problem is a manual black. Got it. The beauty. It really is. But my, my [MARITAL_STATUS] can't drive it and she's mainly up there, so she can't drive it because she can't drive a stick shift. So I have to get another car. Yeah, yeah. I mean, this, this, this one was out in the [LOCATION]. That's where this mainly was. Yeah. You know, so it's. It's a perfect car for out there because, you know, these are not real like a Wranglers. They're not like real highway driving cars. They're like perfect for like local driving. Yeah, that's right. I mean, is the. Do you know the name of the previous owner? Because my friend had the exact same car out there, so maybe it's not. I think it. This one was traded in on. At our. On a [ORGANIZATION] side, I think, or on the [ORGANIZATION] side. I forget. Yeah, that sounds about right about my friend. Yeah. So he probably let me double check with him. Maybe it's this car. But. So I think it's great. And you're saying it's in mint condition besides the grill and the front. The front windshield? Because it's by the water out east. Like you could see like some of the paint very small, but you'll see it like, you know, like with salt water. Like just stuff. Like it's on the paint, but it's. It's fixed, if that makes sense. Around the windshield. So it's already sealed, but other than that, it's perfectly fine. Drives fine. I was literally on a test drive in it last week. So there's nothing wrong with the car cosmetically, I mean, internally. But other than that, how do I get. How do I get a quote on my trade in? Because that's important to me, like what I'm gonna get. You know, what's the price difference? What. I'm paying taxes on all of that. Right. All right, so what I'll do. Number. Yeah, yeah. When I get in tomorrow and I have a better idea of what they're gonna do with this with the client with a deposit, I'll shoot you a text. You can send me your all everything on the Jeep and then we'll go from there. Okay, perfect. Let's do that. Let's do that. And I would, I would. Then if the guy doesn't buy it, the other guy doesn't buy it. I would probably buy then next week. Okay. Made up my mind. So, you know, I have a lot of cars, so for me this is not like a big deal. So I would love to, love to get to a good price and then have a. Do a swap over next week so I can have it for the summer would be great. Got it, got it, got it. Quick one. Do you know, like, the G wagons, are there like a lot of maintenance on them? I mean, this one is not that old. Then [DATE_INTERVAL] is really on the car like this. Not that old. Right, but. And it's only 50,000 miles. Like 100,000 miles. Yeah. I mean, these are, you know, G wagons have been around forever. So these are. These are simple [DURATION] [DURATION] typical maintenance that you need. What's the cost? I don't know. That I do not know. But it sounds like this is just going to be your house because this is going to be your car just for outdoors. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. All right. What's your name? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. What's your name? Sorry? [PERSON_NAME]. Cool. [PERSON_NAME]. So you got my cell phone number? [PERSON_NAME]? Yeah. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. Okay, [PERSON_NAME], you got my cell phone number. Tomorrow shoot me an email. I'll send you the VIN number. I'll send you the. You can also send it me now a text. I can send it over to you. VIN number, a few pictures of the car and then you. You tell me what you guys think, and then, you know, we can talk. Hopefully we can get a deal done if the car doesn't sell. Okay, no problem.

I haven't been able to check how many cars they are. But there is a car there. I was just looking online and unfortunately it's in the [ORGANIZATION] side. I think I can. You want me to text you the reference and if you get a chance, you can check it out and see. Is that cool? Let me give you the stock number with you right now. Excuse me. Got the stock number with you right now or what kind of car? Yeah, yeah, it's actually a [ORGANIZATION]. I've been looking for something below [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And this is a [ORGANIZATION] Sonata. No, it's not a Sonata. Hold on. Is it red? Yeah. Not [DATE_INTERVAL]. [ORGANIZATION] Elantra SE. And I have the. I have all the information here. The bin number and everything. It's a gray color. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's going for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right. Is that the one that you're interested? Go ahead and take a video of it and then send it right over to you. I'm. I'm looking at the pictures here. I'm here online and I see it did have an accident. It says in mile accident. Yeah, it's got mile accident. Take a look and see. What was that? It was a sideswipe collision. So which lanes? And then someone switched lanes and then they hit each other and they met into one lane. So someone was switching lanes. The guy in a sideswipe. Any possibility of going down in the price or at least on the fees A little bit. I mean, the prices that are online, those are based on the carfax as well. So it's probably not much. I mean, there's room to play, but it's not going to be a lot to play with because we price our vehicles according to how well they're maintained and their history on the carfax. That's the thing. But I could go ahead and try to speak to my [OCCUPATION] and see if we can get something going and see what's the price that we have on that car. I'll see, but I can't promise you anything, to be honest. Yeah, I understand that. Yeah. All right, you can do that and take a video of it and I'll let one of the [OCCUPATION] know and See what we're looking at. And then we also have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Elantra. It's a hatchback. It's a GT. It's a little bit cheaper, you know, so you'll definitely be around that price range. We're asking [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it. It's only got [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh, really? Yeah, [MONEY_AMOUNT], 85,000 miles. But, you know, it's [DATE_INTERVAL], so that's not a lot of miles for, you know, that old of a car, but I could probably work out. So this one. This one, the miles are low, lower. It's like, I think I saw like 35, 000, right? Yeah, like 35, 000 miles on this one. Yeah, that one's got 30 miles. And then the red one has [MONEY_AMOUNT], but also has no accidents reported on the carfax. So you're looking at a cleaner carfax, you know. I see. Okay. You know, at the same time, they're both around your price range too. So what I could do is I could go ahead, I want to take videos of both cars. I'm gonna email you the link to those videos. You can take a look at it. That way you have a better personal view of the walkthroughs, and then just give me a call back, let me know which one you're interested in. Now, set an appointment for you to come here, you know, take a better look at it in person. Okay. Okay. So the videos will be inside, because I can see here online. I can see the outside. But you're gonna make a video inside, right? Yes, I'm gonna take a video of the whole car inside, outside. I'm gonna show you the motor. I'm gonna show you the trunk, everything. I'm gonna give you a full through walkthrough. Okay. And then when you come here, you know, we'll just give you another walk through that we have a, you know, you can see in person. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate all your time. All right, no problem. Is this the best. I know you gave me a call, but this is not the best 1 number to call you. You gave me another car with another number. Right. If you. Whenever you get a chance, if you can send 4 number that's on that card that I gave you. That's my personal number. You could text me and call me anytime, you know, but the number that you just called, this leads to our dealership, which I'm also available to whenever I'm working. Oh, okay. All right, that's.

Or you could do a [ORGANIZATION] terrain that's going to be bigger and it's going to be. Them are going to be [TIME] [TIME] start. Start around 30 and go. Can go to, say, 40, but that's an option. They're a nice vehicle, too. [ORGANIZATION] Terrain, I have no problem with, you know, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] at all. I've owned them [TIME] [TIME] past. Yes, sir. So it would be nice to have something a little bit bigger than a [ORGANIZATION] Civic. Yes, sir. No, I highly recommend in that budget, maybe a Terrain. A [ORGANIZATION] Terrain. I got some good savings on them right now, and I've got a big selection right now, so it's a good time. And, hey, it didn't hit our dealership, man. I was worried about it. I thought, my house, now it's going to hit all my cars. Then what? You know, but it didn't hit. It went through [LOCATION], and that was. It didn't touch [ORGANIZATION]. Well, I work for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. It's all right for them. It's my retirement job. Oh, nice. I know exactly how this works. I would do [DURATION] [DURATION] [TIME] [TIME] claims industry with the insurance company. Oh, yes, sir. I know what you're going through. I know what I'm going to go through. And, you know, way there. Yeah. Yep, yep. And I got a feeling they're going to total your vehicle. I just got that feeling due to age of the vehicle. I got a feeling they're gonna. They're gonna, you know, especially if they got hit. I mean, hard, you know, especially the top when they got to start dropping the. The. The headliners down and off. That gets very expensive. And if it's a lot of dings on that hood, they could replace hoods. You start replacing parts and Hoods and man, it really starts adding up. So. Oh, it's on a quarter, it's on the, the riser, it's on all the trim. The windshield is cracked in five places but still in place. I can still drive. Yes. Not taking it down the highway, but you know, local. Yeah, well, my, it hit on the passenger side. I had a big one hit because it cracked pretty good. But it. One more hit and I think it would have busted in because if you, if you're [TIME] [TIME] inside of the vehicle and you start rubbing against there, you feel it's rough, the glass, it's just about ready to cave in. So I'm gonna get that fixed pretty quick because it's just a safety issue to me. Big time. Yes, sir. Go in on Friday. Yes sir. I'm trying to see what would be a good time to come out and visit with you. Of course, absolutely. Preliminary. Preliminary, but. Oh, I'd like something lined up ready to go. Yes sir. Because I got a feeling just on the age of the vehicle and all. Just pure age of the vehicle and the damage. I got a feeling they're going to go ahead and just write you a check. But I could be wrong. I could be wrong. But I know it's expensive when you start all this hail damage because there's a lot that we see and there's going to be a lot that you don't even notice. Yeah. That you know, the experts are putting under life. I'm in denial. But you're right. I know that that's what's going to happen. Yes, sir. Pay it off. Yes, sir. Nice little vehicle. Yes, sir. Absolutely. I, I put my two kids when their first vehicle, put them in [ORGANIZATION] Civics. Absolutely. When they first started driving good little cars. But hey, I've got you covered. You just let me know a time. Typically on Fridays I'm here from like [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] till [TIME], [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. Just let me know what time and I can.

Like I said, gas will most likely be. It's not like my [DURATION] [DURATION] wait for my Rivian. Oh, wow, and you waited that long for it? Yeah, I waited that long for it to place the deposit. [DURATION] [DURATION] before it got almost on the almost. I think maybe, you know, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] or so round it up. Oh wow.

Yeah, Yeah, I will. I'll get you like a price quote sent over to you. Excellent. Excellent. Yeah, so it'll probably have. It'll probably have the price of the vehicle. There might be a market adjustment on there. And then we have a VIP package, kind of a warranty that comes with all of our vehicles and that might be on there also. But I can get that sent over to you, sir. Not a problem. Yeah.

I mean, I'm planning to, you know, get a code, a pre approval from one of the banks, but I Just wanted to know. I've heard anywhere from. I've heard anywhere from like [MONEY_AMOUNT] to, you know, just depends on your credit, really. Also. Yeah, I have good credit, definitely. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I don't want to mislead you, so.

We use, you know, I mean, [ORGANIZATION] care. [ORGANIZATION] is one of our mainlanders anyhow, you know, so. But yeah, if you got great credit, you're going to get a great rate. The best rate possible. So no problem. So I'll look for the specs then. So you want the price on xle? We have the blue, blue one and a red one right now. Red one is the preferred for me. I mean, if you have both, then. Yeah, I am open. But since you said the red, red one is available. Okay, okay, let me see which ones are available and I'll get your price quote sent over. Excellent.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], how may I help you? Good afternoon. Can I speak to one of the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]? What can we do for you? Well, actually, you know, I'm sorry, I can probably ask you my question. So I'm interested in. I own a business and we have a car program for employees. And what we're really interested in doing is setting up some kind of a program to either purchase and or lease cars for my business. Okay, Okay. I think that's, that's the sum of it. I mean, we could do something like that. The only problem with all of that is right now is the inventory shortage. I could, you know, we couldn't get to see a car. The prices are going to be, you know, higher, regardless of anything. It's just because of the inventory shortage. So I don't know if we'd be able to give like in a definitive pricing saying, hey, this is what it would be. Just because, like I said, the car shortage, they are what they are at this point. Well, so that's happening, you know, no matter where I go. And so I still need to have, you know, we still can't walk. We have to drive. No, yeah, and that's what I'm saying. I just wouldn't be able to give you definitive pricing. But I mean, we'd be more than happy to work with you guys. I think there's bigger picture things. I appreciate that. That's all. Work with us. There's bigger picture things. So, for example, will you lease to a business as long as you have a tax ID number and the vehicle is registered to the business? Oh, agreed. And they would be insuring them through the business? Yeah, it has to be insured and registered through the business. And then, yes, we can. Okay. Yep, yep, we're doing that. Quick question. Has the business ever purchased anything before or is there going to be a personal guarantee? Well, we've never purchased. This business, has never purchased anything from you. I have me as a person. I'm the 51% [OCCUPATION] of the business. The business has a fleet of probably right now about 35 vehicles. We're not a teeny tiny business. We'll flee with about 35 vehicles. I think some of them are probably owned by the company and some of them are leased. We have a leasing agreement with [ORGANIZATION] right now. I'm just not, I'm not super enthusiastic with how things are all working out. And so I'm kind of looking at, looking around going, well, what happens if I do this a little differently? Right? I mean, we definitely not super unhappy either. I'M not mad. I'm just. I mean, again, as long as. Yeah, as long as the cars are insured. Through there you have a tax ID number. You obviously have vehicles registered through that. Through that business already, correct? Yeah. I mean, it's not. Oh, yeah, there's lots of them. There's 35 vehicles registered in the business. Yeah, it all depends if you want to be a personal guarantor. Just do it all through the business. It's however you want to do it, but it's feasible. We've definitely done it personally. So who would I work with to kind of sort out all the details? I'm going to have you reach out. You know what, I'm going to take your information. I'm going to have [PERSON_NAME] call you when he comes in. Okay. Because I don't trust anyone. Yeah, I'm going to do that. What was your first name? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. So last name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. And what's the business name? This is called [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. And what's the best phone number? As long as you use my. He should be in shortly. Okay. I know that we have a [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] meeting together, so hopefully I can get him, but he's our [OCCUPATION] or [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], so he'd be the best person to set something like that up first. Yeah, yeah. So he'll, you know, be able to facilitate a little bit more than I can for you. Okay. Okay. I appreciate it. You're welcome.

"Please hold while your call is being transferred to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME], how can I help you? Hi [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME]. I have a question. I'm looking for [ORGANIZATION] Tundra, new or preferably used, but [DURATION] [DURATION] old plug body style. Do you guys have anything in stock? Hi [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, let me see what I have in stock here. And I'm sorry, I didn't catch if you were looking for new or open to certified used. Well, yes, I'm open to if you have a [DATE_INTERVAL] for example, the new model but used. I would prefer that because I don't mind having few miles on it. But if you do not have any pre owned ones then. New, what new do you have? New? Okay, I'm sure that we do have some great used ones. Let me pull up our inventory here. And [PERSON_NAME], have you shopped with B version [ORGANIZATION] before? No. Okay, no worries. I'm glad that we're talking then. Like I said, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm not a [OCCUPATION], I'm really just here to help you shop. Is the number you're calling from, the callback number in case we get disconnected? Yes, please. Okay, thank you. So [PHONE_NUMBER]. I'm sorry, [ORGANIZATION] Tundra. We have, we have a [DATE_INTERVAL] and a [DATE_INTERVAL] owner lot currently that are available for a test drive. Did you want to come check these out today or tomorrow? Well, [DATE_INTERVAL] and [DATE_INTERVAL], they're the previous body style, correct? Sorry, one more time. The [DATE_INTERVAL] is the previous body style. The new body came out in [DATE_INTERVAL] I think, right? Or am I. Oh, am I not correct? Correct, you're correct. Yeah, the new body style was out in [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay, well then in that case I'm interested. If you don't have any [DATE_INTERVAL] ones, then what new do you have? I'm not interested in SR5, I'm interested in limited or platinum, whatever they're called. Okay, got it. So the [DATE_INTERVAL] is actually a Tundra Platinum. So that would be a good one to look at. I do have a lot of great Tundras, like Limited Platinum, [DATE_INTERVAL] edition. They're on their way available for a deposit. Would you be interested in putting a deposit on one of these? Yes. What is the turnaround time currently for expected delivery time? About it looks like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] for some of them. Oh, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], that's not bad. But all the specs and everything all are available to look at how can I get that information at least so I can see what's coming? Is it possible or do I need to come in for that? Because I'm in [LOCATION] right now. You're aware. I'm sorry. Well, how can I get that information as far as what do you have coming or what's available? Yeah, absolutely. Ideally I'm looking for. Ah, yes, okay. I'm sorry for interrupting. Go ahead. Oh, I apologize. Go ahead. Let me know what you're looking for. For Tundra, preferably pre owned. Have any pre owned new one in white, preferably limited or better not necessarily attached to hybrid, but I would like to consider a hybrid option if available. The price difference between gasoline and hybrid. Yeah. And if you could text me a link or something where I can take a look at what the thing do you think? Ideally I would like to turn in one of my vehicles as an exchange or down payment. Do you have, do you accept stars? I have a [ORGANIZATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Camry. Yes, absolutely. Yeah, we're always looking for pre owned vehicles so we'd be happy to give you a great trade value for yours. But yes, I will send you a few links to the ones that we have coming that are available for a deposit. Should I send it? Okay, sounds good. And assuming that you like what I'm sending you, were you planning on coming by today or tomorrow to get a trade trade for the Camry and then maybe put a deposit? Well, not today for sure and not tomorrow for sure. I am sort of turning in my car right now to a detailed place. So you know, they clean it up and they said tomorrow I would be able to pick it up. So only before probably Friday, Friday or Saturday. Are you guys open on Saturdays? Oh yes, absolutely. And we're also open Sunday. Okay, well as I said, I'm in [LOCATION] currently. So when we're returning to [LOCATION] after my stuff is done here. So [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] I need at least to get the car detailed and have your way. So hopefully nothing will change by then. But then yeah, whatever you have, I will look at it and see if anything catches my eye. And then how do you guys operate in general? Because different dealerships I heard do it differently. Do you mark up MSRP by a certain amount or do you not mark up it? How do you go about that? So we are usually at MSRP the only markup is going to be added accessories and usually those accessories include the full expel, which is clear film that goes on the paint to protect the paint, window taking and wheel lock. So that's really it. And I will include that. I'll include the prices and what the accessories are on the vehicle. So you're aware of all the prices. But those accessories are pre installed already and that price is pretty much that price is the price because they already are there or are those optional, any of them or do you actually do it after you receive them? So the added accessories are actually installed once the vehicle arrives on the ground, but they are not optional. They have been hand picked and will be installed when the vehicle does arrive. Okay, all right, well, thank you very much. Send me that information. I'm interested in seeing what you guys have. Another sort of final question. When I look at those links, will I have. Will there be any indication as far as which model is coming in, when or from where, or just. Or I would need to call you probably and discuss the one that I like separately, I guess. The links I'm going to send you are spec sheets to the specific vehicle, specific trim, specific packages to the car. And if texting is better, you can also text me and we can keep in touch that way. But phone call is good too. You can let me know what vehicle you'd like to specifically hold. But you know, the deposit is first come, first serve. So if you're interested in just all of them and want to decide when you're here, that works as well. Okay, well, wonderful. Thank you so much. I will. I'm looking forward to seeing your text message. Sounds good, [PERSON_NAME]. And then one last question for you. What is your last name? Last name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] oh. Since I have you on the phone, I'm also curious to know. I would like to ideally use my vehicle, a return vehicle, as a down payment. That can be done. Right? What documentation would I need to bring so I don't have to go back and forth and just have everything ready to apply for financing for the remaining balance. Do you know what, what I need to have. I don't want to really stop. I'm currently financed to [ORGANIZATION]. I have another [ORGANIZATION], but from [ORGANIZATION], I don't remember. And so I, you know, I've been with you guys for some time, not with your particular dealership. What do I need to do? No, no, it can be paid off, can be sprayed off. Oh, okay. Okay. It's just I have financing history through [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] as well and still on another vehicle. But for my financial documentation, what do I need to bring in order to sort of have everything on this pipeline? I'm not sure about the whole list. But I can also find out for you and text you what it would be that you need to bring for financing. Or maybe if there is a way to get pre qualified before I even come in, I can provide all preliminary information so you guys can run the numbers. I guess. And I know that I'm coming in just to pick it up. I'm still buying it blindly. For me. It doesn't matter to sit there for [DURATION] [DURATION] at the dealership and just wait for them to do it. I can just. Can you find out from your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] if I can get pre approved before I even come in? Because the value of the vehicle is secondary. You know, down payment is sort of pretty much plus or minus estimated to be whatever it needs to be. And if my tariff value is too low, I'm not going to just. I'm still going to probably go with the deal on some other terms, but I will be prepared for it. Yeah. Please find out and let me know what I need to bring with me. Yes. Or if I can be pre qualified. Thank you so much. Of course. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. We'll keep in touch.",success,inventory_check,Tundra,medium,True,0c140ba5e8024f52819e9a0c05b179aa_transcript.json

"Hello, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] speaking. Yes, how are you doing? I was just wondering, do you have any [ORGANIZATION] Highlanders available? I think I have maybe two or three here on the lot. Let me check for you real quick. Are you looking for a particular trim level? Not particularly a trim level. I am looking for some. A model that has maybe all wheel drive, possibly towing capacity of £3,500. So all the Highlanders, unless you go with an older model, all the new Highlanders are going to have 5,000 in towing package or in towing capabilities. But are you looking to be in a certain price point? Well, the Ls, according to what I'm seeing online, the L models are what, [MONEY_AMOUNT] right now. So that's the base MSRP. That's before delivery from the factory. Any packages that are on there? Like when they advertise these online, they say, hey, L models starting at. Right. That means that they could have more or less packages depending on how they're built. Then you have to take into consideration delivery. But it's, it's right around there. Let me see if I even have. Do the L models come all wheel drive? That I'm not sure. Like I have an L model, it says in stock, but I'd have to put eyes on it to make sure. It's actually MSRP is right at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right. I have, I have an XLE here. Front wheel drive, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I got a limited coming. I got another limited coming. Platinum. Yeah, I'm not really interested in the, in the top like models. If I could find something like luxurious is not my forte. So if I could just get something that is. Has the towing capacity that I'm looking for as well as all wheel drive. That's mainly what I'm kind of going for. Anything else? I'm just not interested in it. Right on. Are you open to maybe a pre owned Highlander as well? Just in case I might have a good one? Would depend on the year as well as you know, the maintenance history. I would have to. I would have to look at that. Okay. And then as far as purchasing, were you trading a car, you looking to be at a particular payment? No, I would, I would have to. I would have to come and actually visualize the. And see the car and see what shape it's in. If, if it's a used one, if it's pre owned, of course. Right. Yeah. I was gonna say I'm not sure how many all wheel drives I have. It has to be all wheel drive. You won't do a front wheel drive. Front wheel drive is not the greatest for towing. What are you going to be towing? I'm not going to be towing a lot. You know, £5,000. That's really not a lot. But the max. Yeah, the max. It all depends on. On the gross weight of the vehicle and the trailer. That's. That's why I got to factor in so even, you know. Yeah. So if the vehicle is like 3, 500 towing capacity, it's probably going to be less than that depending on what I'm carrying in my car. So that, that's why 3500 is probably the minimum I would go. Okay, well, you're definitely going to get that in a Highlander, right? I would like the four, the forerunners, but Forerunners are. They're way too much. Yeah, they're about anywhere from [MONEY_AMOUNT] to $[MONEY_AMOUNT] more than, you know, it depends. I mean, I do have some 4x4 4 runners here for sure. And they're nice. If you were looking to be at a particular payment, maybe they would work a deal for you. But what I can do is let me check with my [OCCUPATION] and see if we have all wheel drive Highlander here.

Are you looking at the rate? Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah, we have a couple rates here right now. A couple new ones. That's right. Yeah. They're [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], but they're brand new. Right. I guess I'm gonna. That's right. Take a ride. Yeah. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's a good price. I thought so. Yeah, I would like to. You're in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], huh? Yeah. Where do you live? In [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. I'm a long ways away. Okay. Yeah. So you have more than one of those on this, on site? Is that what you're saying? Because my [MARITAL_STATUS] is. She's got. She looked at one here in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], but somebody just traded it in and. And they want the same price for that one as you want for a new one. So I'm gonna go buy a new one. Gosh. Yeah. Really? Okay. So the. The. I'm sitting in a restaurant. We were just eating and doing it. I guess I need to go look, get on my. Get at home, get on my computer so we could down. I guess I could download from you what the floor plan looks like, the colors and that kind of stuff, right? Yeah. How about this? If I could get your contact info, maybe an email, I could send you a whole bunch of stuff on that. Okay. Yes, good idea. All right, here it is. One second, one second. I apologize. We got a delay on this phone when it gets forwarded to my cell phone. Okay, I'm here at my desk. I'm ready to go. All right, what is it and what's your name, sir? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And my phone number is. Got it. Okay, [PERSON_NAME], I'm going to send you some more info to you there on the rates, both from my website as well as from [ORGANIZATION]. What else can I get for you? Well, that's. I just wanted. I was a little bit worried about the horsepower in that V8 because I mean, in a V6 diesel and I was going to pull a [ORGANIZATION] Gladiator behind it. You think I'm going to have any problem with that? No, sir. I got two guys in the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] area, real good friends. They both bought their. They have a Triumph in a race, same engine that they bought here with me. And they're towing their Jeeps on flatbed trailers and go and put her out to [LOCATION] and they're doing great. Wow. They're super happy with that. So that's a good idea. I got a flat. I got a big flatbed trailer that I could put my [ORGANIZATION] on too, but I'd sooner just buy. I'm just. I'm just getting ready to buy one. You know, I'm not. I'm [OCCUPATION]. I want to buy. I want sooner buy a new one and I'm gonna buy me a new gladiator too. So you probably don't have one of those for sale there. We do across town out in [LOCATION]. Yeah, the [ORGANIZATION] have that [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION]. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's good. I'm glad I found. I'm glad I found your website. Like I said, I'm sitting in a restaurant eating lunch right now.

My name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'll be in touch. You got my contact info and we'll talk again soon. Yeah, there's some. I guess there's some place in town I could spend the night there. Right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, we got a long drive to get up there from [LOCATION] [LOCATION], you know, you know, from. Actually from [LOCATION] [LOCATION], even farther. And so anyway, yeah, I mean, I. If I like what I see, I'll buy one and drive it home. So we could even. Beautiful. Yeah, I could even pull. I bet I could pull my trailer up there and put my car on the trailer and drive it home. You could put. You can. I just did one of those on Saturday with the guy from [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. Drove his Tacoma out here, towing the trailer, and hooked onto his Class C, the Super C, and towed it all the way home. Okay. I like the sound of all that. All right, and your name is? [PERSON_NAME].

Like I have a rack. Yeah, I'm sure we can help facilitate that. You're usually looking at. Yeah, you just want to make sure that we get it put on before you take it. Ideally because, you know, it's summer and you know, bike rack that I won't be able to use if I don't have it. It's a 2 inch by 2 inch, I think they are. We just have to make sure that you can put a 2 inch receiver on there, which I'm pretty sure you should be able to. It's funny that you mentioned that because I have a little electric car as well and I have a 2 inch receiver just for that reason. I don't tow anything, but I use it for my bike rack. Yeah, that's gonna work. So I don't want to get rid of the bike rack because I don't have a hitch. So that's what I'm talking about. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] is supposed to be my contact person.

Okay, [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] calling and we have [DURATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] CX5 that is coming up due on lease here [DATE] [DATE] and we want to purchase our vehicle outright. Okay. We do have financing already or have our bank that will be handling our financing, but what they are requiring is [DURATION] purchase agreement from [ORGANIZATION]. I did, [PERSON_NAME], I wanted to say [PERSON_NAME], but that is not his name, but he had indicated when I was in there, we were looking at potentially getting into [DURATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] to lease. Decided against it because of the value of our vehicle and just can't find anything else out there. So we want to purchase outright. He'd indicated I could contact [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. However, when I tried to do that through them here [DURATION] little bit ago, they pointed me back to you guys. You bet. So there's just very, very recently [DURATION] change in this process. It used to absolutely be correct that you would just reach out to them if you were handling everything on your own. They have changed things now. It was [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, I think, that I talked to [PERSON_NAME]. So if it's just recently been changed, I can understand that. So, yeah, absolutely, that is the case. And the way we found out was from calls like this, where they say no, actually they changed it so nobody even bothered to inform us about it. So isn't that how it usually goes? Oh, absolutely, absolutely. All right, so what we will need to do here then is I'll just need to get you with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. That will all still go through him. So then there will likely be. You will likely need to stop in then and just sign some paperwork with us. Then this won't be [DURATION] problem. What is the best number to reach out to? My [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] is actually just in [DURATION] deal right now, so he's not available to speak. Sure. Okay.

And then pieces of information that he'll need to move this forward for you. He'll need, like, current miles on the vehicle and all of that kind of stuff, too, because we'll need to print up, like, odometer statements and all that good stuff for you as well. But he'll go over that stuff when he reaches out to you then. Okay? Okay. All right. Perfect. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. Do you have [DURATION] pen handy? Yes. Okay. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] here. And I'll give you my direct number as well in the meantime, should you need anything or come up with any other questions. So my number. I will.

That was on Tuesday afternoon. And Thursday afternoon I called again and said I don't know whether my car is safe to drive yet. And they said that they would send an urgent message to the [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION]. And here another [DURATION] has gone by and I still haven't heard anything. Okay, what's going on with your car? Well, it would have this big orange triangle. It would have a ding [DURATION] [DURATION] big orange triangle. And it would happen so fast while I was driving that I couldn't read it. But then it started happening so frequently that I finally said found that it said check differential. Okay, so I mean, when you're driving your car, does it feel like it's normal running feeling? Is there anything that you feel out of the ordinary? I don't think so. Okay, I do know. Is this on a Genesis yes, it's a GV80. Okay. Yeah. So we've been hearing some of these little incidences happening with the slip differential. I have not heard any kind of feedback that it's dangerous by any means. And as long as you're having, you haven't had anything like that either. Are they just coming in with the check engine light, that slip differential on the Genesis? Yeah. Right. So it's not a dangerous thing. What it's telling you also is that instead of your car being an all wheel drive, it's a rear wheel drive right now, so you're safe to drive it until you get in for your appointment. But we've been hearing about this happening often, frequently on the Genesis. I'm not sure what the fix is. I haven't heard that. But I can tell you that you're still safe to drive your car. Okay, well, thank you very much for finally getting back to me. You're so welcome. And hopefully that makes you feel a little bit more comfort. Well, yeah, I haven't had a car.

We don't have a [DATE_INTERVAL] that's going to be black. Okay, what do you have? So we have a. Let me see this real quick. I just. I think we got a trade in. So of course we got a couple of new. We have a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Do you want to know just what we have in black or just what in general? In general, we have a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Do you just want another pre owned as well? Yes, please. Okay, so the [DATE_INTERVAL], we have a Premier Blazer and that's midnight blue metallic. And then what's the mineage and price? The mileage on that one is 28,000. Okay. I don't have any prices right now. I mean, I'm pretty sure that one, it's a Premier. It's probably going to be in the upper 30s because of the low mileage. And then we have another. They did auditing this morning. That's why I can't see anything. And then we have another [DATE_INTERVAL] Blazer. That one is Cajun red. That one's going to be in the mid-30s, has 19,000 miles on it. And we have a [DATE_INTERVAL]. We have another [DATE_INTERVAL]. That one's an LT and that one almost looks silver. Okay. And that one is 37,000 miles. And then we have a [DATE_INTERVAL] that's black. And that one's an LT. It's a one LT. And that one has 35,000 miles on it. And then we have another [DATE_INTERVAL], that's Cajun red and that one has 36,000 miles. Okay. And I think. Let me see about this [DATE_INTERVAL] real quick. I wonder if we just got this one in on trade. Let me check on this one real quick for you. I think we just got this one out on trade. Sorry, I'm logging into this other system really quick. That way I can just double check on this one. Okay, sounds good. Because I think it might be a first trade that we just got. Oh no, we don't have that one. So I did. But those other ones are the ones that we have right now. But what we can do also, like if she's just wanting a black [DATE_INTERVAL], a [DATE_INTERVAL] Blazer LT, we can locate one for her. Because I mean with us being [LOCATION] owned, we actually have dealerships all over the, all over [LOCATION], all over [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. So. So we can find one for you. That's not a problem at all. Yeah, so that's if that's something that she really wants and she's like, no, I want [DATE_INTERVAL] LT. We can definitely get one for her. That's not a problem. Okay, perfect. So what would we have to do in order to do that? She would just come in, deal with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and then that way he knows exactly. Okay, this is what she's wanting, some sort of commitment. So that way we're not just getting the vehicle because it's kind of a little bit of a process of going to get it wherever it's at us getting that vehicle from them and everything like that. Okay. Okay. All righty. Well, [PERSON_NAME], I've been looking. I tell you. We just found out that the car is a total loss yesterday. So we just started looking around. We're in [LOCATION]. So do you want me to. Do you want me to keep in contact with you if like one. Because I mean we get trade ins every single day, so I don't mind. What's your first and last name? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. It's [PERSON_NAME] as well. Yes. Okay. And then your callback number and then what mileage is good for you guys? Like I know you're wanting low mileage. Yes. You see the one that we got? Well, the one that she got in [DATE_INTERVAL], it had about 6,000 miles. So we would like to be somewhere. We would like low mileage and she got it for like [MONEY_AMOUNT] I believe. But yeah, we're looking for something around that. This was her very first vehicle. That she got [INJURY] [INJURY] [INJURY] and thank goodness we didn't have any trouble. So we're trying to do this. I would have been devastated if that was my very first vehicle and it totaled and it just one that she just loves because I have a blazer and I love my blazer. I'm not gonna like. I love it. It's perfect. Yes. [PERSON_NAME] loved her blazer. You know, we will ask her, do you want a different color? You want something different? She's like, no, I want the same exact thing. So we're looking for things. Okay, well, I don't mind helping you guys at all. I'll keep an eye out. I'll get with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] too as well and just kind of let him know. I mean, because we get trade ins every single day. We're always buying vehicles. They're always sending us vehicles from other dealerships because obviously we sell blazers like it's nobody's business. Just like with Tahoes and Suburbans, like, they're really popular right now. So dealerships from other, you know, cities and states. And so they're always sending it to us. If they can't sell it, then they'll just send it to us because, you know, [ORGANIZATION] knows we'll sell it. Perfect. Perfect. Yes. Please keep us in mind. Okay, Is there like a. Have you guys already did your paperwork? Everything? Well, right now I know our insurance is going through all that. So what you told me yesterday was that once we get that email where that vehicle is a total loss, that's all we need it. Is that correct? All you need is that email and that just stating that it's the total loss. This is how much we're giving you, you know, for your vehicle. As long as you have that email, we can sell you a vehicle. Okay. Okay. I don't know. Because that shows proof. I'm sorry, I don't know if we're there already. I know that yesterday [PERSON_NAME] did speak to the, to the [OCCUPATION] and they did tell her it's a total law. I'm working on your settlement, you know, so. So I know that's where we're at. I don't know. And tell her to stay on it. Tell her to stay on it because as long as she stays on, you know, calling them and you know, staying on it, like, I just need that email. And they will, they'll push it. They'll. Perfect. Because that's just how it is a lot of times. I know that's what my [MARITAL_STATUS] had to do. He. When he got into that really, really bad accident with his truck. He had another truck within the next [DURATION] [DURATION]. Like, it didn't take long at all. Like, they did the appraisal quick, but it's because he was on it. He was on top of it. Because, I mean, it was his work truck. So he. And then they. But once he got the paperwork, I want to say it was like he didn't even know he had the paperwork in yet because they did the appraisal like [DURATION] [DURATION] later, and then it took, like another [DURATION] [DURATION] for everything to process. And he didn't even know he had the email yet. They're like, well, we sent you the email. He's like, what? He had the email. He sent it to me. I printed it out and gave it to my boss. I said, let's get him a joke because he's got to go back to work. Exactly. Because we need it. Exactly, exactly. Well, yes, yes, I'll tell her. Which I have. I'm like, you need to stay on him. But she's only [PERSON_AGE], so, you know, it's her first time experience something like this. I'm like, you need to stay on them. You need to keep calling. But. Okay, yes. Please keep us in mind, [PERSON_NAME], if you see anything. I sure will. I promise. Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate your help. No problem. Bye.

"Thank you for calling. This is [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. Hi. I bought a car a while back [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago from you guys. It was actually a [ORGANIZATION] Pilot and I was told that the fluids were changed when I bought the car. I just can't find the paperwork saying that. I just wanted to confirm if they were, because I took my car in for service and they're telling me that that wasn't changed. And I want to see if it really was changed so I don't have to pay them. Yeah. So all of our vehicles, if we do sell them here, in order for us to put them front line, they go through a pre delivery inspection. And what that entails is fluids, filters, all that inspection, oil change, tire rotation, if it needs brakes, tires, anything, etc. So it does go through a inspection process to make sure that if there is anything that needs to be replaced or repaired, it does get done. Let me see if I can pull up your CarFax, because your CarFax will show a list of everything that was done to the vehicle. Do you mind if I put you on a brief hold so I can run back to my computer and pull that up for you? No, of course, go ahead. Okay. Just give me one second. No problem. All right. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. All right, so what was the last name that you registered the vehicle under? It would be my last name. It's [PERSON_NAME]. Do you need the spelling of that? Yes, it. How would I spell that out? It's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. All righty. Because I was also told that the brakes were changed and the service place is telling me that they need to fix the brakes too, which doesn't sound correct to me. Where did you take it for service to? [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, so what I did is I printed out the Carfax here. I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to email that over to you so you have record of everything. It'll show on the last page the [ORGANIZATION] cars of [ORGANIZATION]. It'll show what all we did before selling the vehicle. Okay, perfect. Because I remember when they sold it to me, he did mention some of the stuff that they're mentioning. So I don't want to get charged for something that I don't need to pay. Of course. And then let me just double check that we do still have the correct email on file. Okay. That's my boyfriend's email. Yeah, go ahead and send it to him. I could always just pull it off of his. Okay. I will go ahead and send it over that way. And if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out and let us know. Otherwise, you have your copy of the Carfax. Now. Can you just wait a minute so I know that I got it because I'd love to show [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, they're charging me $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for this. Check your email. Is the email going to be under, like, [PERSON_NAME], it's an arrowhead BMW. All the stuff they're charging me. They're charging me for all kinds of fluids. All filters, actually. All fluids and all filters. Just taking a minute to get through. Are you able to tell me what rule rules this? I mean, it'll pop up, but it's just taking a minute. Yeah, they did. And the date's on there, right? Yeah. So it shows that it was [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. They did a wash in detail. They took it through the emissions check. They replaced tires. They did an oil and filter change, and then they repaired a wheel. And then it looks like the previous owner, back in [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL], did a full service. They did a maintenance inspection, an oil and filter change, an engine check, an alignment, the. The key programming, four new tires, timing, belt replacement, and a tire balance. Does it say anything about fluids or filters? No, it doesn't. We have an oil and filter change that we did for an oil filter on [DATE] [DATE]. Okay. And the. The dates are on there, right, like you said? Yeah. Okay. That was one of the things that they're trying to charge me for. Okay, well, it came through, so I can go ahead and show them proof of what they're claiming the car needs. Okay. But thank you so much for that. Of course. Have a good day. You as well.",success,general_inquiry,Pilot,medium,False,0c473bc7008c46398c01d1cd5870c922_transcript.json
"Good day. It's great to hear. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I just. [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME], who I have the pleasure of speaking with. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. You said [PERSON_NAME] or [PERSON_NAME]? Yep. [PERSON_NAME]. All right, [PERSON_NAME] Just in case we could get disconnected with a good phone number to call you back at [PHONE_NUMBER]. And how can I tell to you today, [PERSON_NAME]? So I normally drive [ORGANIZATION] pickup trucks. I have a F250 Platinum right now. And what I want to know is any [ORGANIZATION] lineup, because [ORGANIZATION] gonna piss me off. So in the [ORGANIZATION] lineup, what is comparable to like a Platinum or something like that? You probably need a. Probably the Limited or Laramie Longhorn. Longhorn Limited, something like that. So that's the. Yeah, that's the, that's the top tier. Okay. What is a Rebel? The Rebel is, it's like a, it's like, it's a kind of, it's a meaner look kind of. You know, it's got like vents in the hood, kind of some off road type of tires. Just kind of looks meaner. Okay. All right. So I mean I would. So as far as, so, so as far as class, I would probably put that probably right below the Limited or the Laramie. Okay, but it's not a base. What are you losing? What are you losing? You just losing like the seats or something like that? It just, it just depends on how it's, how it's ordered because I mean, a lot of times you'll see you still get the big 12 inch screen in it. You'll get the, you'll get the leather seats. You probably, probably won't get the, the power running boards. You won't get the. I don't see a Rebel with a panoramic sunroof. I don't think you get the panoramic sunroof. Someone will have the regular sunroof. Won't have a panoramic and that. Well, that. Well, if you're getting a 2500 anyway, it's not gonna have panoramic anyway. It's just gonna have a regular sunroof if it has a sunroof in it. But that's pretty much it. You can't get a panoramic and, or a big one in a 2500. I haven't seen, have you ever seen a panoramic sunroof in 2500? Yeah. Oh, okay. And the rebel 2500. Yeah, they do have panoramic in it. Okay, So a rebel 2500, you're just like, you get. I Can get the big sunroof, I can get the big screen. All I just want to have is high class seats and then stuff like that in it. Yeah, you'll still get. It just, it just depends because it just depends on what, what's ordered in it because you know, limited, you'll have limiteds and you'll have everything. I mean you'll hear heated and cool seats, you have everything. It just each, it just depends on how it's ordered and how it's built. Okay, I know you have a couple rebels on the, on the ground right now. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], let me look real quick. You are talking about brand new, right? Brand new, yeah. You and you talking about gas or diesel? Diesel. I got you. Okay, what time we think. Okay. Do you have a color for you? I see three rebels here right now. I got a light silver metallic, a high hydro blue and a granite crystal metallic. So looking at those three, which. All three of those are fine in color. I have a, I think I have a granite. I think mine's granite gray. My, my jeep. But are those three. I mean how are they loaded out? Let me see. They're all about the same. [PERSON_NAME]. This ground was a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. They're all, they're, they're, they're. The cheapest one I'm looking at is [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And the most expensive one is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So it's about [MONEY_AMOUNT] difference in price. So I'm assuming the one that the more expensive one has more features. I just have to really just go through and look through the both of all their window stickers just to see exactly what it is that if you know, it's different between the three. Okay, so any three of them have the big sunroof. Let me look real quick. Black one, the white one. But they're both convertible. By turn light on [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] and turn light, turn right at the traffic light. What I'm looking at on the window sticker, I'm not seeing it. I'd like to go to put our eyes on them. You just know for sure I have your number here. So what's that [PERSON_NAME] stand for? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. All right. Curiosity. If I wanted to, I wanted a special order one. How long would it take? I want, I like to say [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Some, some vehicles [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], some vehicles [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. That ain't too bad. Okay, that's, that's, that's another option then. Yeah. Okay, well, let me go. Let me go out here and look and put eyes on these three and see, you know, just so I can know exactly what the features are on and call you back. Yep. All right, I'll call. I'll call you back here shortly. All right, thank you.",failure,feature_question,Rebel 2500,medium,True,0c59d813d5ce43d09508179307e5e5be_transcript.json

Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Thank you so much. And Ms. [PERSON_NAME], what's a good callback number in case I do have to leave a message? Thank you so much. Give me just a quick second. I'm going to reach out and try to grab one of my [OCCUPATION] for you so we can go over some warranty information. Okay? Yes, ma' am. Thank you. Thank you. All right, Ms. [PERSON_NAME], bear with me just a brief moment. I'm going to go ahead and try to reach out to my [OCCUPATION] now, of course, in the event you and I do not speak again, I do want to thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] for your service needs. We do appreciate your business. Give me one moment. Yes, ma' am, can you hear me? Oh, hello. Yes, ma' am. I'm trying to find out when my. Hello? Kidding. Service. Okay. I'm trying to find out when my warranty's up on my vehicle, what's going on with the vehicle. Like whenever I change my AC vent, you know the AC to like top to bottom, you can hear it like making the shuttering sound. Okay, so anything AC related would be fall under basic warranty. So [DURATION] [DURATION] or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first. Okay. All righty. Are you over the 36,000? No, I'm at 34. Okay, good. And then Let me see if we have any warranty. Hold on. And then once he gets his inspection, he's got to upload a report. Yeah, you don't have anything on our end. So it looks like the basic warranty is good for till [DATE] [DATE], [DATE], or 36,000 miles. Yeah. So if I drop it off, like, how long will it take to get fixed? You would have to drop it off for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, so can I schedule. Can I just drop it off maybe, like, this evening? Because I'm going out of town next [DURATION]. Yeah, that's fine. It won't go into the shop until Tuesday. Holiday weekend. Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, okay. So as long as I'm under 36,000, right, I'm good. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, I might just wait until I get back from vacation and then schedule it. And then I'll have to get an oil change, too, so I'll get them two in one. Can I do that? Yes, ma' am. Okay. Thank you, customer.

"[PERSON_NAME] speaking, how can I help you? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and I'm up in [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. I'm not sure which which place I called. You actually got the call center for the whole company, sir. What's that? You got the call center for the whole company? Okay, I want to talk to somebody in [ORGANIZATION]. For which. For which city? I guess it doesn't matter. I'm in [LOCATION]. There's none of them anywhere close to me. Okay, what are you looking for so I can get you over to the right store? I'm looking for a class A diesel motorhome, used. All right, let me get you over to one of our [LOCATION] stores and they should be able to help you out. Okay? Yeah, they're closest to me. Yeah, that works fine. Thank you. All right, hold on a second, please. Thanks. Honey? Is this [PERSON_NAME]? This is honey. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How could I help you, [PERSON_NAME]? I think I talked to you [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. It's very possible. You know what's funny is I just had a guy yesterday that I met at an RV show and lo and behold, he goes, man, just man. I said, thanks, man. Here at the dealership? No, I called the dealership because you guys had a. It was a [ORGANIZATION] 5500 Super C. I ended up buying just a regular class A [DATE_INTERVAL]. But I want to go with something that I can stay in longer. You know, I stay in this one [DURATION] [DURATION] at a time and. And that's about max. And I want you. What do you have now? I've got a [DATE_INTERVAL] Jayco, Red Hawk, 29 XK, gotcha. And I want a diesel. You know, 40 to 42. I'd like a bath and a half and I'd like a tag axle, but I don't know if my budget will let me have all of it. I'm looking used. You're looking used because a lot of times our pre owned or new are discounted pretty heavy as well. Tell you what, I have new, but I. Go ahead. Yeah, but I'm in like the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] range. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, so yeah, new's gonna be out of the question. Let me see what I have in my pre owned side. I had a nice. I had a nice. I'm pretty sure I saw you guys had like a allegro butt, but it was. It wasn't a tag. And I don't think it was a bath and a half, but it was beautiful. Was a [MONEY_AMOUNT] something. Maybe it was [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's a [MONEY_AMOUNT] PA that you're probably seeing [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, but that's a red. A [MONEY_AMOUNT] a bunch. That's hard to get in that price range. Yeah. What is the [MONEY_AMOUNT] that's like higher than like a Phaeton. Yeah. Bus is top of the line. And then the only thing above that is a Zephyr. But they only. They only make like 12 to 15 of them [DURATION] [DURATION]. Is the tag necessary? You have to have a tag axle. Well, you know, the box. Are you towing something heavy? Is that why you want the tag or. Well, not super heavy. Like right now I tow a trailer, an enclosed trailer. But what I want to do is tow like a full size pickup truck. Then I'm going to put a capital pickup way. Do you know maybe 7,000, 8,000. So most of your. Not most, I'd say probably 90 of your. Excuse me. 40 footers, 38 footers, 36 footers will tow £10,000. So if you want to save the tires, you know, the tag is nice, but that, you know, you do have a little [PERSON_NAME] maintenance on them. Right. Let me see if this one's a bath and a half. I have a nice revolution here. That's in the low twos. That's a really nice [OCCUPATION]. It's a 17 or 32,000 miles, which is not improved. Who makes the revolution? [ORGANIZATION]. Oh, [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, because I want to. I want the higher end [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] and tag grow. This means revolution is up. The revolution is the highest that tip or [ORGANIZATION] makes. I put it right there with Integra. The. The tip and buses. I'll have to look at it. I mean, you don't have to buy it if you don't like it. But you know, you can look at it. But that's a coast. Would you put that on. On the same level as like a [ORGANIZATION] and a [LOCATION]? Absolutely. [DURATION] [DURATION] long. [DURATION] [DURATION] long. When you see the pictures of this, you'll be like, okay, yeah, you get a lot of. You get a lot of bang for the [MONEY_AMOUNT] with [ORGANIZATION]. And it's the same components. [ORGANIZATION]. The thing I like about [ORGANIZATION], when we learn some training on them, they do ambulances and fire trucks. They're very sound company. It's called [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. If you go look them up online, you'll see it. These [OCCUPATION] are immaculate. Earl Wood, big fridges, luxury inside. You go to the website, you'll see what I'm talking about. I'll give you a stock number in a minute. You can take A look at it. Ceiling fan in the rear dishwasher. Let's see. I didn't realize how late it was. Are you getting ready to head out until [TIME]? We got [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, let's see. I'm trying to see if it's got a map and a half into the floor plan here. And these will have the aqua hot, just like the buses and everything else. So. Yeah. This has a bath and a half. Do you have access to the website? I did. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] rv. Okay, quick search rv. Yep. So when you get a chance, let me know if you're on that search window and I'll tell you about this tag axle. The plus number. Yep. I'm ready. Go. Type in [VEHICLE_ID]. Take a look at that [OCCUPATION]. I'm looking for other tags here. Okay. Yeah. [LOCATION]. I think I did see this one online. Yeah. Did you? Okay. Now, let's see. You know, in the red, the Reds will mostly be in that, you know, 200 range, what you're looking. But if you want to go a little [PERSON_NAME], I have a Phaeton. Let me see if this has a. Yeah, the Reds have the smaller motor. Good. Yeah, they do. So if you're looking. That's right, you're showing. So, yeah, this one, I mean, that's a nice [OCCUPATION]. For the money, though, we've had that a little bit to reduce that. That's in the wrapper. I've been in that [OCCUPATION]. Yeah. It looks like [LOCATION]. They didn't really polish the wheels up much on it. I don't know. So, no. No recliners in this one. Other than the driver's. The seats flip around. Yeah. Whatever you see in them. Whatever you see in them pictures. Yeah, that's what's in it. That's actual pictures of that [OCCUPATION]. Yeah. This one's a bath and a half. Yeah. [DURATION] [DURATION] long. Yeah. Yeah. Has a nice shower. To your closet. Gorgeous. That [OCCUPATION] is gorgeous. That's a. That's a high. That's the highest [OCCUPATION] they made. Let me see. And the bath and a half is very important. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, I'm willing to bend a little bit. See, the issue I have is I have a trade. So it's. How would I do that? I'd almost have to, like, fly down, see if it's what I want, fly back, drive my rig down, you know, I don't know how else to do it. Here's what I would do instead. So if you see a [OCCUPATION] and we work out the figures and we agree the figures [MONEY_AMOUNT] could take it off the market with [DURATION] [DURATION] [MONEY_AMOUNT] that I send you pending a visual inspection and test drive. So I would go out there and do a walk around with you to make sure that you're into this [OCCUPATION] and not wasting your time. Yeah. And then if you're good when you get here, we do a test drive with you in an orientation as well. And then you know, it's good to go. Right. The only thing that scares me is I would have to drive mine down there if you're trading. Yeah. You know what? I guess I tried retail years at all I have. But I'm in a funny location and I am not really good at selling stuff. I've had a bunch of people click on it, only one person interested in it. And you know, it. It's. I think it's too new to be honest with you for like there's a lot of. There's a lot of. It's not that it's too new because there's a buyer for every seat, but it's probably because there's a lot of them out there. They mass produce that coast. So there are [DURATION] [DURATION] out there. Well. And I think it. People say well geez, I can go to the [OCCUPATION], spend [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [PERSON_NAME], but they're gonna sit down with me finance and I'm walking out the door. I'm done. You know. And usually have warranty. You're right. There's another ellipse. A [ORGANIZATION] ellipse. That's the. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL], but it's only got 39000 miles. That's in the low [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Let's just take a look at that as well. That's about it. That's about it. For a tag axle in the close to two. You know, they're not right at two, but they're close to two. Sorry [PERSON_NAME]. Let me, let me. This guy keeps. Oh, that's kind of. All right. I got it back based on. Yes. All right. What's the. What's the stock number on the one. The [ORGANIZATION] one you're talking about? Oh, the [ORGANIZATION] I still need. Give me a second. Let me get to that page I was looking through and see if I have anything else. [ORGANIZATION] Ellipse187.397. Now where would you put that with quality? So that was the best selling [OCCUPATION] of that year. These have the most room of anything. [ORGANIZATION] is known for Safety. I'd put that for that year. Right with the [ORGANIZATION]. They were very competitive with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] was bought out by [ORGANIZATION]. Did you know that? Yes. Yeah, [ORGANIZATION] a sound company. What I like about [ORGANIZATION] is they manufacture most of their parts in house except for like fridges, TVs, fireplace, blah, blah, blah. But they do a lot of in house. So you can always get, you know, a part for that if needed. Pretty, pretty properly because I know that you got a safe. Yeah, these two are about the same unit. Rough. You know what I mean? Same size, same price. Pretty, pretty close. Yeah. A little bit different setup with the seating. Recliner. There is a recliner. And yeah, I like every floor plan. I like the table setup. I'd love to get away from the dinette. Most people do. These are both all electric. Should be. Does it say there should be a build sheet? I'm not on that one because I was looking at some other stuff. Let me see real quick. It should be a build sheet when you get to the first page of that one. 8, 7, 397. Oh, this one looks like it has outdoor fridge. It could have Fridge, freezer. Oh, that's a pretty color. That's a gorgeous color tonight. So if you go to the website, you can list, you can see view msrp And I'll tell you what usually comes with the [OCCUPATION] as far as options. Tiny propane, like a. Just a little gas prop tank in it. What's that for? Let me see what you're talking about here. Is it on that in the storage base? Yeah. Where the hydraulic. So that's a. Yeah, that is a hot place. So that probably is all electric. Dishwasher. I'm getting there. Just bear with me here. It has a nice little pull out table there that extends out. Full size fridge, ceiling fan as well. Wow, there's a lot of pictures in here. Let's see what you're talking about here. There's a bag of goodies. I don't know what's in that bag. Certainly could find out. I'm kind of like. So this is a 42. Is it exactly 42 long? Yes. Yeah, that's 42. Before you see anything, you're seeing the groove in one of the pull outs or it's a gas grill tank. It's in the same bay as the hydraulic reservoir for the leveling system. Let me get there. I think that. Yeah, that's a fridge in that one. Too. And then it's weird. I've never seen that in there. Real, real. So that's a. That's a tank that you can do a gas grill on. So that's removable. You could do a gas grill out under your awning or wherever you want to set that up. Oh, that's just there. It's just like a tank you would have at home. You can remove it and use it for a grill outside. Right. It is connected to a regulator, though, of some sort. So maybe. Maybe it's got a setup so that you can have an outdoor grill or something. But that's what that is. It's for an outdoor grill. See that little green knob? And then that hose. That hose would connect to your grill. Your gas grill that you would have. And that's removable. You can take that right out. That's not good enough for the [OCCUPATION]. That wouldn't. Right. But it is connected to the [OCCUPATION]. That hose is connected to a regulator from the right corner. Huh. I wonder what that is. See that hose comes off the green knobs. Yeah. Just zoomed it up. Maybe there's a quick connect. Yeah, I'm sure there is a quick connect right there. So that could be for an auxiliary. Does that have the hot plates on the top, the induction inside the catch? Right. I did see that. Yeah. Yeah. I'd be curious to see what that does. I'd have to pull up with a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] on them. Usually you don't see that tank in this. In this [OCCUPATION]. That's a new one there. I bet the customer did that. But no, it's from the factory. No, it's got a tree there. So it is from the factory. Yeah. The thing with mine. I've got to call the [OCCUPATION] [PERSON_NAME]. I'm waiting. They've got a. I got a warranty thing. They got to replace the step motor. And also a shade inside. I'm waiting on that. But that's not. Yeah, that deal. It's not. It's just a tiny thing to get it done, you know? Are you. Where are you located? I'm in [LOCATION]. [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. But I've been. I've been to [LOCATION] with this with my little one six times. And it's time to get something that goes down the road a little better. It's quieter. You'll like a diesel if you've never had a diesel. It's a night and [DURATION] difference. All my trucks are diesel. I drive big trucks. All my trucks are diesel. Yeah, It's a big difference in a [OCCUPATION]. Though a gap to a diesel, it's a huge difference. Just because you can steer, you know, from what I hear from my customers, they don't get tired when they take a longer trip, you know, a [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] trip. And they can steer with one hand, you know, literally. Right? Yeah. If you could, you know, find out what you think mine for us and trade. Let's do this. I could email you a trade appraisal form or I can in the morning call you and then start a trade appraisal. If it's okay, send me the form and I'll, I'll fill it out and email it to you or something. Okay, Let me get your. [PERSON_NAME], I don't have your email. Is your last name [PERSON_NAME]? Yeah. Okay. Just want to make sure we're on the page. Go ahead. You ready? You ready? Yes. Yeah. I'm going to repeat it back to you. Okay. Okay. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. Yeah. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay, so I have. Let me do it one [PERSON_NAME] time. Just make sure I got this correct. Yes. Okay. I'll send it out right away and then tomorrow I'll get. Just fill it out and just get it back to me at least at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. And then I'll fill it out and see what we can do as far as the trade goes. Okay. And then. Are you in [LOCATION]? Yes, I'm at the [LOCATION] store. Okay. Now if, if, you know, I get my [MARITAL_STATUS] to look at these. So say there's like two or three that I'm interested in. Could I put money down on all three of them? Would I get my money back? No, I would. No. Narrow it down. They won't do. They won't take three [OCCUPATION] off the market. They'll only do one at a time. So just, you know, look at them. Take your time and make sure that, you know, that's what your [MARITAL_STATUS] likes and you like. There's an 80, 20 rule. 20%. You're probably not going to like 80%. You're going to. Okay, that'll work. So just try to narrow it down with you and the [MARITAL_STATUS] and once you do that, then if we decide on that [OCCUPATION], we can take that one off the market. Explain that to me. What's that? Explain that 20% thing again. So in RV and houses is the same. So in the rule they call it an 80, 20. 80% you're going to love of the [OCCUPATION]. 20% is probably not what you want. And it's just the way it goes with fifth wheels, trailers, big [OCCUPATION], everything. But if you can get 80% that you like and love with a [MARITAL_STATUS] agreeing. That's probably the right [OCCUPATION], right? I gotcha. It's just. It's explained that in a nice way because it's hard to get exactly what you want. It really is. Okay, and one [PERSON_NAME] quick thing. That [MONEY_AMOUNT], was that you that had the bus, the Allegro bus, that was a 37p or something like that PA or something. I think it was a fate I was looking at. Let me see real quick. Maybe it was a different. I just thought I had a Phaeton, which is a really nice fate. And that's a 36 sh and the low [MONEY_AMOUNT], it's only got 19000 miles. Yeah, that must have been a different deal. I got a magazine, I looked through a bunch of them, but. Gotcha. Yeah, it's tough up here because even. Even private sale, the closest one I've ever seen is [LOCATION]. It was for sale and it was a [ORGANIZATION] just like this one. But it was silver and blue and beautiful. But you know, for a private sale I have to sell mine up up here in the [LOCATION] that you don't see the big diesels [OCCUPATION] don't have. Yeah, correct. Can't has the Thors and stuff. And I don't want a 4. No, I agree with you. It's just they're built different, you know. It is what it is, you know. Yeah. All right, email me that form and I'll. I'll work on it. Okay. And then we'll talk soon. Thanks. Thanks for the time, [PERSON_NAME]. All right, thank you.

Okay, and then what zip code would the vehicle be registered to? It's probably going to be in [LOCATION]. Probably in [LOCATION], Yeah. Okay, just want to let you know, for out of state policy, I don't know if we are doing any financing or leasing out of state. I know that you were open to either. So it might be cash. I don't even know if we're going to be able to do an out of state deal. I would have to double check with one of our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] on that. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME] is all Right. For me? Yeah, [PERSON_NAME], you're right. What do you sell the G63s for? Usually we do have a markup on them. I'm only an [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] would have to go over the markups on the vehicles. Okay. Do you have any rough estimate just so I can get an idea? Because if it's like [MONEY_AMOUNT] over, I'm not really interested. I don't believe it's that high over for a markup, but I would have to get one of them on the line. I don't have any estimates on the markups. Okay, can you get someone on the line maybe? Yeah, absolutely. I could do that for you. Yeah, that would be great. Okay, give me one moment.

So probably your [OCCUPATION] told you that I'm looking for a D63 and I was wondering what your markup on. Depends if you're local to us or not. Where do you live? I live in [LOCATION] right now, but the car is going to be registered either in [LOCATION] or [LOCATION]. Okay. For out of state, we are selling this for [MONEY_AMOUNT] over [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Over. Okay. And in state? In state, we are going all the way to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Yeah. So basically I was looking for an [NATIONALITY] gray one. And you would have been to give me like a better deal. I would be ready to put a deposit on it. Like right now there's only. [PERSON_NAME] you said your name is, right? Yeah, [PERSON_NAME]. That's not a problem. We can. I mean, obviously I can go ahead and discuss if you're not too far off. The only other issue. I don't know if neni I'll explain to you or not after [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. So many rules have changed. And for again, the other problem for out of state are [PHONE_NUMBER] things. A, it has to be a cash only transaction. B, we have to. If you want. Yeah, okay. Also, we can. We should do the shipping ourselves to the customer. We don't. We are not if you know a, you know, ship. I mean, if you allow us, we'll take care of the rest. Yeah, that's completely all right for me. Okay, so let me go ahead and find you an [NATIONALITY] grade just to see if I have any or not. I know I have a 63 black matte, which I don't know if you're interested or not. I have those and let me see. And I have a white with red interior. Right now it's not on the site yet. I have to double check to make sure if it's not sold yet. But I have a matte white with red. I have that matte black with black interior. I have to check to see if there isn't any [NATIONALITY] gray coming in. Okay. So basically, besides the [NATIONALITY] gray One that I'm 100% interested in, if you can do me sticker price and [MONEY_AMOUNT] over for any of those that you said before, I'm ready to take one of them as well. I put a default on that one as well. And also have the raven gray do me a favor. I'm going to give you my cell phone number. Shoot me a text. Let me go ahead and look around and I will get back to you. Okay. Do you think you can do that in a pretty short time? Because I'm looking to put all the points on something today. Yeah, yeah, I'll get back to you today for sure. Okay. What's your number? Okay. And the name? Yes, I'm here. Am I [PERSON_NAME]. Just okay? Yes, just shoot me a text and I'll go from there. Okay, my friend. All right, thank you. I'm also interested if you can get me a good deal besides those [PHONE_NUMBER] G63s. I would also be interested to take GLS450 if you have that black one. If you can get me that as well. I'm down to buy all three of them. Okay, I'll let you know. Okay. I should. Not a problem. Sounds great, my friend. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. Thank you.

It was bring your mascot to work day. Take a look. Hey. We're going to mess up the world. Great, amazing day. So much fun. That was great. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. I was. I thought he went to get [PERSON_NAME], but [PERSON_NAME] is not available. I need a application so I can do it online. I spoke to [PERSON_NAME]. I thought he was going to send it to my email, but I. I don't see it. Yeah. Is that you? My name's [PERSON_NAME]. I'm the. [PERSON_NAME] my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. I'm going to be the one that's helping out. He was just helped me out a little bit earlier. Let me grab. Yes, ma' am. I will get that sent over to you right now. I have a. Yeah, I had an email address on file. Let me see which email address I have on file real quick and then we'll see if that one is the one that you want me to send it to. And then I can get that over to you here real quick. Okay. So it looks like I've got aol. Yeah. How are you spelling the stiff? St. Well, it's. It was put in when the inquiry was put in, so it's. And then I th. Yeah, but those two, that's one word all together. No space between the two words. Yeah. Okay. So [PERSON_NAME], can I get you your number so in case I don't get it I can call you back? Yes, ma' am, you can. Whenever you're ready. All right. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay, let me ask you this. Do you have to be making a certain amount of money to get a car? Now I told you know that I got a car to trade in. Now I had the title in my hand, but I never went to the. My name is on the title in the front. They typed it in. The man that gave it to me type gave him my name and his name and he gave me the car. So I haven't been to the [ORGANIZATION] and it's not a pretty car. It's just a [DATE_INTERVAL] docked caravan. Do you think they would take that as a trade? I told [PERSON_NAME] about it, you know. Yeah, so we do. We'll take in any trade, any vehicle that you have for trade and we, we will do that for you. A really good looking car. No, we, we take in anything. It's. It does not matter to us. So. Yeah, well, hallelujah. Yeah. Now do I need to do something with this title? Should I go up to [ORGANIZATION] and tell them to transfer or can you all do that or should I just hold it until you see the title and you can tell me what to do with it? You think so? Is. And you said the title is in your name, correct? It's on the front of the title. My name and the original owner's name. Yeah. Gotcha. Did he, did he sign everything? Yeah, on the back. He did, yeah. Yeah. So we will just need that to. And you can just kind of. You can go in, just schedule an appointment with them and go in and they, they will be able to get that taken care of for you. They should be able to just print you one, a new one with your. That just has your name on it. And then we can, we can do it like the [ORGANIZATION]. But if you. The only thing that we would need with from the other owner if you wanted to just keep it like that is we just need his driver's license for you to trade it in. But it's, it'd Be easier if it was just under yours, obviously, because then it's, you know, just kind of a straightforward process. But that. That. Okay. Yeah, not a problem. Yeah. So if you send it back, you know, and insurance, so, you know. Yeah, that's awesome. That's. That's all that is. All we would need is just your name on the title and then driver's license and insurance, and we'll be good to go. Okay. All right, so now let me say this. I'm on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], so I don't give, like, almost a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] a month, but I babysit as well, so I don't know how you're gonna calculate that into my income, you know? Yeah. So what you'll do, I. I'll send you the app here in just a second. What you'll do is you'll put in your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] stuff as your main source of income, and then at the very bottom, it's going to say additional income, and then that's where you'll put in your babysitting job. So you'll be able to put both of those in there. Okay, good. Great. What color is. Where can I go to look at this? [PERSON_NAME]? Is it online? It is, yeah. So I sent you an email with all that stuff, but I don't think it went through. So give me just a little bit. I'm going to go ahead and send you a link so you'll have it, and you'll be able to just click on it and see exactly what it looks like. This is [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION].

So I just wanted to check with you if you. That's covered by the lease in any way or that's on me. Did you buy a warranty with the lease by chance? I don't know. Okay. If you didn't.

Yeah. Yeah, that's the. The closest thing I'd have to that is a Renegade. Okay. Do you. May I ask your name? Sorry. Oh, yeah, of course. It's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME].

Okay, so are you planning to do this with the next one as well? If we can, that'd be great. Awesome. Yeah. So let me see real quick, your appointment today. Okay. I'm going to put it in the system real quick just so I can see if you worked with anyone in the past. All right. Was there any color preference you had, [PERSON_NAME]? Well, it's my [MARITAL_STATUS] car, so I'd have to ask her if she has a preference. I know she's kind of had her eyes on the [ORGANIZATION] Broncos. I don't think that's in the cards for us. Yeah, actually, I'm looking at. It looks like you worked with [PERSON_NAME] last. He is. That was it. [PERSON_NAME]. So I'm going to take down your name and number. And you know, the Renegade situation, I'm going to hand that off to him. Okay, [PERSON_NAME], he'll give you a call here shortly. Okay, that's sound good. All right, I'll talk to you. Bye.

Can I help you? Yeah, I'm just calling to see if you'll have the [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] F. Just one second. Let me check on something real quickly. Just a minute. Okay, I just had to check on that real quickly because we. We do have it here. It's a manual. It only has 33, 30 some thousand miles on it. So it is here. The only thing is it has not been through the shop yet. Anything we take in on, trade or purchase from someone, they all have to go through the shop and get a new inspection sticker put on them and all that sort of thing. So are you here locally or are you. No, I'm out of state. So I was really just calling to see if I could, you know, get some photos and kind of see overall condition. I Know the miles are low. Kind of why I'm calling from the car track. It said it didn't like with the roof and so I didn't know what that. What that entailed. So that there was an accident on the carback and I said damage to the roof. Yeah, whatever it says on the [ORGANIZATION]. I mean, so that's probably been. I mean obviously it's been repaired. I don't know if a tree branch fell on it or what. But the information we have is what's going to be on the [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, but it's. Yeah. So anything that goes through the insurance company will be on the. On the [ORGANIZATION]. Sure, sure. Yeah. So I don't know if you're able to maybe take some pictures and send them to me. Yeah, that's not a problem. And the thing is too is everything will eventually be on our website. We're pretty quick about that and we have a very informative. Anything that. That's why I was asking if you were local because we do offer a lot of different things here. We have free state inspections, free oil and filter changes for life. You just come here and that's. But obviously you're not here so you can't come that far away. But that's why I was asking you that. But it probably with the holiday weekend and we just took that car in, it'll probably go through the shop this week and we have an [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] that comes out here, you know, two, three times a week, snaps, pictures, puts everything and everything will be on there. [ORGANIZATION], the shop door, what we did to get it ready for the lot once it goes through and all that and then all the pictures and stuff like that. But if you want pictures before that, I'm more than happy to snap a few and email them to you if you want. Is this the best phone number? Yeah, this is my cell number. Okay. And what's, what's your full name? I'm so sorry. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. And your name is. You're good. My name is [PERSON_NAME].

I'll give you a call and let you know and. Yeah, that'd be great. I just want to know kind of overall condition, like body paint, engine, interior, just to see if it's something. If it's really, really clean and. Yeah, yeah, actually it is. I was talking to one of my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] who actually took it in on trade, and the reason it has so low miles is it just wasn't their daily commuter car. It was just kind of a little fun car they had and just decided they didn't need it anymore. So that's why there's something so low mileage on there. But. All right, [PERSON_NAME]. Well, my name's [PERSON_NAME]. My last name is [PERSON_NAME]. It's much easier to remember the last letter of the Alphabet because we have a couple. [PERSON_NAME] here.

So you have a second? Yeah, I sure do. Cool. Okay. So I. I believe she told you I'm. I'm turning my equinox in and I would like to get a blaze. Correct. Yep. Okay. And she said that there was like a. The color that she was looking at that. That we both kind of really liked was sterling gray. She said that you might. Yeah, I have one. One that's doing. I got the venom already. It just has, you know, hasn't got here yet. It's in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. Drop off the train at. Oh, okay. So I wanted to call to see. We're kind of. We're kind of tied up this [DURATION], but I need to. I need to be able to come in. I. I gotta. I gotta turn it in. So we're gonna have to find time, but I wanted to see if I could do a quick inquiry, rates over the line with you and then talk that over. Since she's at work. We kind of discussed that tonight. Okay. As I was checking on some of the rates. Yeah, not a problem. The one. I got company. You have the employee discount, if I could, I'm correct, right? Yeah. Yep. And then how many miles [DURATION] [DURATION] do you want? I need 15. 15. Okay. Yeah. Now, are you looking just to put your up fronts down or are you looking to put money down on the vehicle? I guess probably. That's what I'm thinking. Maybe. I don't know. But you might have, like that you might have equity in your vehicle, in your Eclipse. Yeah, I May, I think it's got right around 27 or 28,000 miles on it. There's a tiny dents on the hatchback just above the license plate. So I don't know if that affects anything or what that is. But that, that's definitely got to come back. And so I wanted to see, I guess we would put, you know, we definitely could put something down. I just, I just wanted to see if you put this down like I could expect for how many [DURATION], you know. Yeah, I can go [DURATION] [DURATION]. I can go [DURATION] [DURATION], [DURATION]. It just really depends, you know. If you put something down, your payments could be lower at [DURATION] [DURATION] and at [DURATION] [DURATION], if you want to stretch it out, have the lowest payment without putting anything down. [MONEY_AMOUNT], they'll give you your lowest payment for you. Okay, well what, what are we thinking? What, what could you do as far as I guess just shoot me some, shoot me some numbers so I can discuss it with her tonight if you can. Yeah, yeah, let me look at a couple of them offers. Okay. And I'll send to you, I'll email it to you. Okay. Do you, do you want my email then? Yeah, I got your [MARITAL_STATUS]. She said. Oh yeah, she did. Yeah, she did. If you, you can send them to her.

When you think because we're open late Monday night and Thursday night till [TIME]. Okay. If those are late nights, we could. Thursday would probably be better then because [PERSON_NAME] doesn't get off and I, I know she's going to want to be there with all of us too. She doesn't get off until [TIME]. Wait, you're in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], right? No, we're in [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]. Okay, well what, how late on Monday until [TIME]? I can be here till [TIME].

Yeah, I will look forward to an email and hopefully we can get something done this [DURATION] until wheel works of the. Because we all pay with the [ORGANIZATION] employee discount. Your price is set by [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. They tell me exactly what to sell to you for the terms and the you know, the miles is the only thing we have to look at. And then look at your vehicle and see what I can get you out of your vehicle and see if we have any can put some equity in it. Okay, perfect. Okay, that works for me before I leave today. Awesome. I appreciate it. I look forward to it. And then we will be in touch. Okay. And like I said, what I have come in is a sterling gray. It's got the safety in the confidence package which gives us, you know, the remote start adhesives, the power liftgate, the blindside mirrors and all that stuff there stand development my packages. Okay. And that's what I. Okay, that's what. That's what. I didn't even ask but that's what [PERSON_NAME]. Mm. I said if it works for you, give me a call as early as you can on Monday. So yeah, they come in. They pretty well sold by time to get here. Really with inventories are and we can set something up. Okay. Yeah, well, absolutely, I will.

"Thanks for choosing [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I assist you? Hello. I just had a question. Sure. So I was wondering if you guys had a Camaro. [DATE_INTERVAL], ZL1. The only ZL1 Camaro I have is the [DATE_INTERVAL]. And it's a convertible? Yes. Are you looking for a coupe? Convertible. It was just a convertible, you said? Yes. What color is it? Automatic trim? It's white. White. So are you guys receiving any more or is that just the one? You guys, I'm expecting [DURATION] [DURATION] more. Let me see. I have a coupe coming in. Let me see here. I can tell you when it's supposed to be here. It's currently on the website, the vehicle details. But let me give you an ETA when it'll be arriving. Okay. I think it's going to be [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. Let me just double check. [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yeah, let me see here. I just got to double check. So I know we have some SS coming in. Gotta make sure. Give me a second. Sorry. Computer system is a little bit slower than normal. It'll be here [DATE] [DATE]. So it looks like next [DURATION] or. No. Yeah, it'll be Tuesday. Like [DURATION] [DURATION] and [DURATION] [DURATION] and [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Oh, cool. Yeah, I'm interested in getting one. All right, let me see. Do you have any particular color or are you open? Well, what's the that color gonna be? It's gonna be white with a jet black interior. Yeah, that's cool. As long as it's like coupy enough. I'm not really into convertible. Yeah, yeah, no, convertible is a. For an old man car. Yeah, I was wondering. Yeah, like, I don't know. An appointment for me. Yeah, just give me a second. Yeah. So I'll make sure it's automatic transmission. Is that okay? Yes. Okay. And then our price on that is going to be [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes, sounds good. Okay. I can take a deposit to hold the car for you or you can just wait until it gets here. But there's no guarantee it'll be available by that time. But that's completely up to you. I'll leave that to all the customers that's inquired about it. What was the first option or what? I said I can take a deposit for you. Deposit is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] and it does go towards the purchase of the vehicle, but it just. It also guarantees the. The vehicle for you. Oh, yeah, that'll be cool. All right. Sorry, I'm just pulling this up. Do you have time to come in today or do you like to do everything via email? Maybe like. So it's arriving Tuesday you said? Right. Well it'll be right. It's not this coming Tuesday? The following Tuesday. Okay. Maybe like Friday or Saturday of next [DURATION]. Yes, Yeah, I can absolutely do that. Do you want me to maybe check back with you on this coming Monday? Oh yeah. Or do you want to come in and I mean I can, I can do the deposit over the phone or, or I can do it via email or you can do it in person. It's completely entirely up to you. Yeah, I would like to do it in person. Okay. It's just that we need far so like we're actually want to like close the day so we want to make sure like we actually get it. Well yeah, that's what I recommend doing. Yes. Okay. What did you need for the deposit? The deposit? I think we'll do it in person. Okay. You said you guys live far where you guys live? Close to [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay, so you guys are going to drive all the way down here to do the posit just to drive back again on the following Tuesday? It's just a lot of driving. I'm just trying to save you guys some time. Let's see. The only reason I suggest because it's. Yeah, because it's a little bit. It's just a lot of driving. So let me explain kind of how it works. So the car is slated to be here on the [DATE] and then once the car gets delivered, it needs to go through a pre delivery inspection and that can take up to [DURATION] [DURATION] to get completed. So just because the car gets delivered on the [DATE] doesn't mean it's going to be available right away. It's still got to pass the inspection that we put it through to make sure everything's exactly where it needs to be. And at that time then we'll go ahead and put the car out to sell. Now if you already have a deposit on the car, the car will never hit the lot. It will just stay in the back until you guys take it up. But with that being said, deposit can be processed via a debit card or you can use a credit card. And on the credit card There is a [PHONE_NUMBER] service charge to use a credit, so I always advise to use debit. So you can save yourself [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] but I will leave that option up to you. Yeah, for sure. Okay, is the number that you called in at, is that a [PHONE_NUMBER] one? Yes. What I can do is I can text you my information and then from there I can also leave my email address and we can communicate that way all I would need is a copy of the driver's license. And if you want to give me the debit or credit card number over the phone, I can process the payment for you. Then I'll send you off the receipt, and then your Camaro will be reserved for you. Okay. And this dealership is located in [LOCATION], right? Correct. We're at [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. We're off the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] in [LOCATION]. I'll also attach the dealership address so you can know exactly where it's at. Okay, cool. Yeah, that sounds good. And your name is? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How do I spell that? [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And can you definitely get the appropriate spelling? Oh, in my last name or first? I just want to make sure I have it right. So can you spell it for me? [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. And then my last name. I thought it was. Oh, yeah, go ahead. Last name, too? Yeah. Last name, please. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. One more time. It broke up just a little bit. It's probably on my end. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. All right. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. All right, well, nice to meet you, [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. What I'll do is I'm going to go ahead and put you into our system and I'll create a profile for you, and then I'll send you off my information via text. And then if you just want to communicate with me via email or text, whatever you'd like to do, you can even just send me the picture of the driver's license via text. And then I can call back when you guys are ready to proceed with the deposit and I can just collect that information over the phone and I'll send you. Yeah. All right, cool. So when did you. Just to touch base, just so I know for my calendar purposes, when did you want to proceed with deposit? You want to do that on Friday, the deposit? Yeah, I mean, I can do it now. It's up to you. Yeah. On Friday. Okay. That works. Yes. Okay, I will let you know. It is a first come, first serve. So if someone was to call in before the Friday as you stated, they would have first rights to the vehicle. Okay. Yeah, I think we'll make the cost first. Yeah, I just need like the information and. Yeah, what I'll do is I'll print out this, the window sticker for you so you can review it and I'll send that in the text so you can review everything before you proceed with the deposit to make sure everything looks good to you?

Was there any particular reason why you were looking to trade it in so soon? Just kind of lifestyle change. Looking to try to get a house coming up and different stuff like that. So I'm just trying to consolidate like all my finances and just get rid of anything extra right now. It just happens to be an extra. Gotcha. Okay, let me put you on a quick hold. Okay. Okay. Sa. Hi, [OCCUPATION]. Yes. Okay, I just spoke with [PERSON_NAME] real quick. He wants to know when you were looking to stop in to have it appraised. It'll probably be later on this [DURATION]. Thursday possibly. I think he's actually off on Thursdays. He is. Do you want to set something for Friday maybe? Sure, I can do that. Okay. What time on Friday so I can let him know. Is Friday morning good sometime, but early Friday morning? Sure. [PERSON_NAME] comes in at [TIME] on Friday, so I'll let him know you'll be in Friday morning. Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

"Good afternoon, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Can I help you? Yeah, [PERSON_NAME], I was trying to get a hold of [PERSON_NAME]. Is he in today or. Yes, one second, please. And local [OCCUPATION] to help you find competitive financing options. And now is a great time to buy a vehicle. We have a great selection of new and used vehicles with some of the most aggressive pricing we've seen. Seen in [DURATION]. Hello, this is [PERSON_NAME] at [ORGANIZATION]. Hey, [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] here. Yep. Can you hear me? What was that? Hello? Hey, I can hear you. Yeah, you can hear me, [PERSON_NAME]. All right, awesome. Sounds like you've been. Sounds good. Sounds like you've been talking to my mother. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] stopped in, saw Highlander limited here yesterday. She basically wanted me to call back and I think he left her voicemail today. But check in, see the deep, you know, kind of work out all the fine details and see what you guys are doing. You were mentioning to her some sort of sale before the end of the month, etc. Etc. But long story short, she wants to figure all that out. I've got this thing pulled up online on your website and I guess just wanted to run through the fine details with you if you're the guy to chat to. Yeah, absolutely. So we have seven more new cars to be. We have seven more new cars to be able to sell by the end of the month to hit our goal. So we don't have like a set [MONEY_AMOUNT] amount to discount off of it. It's just kind of like a case by case scenario. The customer that's getting the best deal is the one who's here. But we are wheeling and dealing on all of our new cars because like I said, at the start of the day we had seven more to sell to hit our goal. I think we have three. So two or three so far today. But we definitely wanted to try and earn a business. You bet. So quick question. So questions. We'll just roll through them real fast. Financing, you guys. I think she was talking about some sort of promotional financing. Anything like that going on? If so, what are the terms and what are the, I guess, stipulations as far as how fast can she pay at all? Yeah. So I believe I'd have to double check with my [OCCUPATION], but I believe right now the incentivized rate on The Highlander is [MONEY_AMOUNT] at [DURATION] [DURATION], [MONEY_AMOUNT] at [DURATION] [DURATION], or [MONEY_AMOUNT] at [DURATION]. And then she could pay it off. No prepayment, no early payoff fees on any of our loans? Nope. Okay, sounds good. Okay. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. So she might be interested in doing that. That's just going to be a case by case webinars to you guys. If it works for you guys or not. Make the deal. Okay. And then let's see here. Basically the next thing is trying to get the true out the door and then figuring out what we can do. So I see. Yes. Online. You got it. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And basically I'm curious with you what doc fees, title fees, finance charges, yada yada yada that you guys are have on there. So basically trying to get to what's the true out the door. Yep. So if you scroll to the bottom of the page, it'll show that our documentation fee is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then there is one other accessory on the vehicle that is not listed on the website and that costs [MONEY_AMOUNT]. If you look on the website, you'll see the vehicle price and then accessories for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, so what is it? What's on there? Got it. So the accessory that's listed on the website is a rear end collision avoidance system that makes the third taillight flash four times every time you hit the brakes. Because the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] has determined [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of reaction time can prevent 60% of rear end collision. And then the other one is an interior and exterior protection package that lasts for [DURATION] [DURATION]. Gotcha. And that's to the tune of [MONEY_AMOUNT] is what you guys are charging on that. Yep. And then our documentation fee. So between the two accessories and the documentation comes to a total of [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But like I said, the last day of the month and this is the best day to try and work a deal, you know? Sure. Well, I mean we'll be real playing forward with you here. Yeah. If you have something and you guys can use finance or not finance, it can be cash or finance. Could be whatever. Whatever works best for you guys to make this deal happen. But basically looking for a true out the door. You guys got [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then she'll drive up right now and buy it. Okay, sounds good. Well, I had the best way for me to place that offer is to have to have her here. Does she live here in [LOCATION] or she doesn't. No, she's kind of. She'd be coming from [LOCATION]. So this is a. Yeah, we're not hitting the road unless this is a dumb thing, Right? For sure, for sure. So I'm the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] here. I was actually calling on behalf of my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [PERSON_NAME], but I will, I will fill him in and let him know that you want to offer the [MONEY_AMOUNT] for that out the door. And then he'll see if that can work for the [OCCUPATION]. And we'll see if we can get you down here from [LOCATION] today. Yeah, sounds good. All right. We'll have a. We'll have one of us give you a call back. Okay, sounds good. All right, sounds good. Bye. Bye. One.",success,price_quote,Highlander,high,False,0cbfb0cefb894690b090e037cfc3e240_transcript.json

Okay, I know we have a few Tellurides coming in. I want to say next week, mid to end week. And then we do have different trend levels coming out. What I could do is as soon as they come in, give you a call and then have my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] just compare all of them side by side for you. Is that okay? Sure. I mean, I'd love to just even test one. I haven't driven one yet. Okay, so you haven't test driven one? No. That would be a really good experience for you, right? That's the goal.

I was just on the other line, so thanks for giving me a call. Of course. So was it the sortoring you're looking for in the crv, [PERSON_NAME]? Yeah. So let me just, I guess, provide a little background. I would be looking to lease a car at, you know, the end of the month or beginning of next month. Just bought a house in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION], but I don't move down there for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, I got you. Where are you moving from? Most people here are from somewhere else. Me included. Yes, yes. We're coming from [LOCATION] [LOCATION], just outside of [LOCATION]. How about you? I moved here from the [LOCATION]. Okay. Yeah, Yeah. I would take [MONEY_AMOUNT] out your way. Yeah. Yes, sir, that's correct. Well, awesome. Welcome to [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. When you get here, of course. But, you know, I. The first [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] that I was here, you know, the heat with the heat, you could have dared me to move back. But, you know, it was a good opportunity for my [MARITAL_STATUS] with her promotion, and I've been with [ORGANIZATION] a very long time, and, you know, I visited four [ORGANIZATION] dealerships in this area before I decided on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. They really had the best reviews online. The longest longevity of employees really, you know, says a lot about a company. So that's kind of how I've ended here. But, yeah, it's a good company. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] owns [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] as well as 100 plus other franchises. But, yeah, I made a good move here and very happy so far in [DATE_INTERVAL]. Good. Oh, okay. That's still somewhat recently. Mm. So end of this month, beginning of next month. Where did you purchase that, [PERSON_NAME]? [LOCATION]. Here. Locally? No, a little farther away. We purchased at [LOCATION], just outside of [LOCATION]. Newer development. Yeah. Awesome. Well, congrats to be there and working in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay, great. Let's see here. End of this month, what do I have coming? Sport Touring. Are you flexible on color? I am. I like the one you sent, but I am definitely flexible. Okay. Looks like I have a gray one or a blue one that should be here around that time. Yeah. With the two that I have, I know they're going to get sold relatively quickly. So I'm just kind of looking ahead for your time frame and it looks like that. This gray one, I could send you a link to this one maybe. I have a VIN number. Yeah, I might be able to pull that one up and send it to you. How many [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] do you think you'll need for this? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right. Do you plan on trading anything, [PERSON_NAME]? No, I have a [ORGANIZATION] 3 Series that's coming off lease here that I will, I guess, turn in here and then start fresh down there. All right, so it sounds like you need to get this all lined up and make sure you have the vehicle secured and all the details and all that stuff coming down here. Putting a lot of trust in the local [OCCUPATION] here so that it can be secured for you. Sound about right? Yeah. You know, my [MARITAL_STATUS] has the minivan, so, you know, we won't be completely on foot, but having better. No, no, no biking for me. Okay, here's what I'll do. I'm going to do two things. When we hang up, I'm going to send you a link to this vehicle. Check it out. Let me know if that'll work for you. I'll also work up a lease for you. [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles per [DURATION]. Do you have an amount in mind that you'd like to put down or a monthly payment budget that we can try to kind of back into with X amount of [MONEY_AMOUNT] down or. What were your thoughts there? Yeah, so I. The car is going to be leased through my company. So I have to, you know, I guess, you know, what I would need from you in terms of. I know some people ask for a corporate resolution that's a little difficult. I'm the [OCCUPATION] of the company. I could bring in some information on that. But I guess all that to say ultimately at some point I need to get the final blessing, if you will, from the rest of the team. But yeah, I mean, I'm seeing, you know, that the PRV is somewhere in the [MONEY_AMOUNT] range, you know, money down and with trim. So, you know, somewhere around there probably. Okay. So I can give you [DURATION] [DURATION] options, you know, kind of tailored around that [MONEY_AMOUNT], you know, with money down, maybe, you know, throw in [DURATION] [DURATION] options with, you know, a little more, a little less kind of range it a little bit and you could take a look and, you know, show it to the powers that be and then let me know your thoughts. And if you'd like to secure a vehicle, I'm happy to help. Great. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. You're welcome. So, yeah, you've already got my last. Expect something from me a little bit later today and then I'll follow up with you and see what your thoughts are. And if we can help in any other way moving forward, I'm glad to do so. Great.

Because I want to say we're still able to put in an order for. Let me check that. Okay. So it looks like for the heavy duties, we would have to do an order for a [DATE_INTERVAL], not a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Let me see. The only thing I would say with that is we currently don't have any pricing for the heavy duties on those. Right. Typically what I tell people is for every model year, it does go up about 2 to 3% of the MSRP. So, I mean, it maybe went up another [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] to, you know, $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. It really just depends. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, I would much rather say that than say, oh, yeah, you know, just $[MONEY_AMOUNT] max. And then it comes back, you know, at $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right? No. You know, yeah. So with that, he said that you guys don't do any kind of [OCCUPATION] trades or locates or anything? Unfortunately, no [OCCUPATION] trades because a lot of times if we reach out to someone, you know, very popular, sought after truck, they're gonna be like, no, we're not. Right. So that's kind of the only biggest thing is what they want in return is, you know, what we're not willing to give and then vice versa. No, I got you. Yeah. So. Okay, well, hold on one second. Let me check this one more time. See what we just have coming in real fast. Okay. No, no hurry. Yeah, so there's that. Okay, so once again, these are just 1 tons. Now are you looking for like a [OCCUPATION] or anything like that? A big horn. A big horn. Okay. Because I could have swore we actually had one out here. I'm just checking. Nope, not that one. Not that one. Not that one. Okay. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Taken forever for me to find this. Okay, here we go. Night Edition. Okay, so as it looks right now we do have a granite crystal, 2500 one ton bighorn with the eight foot box. 2500 one ton. That's, that's a three quarter ton. Oh my God. I don't know what I was looking at the [DATE_INTERVAL] right there and my brain had a little [INJURY]. Yep. So it is a one ton. I, for some reason. Okay. And it's not a dually. It just has that long box. Perfect. And it's a Night Edition. It is a Night Edition. Yep. Granite crystal as well. And you have one on the lot. That's what it's showing me right now. Yeah. Wow. Can you, can you verify that? Because I'd be very interested in that. Absolutely. Now, [PERSON_NAME], let me get a good, good contact number because I definitely want to, you know, make sure I have this number because I'll just run out there real fast because it's showing me it is on the lot currently right now. There's no deposit on it or anything. Okay. Yeah, that'd be good. And it's a 20, [DATE_INTERVAL] long night edition Bighorn, man. It sounds, it sounds like what I'm looking for. And if it doesn't have every single thing I'm looking for, I may not be super. But yeah, right now it's kind of get what you can get. Right. I think it's. Yeah, I mean, it's, I'm searching around for that particular color and enter a dealership that kind of wants to work a little bit with you, you know, because a lot of guys are just MSRP and it's kind of hard. And I live in [LOCATION], so I would, I would fly out to [LOCATION] and kind of drive it home. Absolutely. No, I totally get where you're coming from. And I, I, right now I got you on the phone. I'm also just checking to see what else we got otherwise, because you Know, it's nice having a few options, right? Absolutely. And, I mean, I'm not in a huge hurry, but I'm kind of. I just got rid of my [DATE_INTERVAL]. I. I have a vehicle that I drive. I'm a [OCCUPATION]. I have a vehicle that I drive. It's getting me by. Okay. And I just. My [DATE_INTERVAL] was the Granite crystal Night Edition. Same truck, basically. And, you know, I keep them. I keep them [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], and I just kind of roll them over and get. Get into new ones. So I really love, love that truck, that color. So that's kind of why I'm looking for that same one. Absolutely. And then so there's that one. Let's check this real fast. It's always nice to see what else we got. I'll break it down by colors. Let's see what. Granite, crystal. Okay, so we got some of those. Night Edition. Okay, let's see. We only have one of those. Yep. So that looks to be the only one we have. Is that one ton? The only one we have close to that is a build that a customer did. Gotcha. Yeah, he's probably not gonna back out of that, I'm sure. Oh, you would be surprised. A lot of people call us, like, every day. Hey, has my truck got there yet? Has it got there yet? Yeah, yeah, I know. I bet. Now, are you by chance on our website there, [PERSON_NAME]? I am not right now, no. Because I could find. I couldn't find it on your website. I only found. I think it was a black one, maybe on the website. Okay, yeah. Because what I'll do is that number you're calling from that to [PHONE_NUMBER], is that a good number for you? Yes, sir. Yep. Okay, so what I'll do is I'll run out there, I'll put hands on it just to verify that. Hey, it's here. But I will also send you a text from my personal phone with that truck to our link. Perfect. Take a photo of it too, for me. Yeah, that I can do for you. Other than that, [PERSON_NAME], do you have any questions for me? Anything like that? If you can, if it is what it is, take a photo, send me a photo. And I'd love to see, you know, what options it does have, what it all has. So I don't know, there's a sheet that you could email me, or I don't know if the window sticker tells everything, but, you know, I could take a picture of that window sticker and send it to you as well. Okay. Yeah, that'd be great. Perfect. Yeah. Awesome. Well, other than that, I got excited, too. Don't worry. Yeah. Now we don't have anything. I know. So now I just want to throw this out there. If this is the truck you do end up wanting, Are you wanting to do a deposit on that? I might. If I look it over, I might call you. I'm going to call you back tomorrow and say, let's do this thing. Absolutely. Perfect. Awesome. No, that's totally fine. I will head right out there right now. So you'll be getting my text here [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. And my other question was, I'm a big cab light guy, and chances are it may not have cab light. Is that something that your facility can add factory? Absolutely. Okay, good. Yep. One of the things I love about [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is we are able to do everything here in store. So we're able to get cab lights. We've done crazy, crazy builds on these trucks. We've had people put on fender flares, the automatic power board spray, and bed liner, or even like a fifth wheel setup. We're able to do it all. Okay. Perfect. Yeah. I mean, I'm a big cab light guy. And like my last, I think my last, my [DATE_INTERVAL] and my [DATE_INTERVAL], when I bought it, I was dealing with [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] at the time. They did the same thing. They put the factory installed cab lights on it for me before I even picked it up. So that's. That's kind of a must. And the only other thing I would. I would probably have you guys do other than the bed liner, is maybe a sliding rear window. If this one didn't have it with this one being a Laramie. I want to say it. Yep, it has it. Oh. Oh. It's a Laramie. Oh, no, it's a big horn. It is a big horn. Goodness. Okay. My brain's all over the right. Right now, [PERSON_NAME]. If it doesn't have the slide rear window, it's not going to break your deal. I'll tell you that. It does have one. I'm looking at the pictures right now. I just need to go verify that it is out here. All right. I'm gonna let you go so perfectly. Whatever you want to do. Awesome. Well, hey, well, expect to hear from me here shortly. Okay. Okay. All right. That is correct. Yes, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. All right, [PERSON_NAME], I'll talk to you. Perfect. Hey, thank you. Bye. You bet.",success,inventory_check,2500 Bighorn,medium,False,0ce96b9b571646d2b2d99e3a2aec1f9e_transcript.json

I'm the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] for the dealership. Oh, okay. Yes. On a take hand. Yes, sir. So it shows that there's a. I don't see it on your website.

It's a black with red interior and it's a Performance battery plus. Hold on one sec. You're calling me from [ORGANIZATION]? Yes. Is that [PERSON_NAME]? I work with him. Yes, for him. Do you know [PERSON_NAME]? Yeah, actually he probably doesn't know me, but we've done many, many, many, many, many deals. Oh, really? How? Yeah, where were you working? [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and now here. Okay, cool. Okay. You said, do you have the last of the bin? Oh, you said. Yeah. What was the last of the bin? Actually, I can tell you it's [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay, stand by. I got a lot of these. Just give me a sec. Yeah, they're all just like sitting at the port. Yeah. So it looks like 11810118. I know I have a black one. All right, but this one's like specific. He has to have red and he's got to have that performance battery plus thing. Okay. So I found. Should be here actually next month. Next month. Okay, what's the status on it? But it's good. No, no, it's just a port or is it shift or. No, no, it's going to be at the port in probably [DURATION] [DURATION] and then it's supposed to be here at the dealership on [DATE] and then. But that's barring maybe any delays for. Because of the whole battery thing where you can't start the car. Or is that like. Has that been fixed or is that still just going to. I'm not showing any. Anything open on this car. Okay, you're saying it's supposed to arrive [TIME]? Yes. Okay, so just for me, maybe I'll see what this client wants to do. But other clients [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. What are you guys doing on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? They're usually sticker. Okay. So I think though, I have a black one with red interior with the, with the performance on the ground. What's the MSRP on that one? I'm. I'm trying to pull it up right now. Just give me one second. There should be. Is that like the [DATE_INTERVAL] fake car? I'm going to tell you in just a second. It. Sorry, just give me a second. I'm not seeing it anymore. I'm wondering if they sold it. Black here's. Black here's. Maybe it's this one. Hold on. Oh, no, this isn't. No, I'm not finding it. So they might. Maybe they just sold it. Got it. So. Yes, because it shows two other ones on your website. It's got the [DATE_INTERVAL] with engine [VEHICLE_ID]. I think. I think the other one he probably won't want because it just has the base rims. It's like a 105k car. So I don't think he'll take that car. It's got to be red interior, right? Yep. Yeah. No, I don't. The other ones are incoming as well. The other ones are incoming. When's that other cost supposed to come in? The [DATE_INTERVAL], what I just gave you. What was the last few. Divid. [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay, one second. It. No, this one's not until [DATE_INTERVAL]. Oh, geez. Yeah, this one is one of the battery issue ones. Got it. Okay. All right. Let me talk to the client, and then maybe. Maybe we can see if what you want to do maybe on that [MONEY_AMOUNT] car and. But you're saying your best is MSRP on these cars? Yeah, we're gonna be there. Got it. Okay. I just could have a [OCCUPATION]. A couple deals are doing a [MONEY_AMOUNT] or [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] below, but. Okay, and then what. What about, like, Panamera? Okay. What do you do? What am I doing on Panameras? Yeah, whatever. Whatever. I need to. Let me see what you have. Let me see what you have. Do you have something on a Panamera? I might have a client on a Panamera.

Okay, cool. Well, what I'll do is I'll get you in our TRM system and then we'll create sounds like buyer's order. Where are you located? I'm in [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]. Okay. And then, you know, you'll have my direct contact info and any questions you have. What I can do also is I'll lay an eyeball on the vehicle and I'll take a couple of better pictures and maybe a video, walk around and pop it out your way. Okay. And I've got to run out a little bit. What kind of. What time frame are you looking at? I'll do this probably in about the next [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. All right. And I also need to know the. I would assume the rest of the factory warranty. Correct? Right, of course. Okay. And does that. Does that start from manufacture date or when it was first titled or how does that work? Yeah, it starts from when it was first titled. So let me take a look real quick here. I can probably pull that up. I'll do the [ORGANIZATION] warranty check. Looks like on the three, on the 36,000 mile, the [DURATION], [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] are left or 31,000 miles. And then on the drive train, you got [DURATION] [DURATION] or 55,000 miles. So there's a ton of warranty still left. Okay. All right, Good deal. And the only other thing, let's see from the. Do you know if this was the premium or the. And I'm not. I think the premium just had, like, leather. And you know what I can do is I have what's called an I packet. I'll send this to you. It has the window sticker and all that on it along with and all that. Yeah, I'll pop that to you, too. Okay. All right, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. If you can get that in next little bit, because I got to run out, and that would be helpful. Okay, you got it. I'll work on it right now, brother. All right. Thanks, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, talk to you later. Bye. Bye. Bye.",success,price_quote,Mach 1 Mustang,medium,False,0d0216c73e2b4579aeab6a1f73f68364_transcript.json
"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I assist you? Oh, yes, I was calling to see if you guys still had that [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Silverado, the Crew Cab Sport box, four wheel drive, RST All Star Edition. It's like a [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] truck. Oh, are you currently on our website, or at least I asked, do you have a stock number for this vehicle? Everything bows out, [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it. Well, no, he owed [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it. No, it doesn't. Doesn't show it on the website. On the website. [DATE_INTERVAL] Silverado Crew Cab, Short Box, Four Wheel Drive, RSP Allstar Edition. Yep. All right, so currently I know this is placed at a sister location. Is it your location in [LOCATION]? Yeah, we're actually [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. So this, this is in [LOCATION] currently, however. [LOCATION]. Yeah, it's in [LOCATION] currently. But we can get this vehicle here. That's what you're looking to do? Possibly. I'm just looking at like how many miles. Because it doesn't say how many miles are on it. Like there's like your website, other trucks that you guys, I guess have, like, have a lot more information. So I was just calling to see like, what the. Because it says contact us for the sales price and all that kind of stuff. So I was just trying to get some information. So I bought. I called the [LOCATION] location, Right? Yes. Okay. So I bought. I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Silverado that I bought from you guys, brand new that I would be looking to trade in. And I've only got 25,000 miles on it, so. Oh. Oh, Lord. We want your truck then. So you what? Yeah, and it's got bed liner sprayed in. It came with the bed liner sprayed in and the running board and all that. So. All right, I'll tell you why. I just wanted to know, like, if it would be worth it. Because if I was going to trade my truck in, this is the one I would want. So I just want to know, like, price. Because price, price determines, like I don't want to pay more than I already pay in my car payment from my truck I currently have and all that kind of stuff. So I was just wondering, you know, what sale price actually is. Because obviously it says contact us. I see what MSRP is, but yeah, the MSRP [MONEY_AMOUNT], it looks like they're also putting another additional sale price on this. So, yeah, I would love to get you that information. I'd have to get in contact with that store, their [OCCUPATION]. I'm Actually an [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] here. So I can get the information for you. It would just take a little bit of time on my end trying to get that for you. Yeah, that's fine. Is it all right if I can get a good name and number from you so that way I can let you know? Yeah. So my name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Last name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] Do you remember the guy's name? I bought the truck up there. I know the guy I bought it from still works at your location. He's. He's probably like [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE], [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE], [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] guy? Is he [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]? Is he [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] or is it just cut really, really short? I can't remember his name. It might be [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Was he elder gentleman? How elder? This guy was probably in his [PERSON_AGE]. He had just turned in his truck, I think for a Corvette or something. A Camaro? Yeah. I can't. It's not ringing a bell for some reason. Yeah, I. I know he still. When I just had my. I had something done. What did I have done to my truck? Oh yeah, I had it looked at and he was still there then, so it wasn't too long. I'm pretty sure he still works there, but yes. Well, what I'm seeing from here, it looks like they. They just got this vehicle as a trade. So that's probably the reason they don't have all the information. Maybe not. Yeah, because it's brand new. I don't know. Usually when it says new, but then it looks like it would have been a tray. I don't know. That's why I was calling. I was like, it doesn't make sense. Like, so if it isn't new, I want to know like how many miles it has on it and like what the warranties left, you know, all that kind of stuff. Okay. Yeah. And I'm more than happy to get that information for you. Yeah, just give me a little bit of time on my end so that way I can get in contact with them. Is this a good number to give you a call back on? No, I'll give you my cell phone. I'm on my [MARITAL_STATUS] phone, so it's all right. Sounds good. I'll be giving you a call back here soon.

"[ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I direct your call? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I am on Carguro. I think I pronounced that right. But you have a vehicle that's showing, but you don't have a price on it. I'm trying to find out how much this vehicle is. Okay, let me look that up for you. What vehicle was it? It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] K5 GT line, all wheel drive. Okay, let me look that up real quick. And who I had the pleasure of speaking with. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How are you doing today? Doing good, [PERSON_NAME]. Let's see. All right. TK5 GT line. Okay. It looks like I've only got one, and this one is so. Look, this one's a Passion red. Oh, okay. So this is not even the one you're advertising. What does it say on there? It's like a charcoal color. It's. Oh, no, it says exterior color, Passion red. Why is the picture. Don't say look. Don't even show. That is. Oh, that's because. Yeah, it's got stock photos in there. Because we haven't gotten it pictured here at the dealership yet. That's why. Okay. Yeah, it's a. Yeah, it's a Passion Red, all wheel drive. I don't have a price on that one. That one actually hasn't showed up to the dealership quite yet. Oh, so it's still in transit as of right now. Let me ask you a question. Is it realistic? Okay, the K5s, what was the first [DURATION] that they came out? Do you know? Offhand? I want to say. I want to say it was somewhere around [DATE_INTERVAL] or [DATE_INTERVAL]. Like that. I know it's somewhat of a newer model, if I'm not mistaken, but I'll be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure. Okay, so is it real? So it's not. Is it realistic to think that maybe you can get a [ORGANIZATION] K5 less than [DATE_INTERVAL] [MONEY_AMOUNT]? I would tell you, you can. That GT line, more than likely not, because they're. They're pretty rare. And that's kind of the. It's like the upgraded fully loaded, I think it's like a different engine and powertrain. Like, it's like the sports car style one that they have. I know we just sold a front wheel drive. I think it was yesterday, the day before, and they were. They're going for a premium on those cars. We had somebody from [LOCATION] [LOCATION] call us and offer [MONEY_AMOUNT] over our list price to be able to purchase it because. Because of what it was. What is the [ORGANIZATION] FI. Then what is the [ORGANIZATION] K5? That's down below the GT. What is that called? So you've got, I think there's a couple of different trims. You've got the Stinger, you've got the lxs, you got the lx and I think an Ex, if I'm not mistaken. And it's all the same, similar body style, that sporty look. Yeah, it's all gonna have the same body style. It's just what's in the car. So I want to say like the EX and the LX and all those are just a little more simp, a little less features. But the GT line from my understanding is something that's got like a little bit different engine in it. Like it's turbo boosted, pushes a bunch more horsepower. And then of course they have all the different styling and everything. Yeah, that comes with the interiors and stuff like that. Yeah, the K5s are really popular right now. If I'm not mistaken. I think they replaced the Optima. I think that was what [ORGANIZATION] came out with to replace the Optima model because they seem to be very, very similar. So. Okay, well, I'm gonna still just be looking around and stuff before I'm looking for a car for my daughter. Okay, I got you. Looking to be looking to be under [DATE_INTERVAL] on the price point. Yeah. Yes. We don't want her to. I really was trying to avoid a car note, but it looks like she's got about 10,000 to put down. So if it's going to be a car note, it needs to be a small car note. I gotcha. And is it the K5 that she's looking at exclusively or just kind of in that range of vehicle? Just to kind of range. She's looking for a sporty car and I know that [ORGANIZATION] has A, that K5 is that sporty look she looking and you don't have to pay so much money for a sport looking car. And from my understanding, they're good on gas mileage. Mm. Yeah. I would tell you I do have this one. I do have a [DATE_INTERVAL]. I have a [ORGANIZATION] Elantra SE with like 33,000 miles on it, low miles. And I've got price around [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It would be something I would highly suggest. Yes, ma' am. Yeah, I've got it at [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's something I would highly suggest. I drive a Sonata myself and their sister companies, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], so I know that they've got around the same quality vehicle. And this one, I would like put it this way, I would advocate for it because I drive a Sonata myself, and I get probably 38 to 39 miles to the gallon on my commute to and from work. And I'll tell you this. I drive. I drive. If I go below 80, it's because there's traffic, I have a lead foot, and I get great gas mileage in that car. It's the only reason I've held onto it for so long. So I would highly suggest. Yeah, [ORGANIZATION] as well, because they have a good one. Yes, ma' am. Can you send me the pictures? Yeah, sure, sure. Let me. Let me look at [PERSON_NAME]. So I do show on my. My phone here. I show it. Is that the best number for you? That's the best number. [PERSON_NAME], [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay, let me do this while I got you on the phone, [PERSON_NAME], just real quick. You said. Was it. Was it [PERSON_NAME] with a [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. Okay, not a problem. Yeah. And you said that's a [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yes, ma' am. A [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL]. 33,000 miles on it. Low miles. So let me. Let me say if you look down at your phone, [PERSON_NAME], you're going to see a text message comes through. It says, hi, [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME] over at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Just respond yes to that, and I'll shoot you over a link to the vehicle, be able to take a look at all the pictures, carfax on the car, all that kind of stuff. Okay. Your name is [PERSON_NAME]? Yes, ma' am. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. Mm. Yes, ma' am. And then. And then if you look at it and you go, hey, we want to take, you know, we want to check it out or take it for a spin or whatnot, just text me through there, right, And I'll get that vehicle pulled up front for you, okay?

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today? I'm not sure if I just spoke with you. I don't think so. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I'm calling from [ORGANIZATION] about my [ORGANIZATION]. I don't think you're the same voice as. We got disconnected. Whoever I was speaking with, what I'm reaching out for is I bought a brand new [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION]. That was my second one from you guys. I've loved both of them. My son's [MEDICAL_CONDITION] at [PERSON_AGE], and I have a problem with trying to help someone get him in and out of it. And I love it. But I'm asking right out, since this is my second one. I mean, I paid cash for it and I love it. But what do you have on your. Lot of another type of a car besides a [ORGANIZATION] that we could just trade it for the value of what a [DATE_INTERVAL] is? Yeah, for sure. I can definitely take a look at that. Let me go ahead and let me. And I'm in [ORGANIZATION]. So that's the problem, too. I don't have anyone to service it. And he's getting too big. It's just too hard for me to do it. As much as I love it, I just need to see. Maybe because that was my second car we had bought and I don't have any. Anyone here I want to go work with. So I just wanted to reach out and see what you guys might have gotcha. Okay. Yeah, for sure. I can definitely help you out with that. And I saw that you were speaking with [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, go ahead and let me transfer. Let me transfer you over to him real quick. Give me just one. Thank you. Yes, ma' am. Of course. Good afternoon, this is [PERSON_NAME] with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How can I help? [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm sorry. We got disconnected. Hi. No worries. I'm so sorry. I think it was on my side. I do apologize. No, no. Do you remember, I don't know, since I said [ORGANIZATION]. Were you working there then? No, ma' am. I don't believe so. Okay. I was just making sure because whoever the gentleman was that sold me, that's what I loved. He was very nice to me. But what do you have to talk to me about? Is there something that we can maybe work something out here or just think about lately? Think about. Yes, absolutely. So you're saying that the car is a little bit too low, so you probably need something a little bit higher. My suggestion would probably be one of our like an X3 that would sit a little bit higher so it's easier to get in and out of. That would be a really good recommendation of mine. I just kind of need to know what is it that you're looking for in your next vehicle. So that way I can start kind of narrowing down some options and send some things your way for you to take a look at. Okay, here's the thing because I have to have another vehicle that has a list for a power wheelchair. So I'm just looking at what a trade in value for the 2. For the 218. Do you have anything on your lot that's not a [ORGANIZATION]? That is luxury somewhat that you would willing to let me. I can't buy it because I've got to have a lift on a van. That's my other thing. I have to pay for another vehicle for him to travel. And that's gotten to be worked. That's. There's no other way around that. So do you have anything that would be of value at that price? That would be somewhat. Or you could start looking for me, it would be of that year for that value. It would be somewhat SUV or Cadillac. Even something that would be nicer for me to just do my runabout. Running as I do without see the van is for it to participate when he goes and he doesn't always go with me. I do a lot of running on my own because we. I've lost my [MARITAL_STATUS] and my other son. So it's just us. So I do all my stuff where I don't take him everywhere because it's expensive. And of course, you know, he's not always wanting just to run in the store and that it's expensive and it's, it's. It's very. Well, it's very expensive with a lift. So this is. I don't have a choice really now. And that's kind of what I'm just seeing if you can start looking to see maybe what we could find for me in that. In that. In that year. Yes, ma' am. Absolutely. So let me do this. I'm going to get a couple. A little bit of information from you. Let me check one thing real fast on my end. Sure. I'm checking something on my end. Want to make sure that we didn't already. And that you bought here from the [LOCATION] store? Yes. Yes. Okay, I've got a good phone number for you. [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER]. Is that correct? Yes. Okay, then I'm here. Of course. Yes. And I love it. But it's Just. I can't afford both. Absolutely. Yes, ma' am. Okay. Make sure. And so what I will do is because I want something, you know, my mother had Cadillacs and Aldeville, and me being a lady, I want something nice. I don't mind suv, but if I'd like to just keep it, something in that, you know, a good car, sporty, like. But I just. There's nothing here I'd even. I wouldn't even go to. And we have it. And before we even had that, before we got the two BMWs, I didn't go over here, so. Absolutely. Okay. So what I've done here is I pinned a little note. Here is the phone number that you're calling me from. Is that a good cell phone? Yes, that's my. That's my main number. Yes, sure, go ahead. I just was saying I'm here. There's no. There's no hurry. Hurry this week, but just. I just will have to have eventually, you know, I need. I need it back. I need. I need something that I could rely on. But it doesn't have to be just this week. But if you can find something that we can both agree on and y' all take it from here, you know, because I can't have. I can't tell. I don't have any way to tell it. Yes, ma' am. Absolutely. So let me get to working on that for you. What I'm going to do is I'm actually going to send you my trade questionnaire. It's just going to have a list of questions on there, such as the VIN of your vehicle, some standard questions about the current condition of the vehicle, and then that way I can have our [OCCUPATION] take a look at it once he's able to kind of give you take a look at it, because obviously we won't be able to give you a true [OCCUPATION] because we won't have seen it in person. What we can do is give you kind of a. I can get kind of an idea about what your vehicle is worth. And then at that point, I can start kind of comparing it to some other vehicles that we currently offer that we have that might fit what you're looking for. Would that be okay? Only thing is, on that I've got, there was the one thing we did, the VIN number and all on it. But there is what there's been. The one time I'm talking about is it the oil has changed. The water was in, but it tried to overheat. And I don't know if I said that it tried to overheat. You know, it was. I called last week to you guys and it tried to overheat. I was just going to let you tow it in and fix it, but that being with the other van and the lift now, I didn't know the lift on this van is going to be so high. I can't really go scale up and let you just fix this because I don't think it's major, but it's overheating somewhat. And I'm afraid if you tow it and you try to look and see what's wrong, I don't know what it is and then I'm not going to be able to ford what it is to fix it because it's just now well past the warranty on it and I have no idea. The water was fine. That's the truth thing. And I just don't know and I don't want to keep it if it's got something a little wrong with it or if it keeps overheating. I'm just being honest and that's kind of where I'm at. I don't know what to put on there when I don't know what if it. It went great into about, I'd say five miles or less. It just started going to a crawl. And I've never had either one do that or this one ever on an oil change. But I just don't. I can't let you just say service tickets. I don't have the money. And what being with this lift, that just a lot of money. So. Yes. Can I just buy out? Right? I mean, what, what's your suggestion? So again, yeah, my suggestion would be. So we'll start there, we'll start with the trade. And just because I can, I have enough information to know. I've already put a few notes here that says the vehicle is having some issues with some overheating. Our only one, only one time. No. And it really didn't overheat that long. I mean it was already. The oil had just been changed. That was just so strange because my brother in law was with me and he said, well, I've never seen anything like that happen because it wasn't, you know, where you could see anything happening to it. So I thought I'm just gonna fix it. But then this lift came about to the price of it and I just thought I'm just gonna have to work with y' all because I can't, I have to have the lift. So that being said, let's Just go from there. And I, I will help someone help me find the VIN number. And I just don't know if I've got. I don't know where it is. And [PERSON_NAME], he's got the information he can send. Send it to me to see what he could be comparable. So if we want to do that, yes, like I said, I'll just send you that trade questionnaire. Like I said, I've put a couple of notes here. If you'll just fill that out for me. And then as soon as you get that over to me, I wait, I can get that over to our [OCCUPATION] and he can start taking a look at what, what our options are. And that way it'll give me a better way to guide you on my best recommendation. Because as of right now, I could tell you I could. There's a thousand different options just because there's so many different variables that I couldn't, I couldn't in good faith tell you what I best believe at this very moment. And so, okay, I got you. Because the way of all, the way, the way they're designed, all the whole body is different. I've had people that have had them that keep wherever. People that told me, oh, I just fix it, or people that just say, I, you know, I didn't. The main thing is the service. But after the list, that's my problem. I could probably be able to fix it, but I will just have to go with that and just, I guess, send it on my phone. Then send me the questionnaire. Okay, let's do that. And if I have a problem trying to find it, because I've had. I couldn't find it last time, but let me just take [DURATION] [DURATION] or so and take it over and then you could just put it in and start from there. Sounds good? Yes. Yes, ma' am. So you'll see it here in your. In your text message here in just a minute. And then if you're having issues trying to find the vin, it's usually right within the door frame. So that's the best place to start to start locating all of that. And then if you have any questions at all, just send me a text. If I do, I'll also have my business card associated with that. If you call, I don't answer. It's just because I'm with a guest at that moment. And it's not that I'm ignoring you, it's just that I give my fullest attention. And so if you'll. Yeah, if you'll. Voicemail I'll just call back as soon as I'm available. Is that okay? That sounds perfect. And I appreciate your time and listening because I do love the car. But we'll work something. I feel like we can. So I'll get my part done as soon as I can. Yes, ma' am. Thank you so much. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. Bye.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I drink your phone call? Which [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Is this one on [LOCATION] or is this in [LOCATION]? This is [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay, I could talk to them too, but can I talk to a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] please? Or a [OCCUPATION] please? Gotcha. Is there a specific pre owned vehicle you're looking at? Purchasing? I'm looking for suv but I don't know what size because you make several different sizes of fuv. I know, I don't want a big one. I'm thinking a [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] one and I'm looking for older model, not a brand new one. Good try. All right, give me just a moment. What was your name, sir? [PERSON_NAME]. Give me just a moment. [PERSON_NAME]. Hey [PERSON_NAME], how are you? This is [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hey, how are you? Good. I'm looking for right now. Right now. Currently own a [ORGANIZATION] Cayenne Turbo [DATE_INTERVAL]. That's amazing. It only has like 85, 9090000 miles on it or whatever. But I'm used to old [NATIONALITY] cars and I also have in my garage the 600 SL. Okay. Have that service and try trade that in. It's [DURATION] years old and I'm looking for a mid size SUV and I don't want anything in the [DATE_INTERVAL] [DURATION] range. I'm looking between [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] if you have anything available. More than likely you might not. Sure. I think I may have a [DATE_INTERVAL] GLE if you're interested in that. And that's a mid size suv. Yeah. So I would say it's comparable to like [ORGANIZATION] X5. So it's not like, it's not like large [LOCATION] size or anything but it's okay. And it's not as small as like an X3 or, or it's only [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's only me and my [MARITAL_STATUS] and I have a wheelchair that has to fit the back so. Or a buy a thing to put it on the back. But anyway I won't buy another [ORGANIZATION]. Just can't, can't do that again. But what are we talking about? How many miles does it have and what kind of price? I'm pulling up right now. So [DATE_INTERVAL] to [DATE_INTERVAL]. All right. So it's actually. No, sorry, I'm going to just correct myself. This is [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] GLE350. It has [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles on it. It's blue. I'm going to go ahead and send you a link so you can view some pictures of it. I'm going to send it to the number you're calling, That'll be fine. All right, I'm gonna do that right now. Well, you can send it to me, but I can't look at it because I'm [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. I'll have my [MARITAL_STATUS] look at it when she comes home. Okay? Okay, no problem. All right, so the, the car is actually here on our lot. So it's, it's like a dark blue. And the interior is beige. It's ginger beige espresso. And the exterior color is called lunar blue metallic. It's an inline six, all wheel drive. It has [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles on it. It seats five people.

It has a DVD player in there and it also has a panoramic roof, a heated steering wheel, a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] surround sound system. So it's, it's which. Which basically to me, that would be great. Yeah. But to my [MARITAL_STATUS], it don't mean nothing. All she does if you're [MARITAL_STATUS] or not, all she does is get in the car, fill the gas 8.8 and go back 1.B and that's it. She don't care. Anything. Excited is there's a red light on the dashboard. I don't know. What do you think you should do about it? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like my [MARITAL_STATUS] too. Yeah. So don't you think you should call them anyway? Now let's get down to nitty gritty. How much? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. You sent me pictures for it. Sure, I'll text it over to you so at least you can see what it looks like and everything. And your [MARITAL_STATUS] can look at it. And if you guys want to, you can swing over here and you know, jump in the car, get a feel for it. Okay. All righty. All righty. And you said it's got [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles on it? [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles? Yes, sir. My dilemma is I don't do the driving right. My port now paid for force is completely paper. That's. That's a nice size suv and everything is good and everything like that. And it's at89,000 miles on it. Can't afford one of those or use one of those. So I just called them. They were calling me $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for [DATE_INTERVAL]. So I'm like, you got. But anyway, my [MARITAL_STATUS] feels that she needs something that she can really depend on. How many, what is the gas mileage on that car? It is 17 on city and 22 on the highway. That's much better than the [ORGANIZATION]. But I'm going from no payments to payments, so we'll be financing. Yeah. But let me. Let me ask you a question. Another question. I have a 1993600 SL, right. A hundred and three thousand miles on it. Barely driven. Just better be. Pancake. Yeah. Would I be able to trade that in for this? Of course. That sounds like a nice car, too. A [DATE_INTERVAL]. That's a great model. Is that the one that [OCCUPATION] [PERSON_NAME] was in? Right. Yep. Yeah. I love that body. So, you know, I love it, too, but I can't drive. You know, my [MARITAL_STATUS] doesn't care what she drives. You know, she's not a car person, but. Right. Fortunately, I can't drive it and it's hard for me to get in and out of it because I'm a big guy. Yeah. All right. So anyway, I'll have her. I'll do this. I'll have her look at the pictures that you sent me. Sure. I'll finish getting my car detailed and everything. Okay. And then I will drive it up for you guys with her. We'll take a look at what you got and see what we could work out. Yeah, we can take it from there. Yeah. No pressure at all. My name is. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. Yes. Send me your information also, you know, if you could do it by text or whatever, that would be good, so I can know who I'm looking for when I come there. Okay. Great. Great chatting with you, [PERSON_NAME]. And when you're coming over with the car, you know, if everything makes sense, I want you to be prepared so we can pull the trigger. If you have the title to your car and the keys, that's all we'll need. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. What [DURATION] were you looking to swing by? Well, it's not going to be for about [DURATION] [DURATION] because like I said, you know, I try to get. Keep my car up to snuff. And I just made the arrangements for. For it to be serviced and have them take a look at it and everything like that. And I heard a little squeaking when my [MARITAL_STATUS] backed out of the driveway, so I think. I don't want them to check the brakes or whatever. No, actually, we wouldn't require any of those things. If you're. If you're actually looking to trade it, don't do anything to the car. Detail it. Don't even detail it. We have. We have. We have a bunch of [OCCUPATION] here. We got a detail standard over here. Don't detail it or anything like that. There's one thing that I need to think as I think I need to do. You could tell me, because if that's the case, I'll have my [MARITAL_STATUS] drive me over there this weekend. Okay. Okay. But the one thing I need to do is my. My sunroof. My sunroof. Because we don't use it all the time and everything because the plastic is, you know, whatever. We. I guess we do it. You can't. We can't do anything but replace the whole roof if the plastic is all messed up. Right? Yeah. I'm not sure. But either way, don't. Don't even fix anything. It's fine. We. We will give you appraisal on the car. I just wouldn't want you to put money into the car, you know, don't do that. Right. Because if. I agree with you there, because if I could work out a deal and you guys could buy the car and. Yeah, we could. Generally, we could. If we could make a deal where I could get a fair offer for the car and I'm not talking to my. Selling me $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm not gonna go for that. I could sell it on my own for more than that. But I'm also not looking for $[MONEY_AMOUNT], you know. Well, no. Yes, I would, because the other [OCCUPATION] that I used to have in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], he said, you kidding? He said your car could go for $[MONEY_AMOUNT] right now. And I'm like, okay, but I'm not looking for that. I'm looking for, you know, your fair or fair price. And if I don't. If you're telling me I don't have to put anything in it, that's even fairer because I. I figured I would have to spend maybe about between [MONEY_AMOUNT] and [MONEY_AMOUNT], you know, for do the breaks. Yeah, you don't. Don't even worry about those things. The convertible is going to cost me $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that's another [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the break at [TIME] and all that. And if I don't have to do that and we could come to a good deal, I could take that money and put it towards the payment of the car. Exactly. And that's what I'm trying to help you accomplish, you know. Okay. And you said it has [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles on it, right? Yes, sir. And what [DURATION] was it? [DATE_INTERVAL]. [DATE_INTERVAL]. [DATE_INTERVAL]. [DATE_INTERVAL], yeah. What kind of warranty would I be able to get on it? So it does not have a warranties. As is, but my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], we have different coverage packages that we can add on to it, and we, you know, we can present those to you, and, you know, you can make this decision as to what. What. What package you'd like to add on. Not a problem. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you back, and we'll make. We'll see you. Thank you. [PERSON_NAME], just look out for my text. I'm going to share that information with you shortly. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you.",success,general_inquiry,GLE 350,medium,True,0d137cd385954a029df50bd32c21b371_transcript.json

"Got cartoon of sales. Yeah, I was hoping to speak to somebody about a. An online listing that I found for a little white Altima sv. I'll be able to assist you with that. I'm trying to pull up the Altima now. Is it the [DATE_INTERVAL] 20? It is a [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] on the odometer? Yes sir. And I've got is the stock number [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]? Yes, that's it. Yes sir, it is showing that it's still available. What questions can I help answer for you? Well, first off man, I apologize I missed your name. My first name is [PERSON_NAME], last name is [PERSON_NAME]. And who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? Hey [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How are you doing today [PERSON_NAME]? And I'm doing great. I appreciate it. I'm just shopping for. I'm actually shopping for a car for my daughter. She's been in the car she learned to drive in for [DURATION] [DURATION] now. We're off to college and time to upgrade her a little bit. The questions that I had come couple questions are just as much as I let a [PERSON_AGE] year old have non negotiables about what she wants. She said that she would really like to have a sunroof. And so every now and then it's been my experience that these [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] listings will be off just a little bit on what the reality of the car is. So I was hoping to confirm that it had a sunroof and then it really had [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay because those were her two biggies after her color choices and whatnot. So I was hoping to confirm that. And then also then I didn't if there was any [ORGANIZATION] information on that listing. I didn't see it. So I was going to ask if there was a, if there was a [ORGANIZATION] report that I could take a look at. Yes sir. Yes sir. I just confirmed the sunroof just by. Because I'm going to send you the link to our dealership website because I think it's a little more user friendly than autotrader because my experience with Autotrader sometimes is it's like everyone else's perception but it's showing a picture that our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] took photos of that it does have a sunroof that is confirmed [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay. I'm still trying to investigate that. But what I will do, I think it was standard, I think it's standard on the sv. But I feel silly if I drove up and when we were through the deal. Yes, Sir. And there's a couple of things that I would do. One part of the process, I always double check the computer. So even when it says something's available, I want to go put my hands on it just to make sure. But I know our website for the dealership does post usually the MSRP and the original window sticker, which I thought maybe I could find that and see if it was listed on the original window sticker from [ORGANIZATION] because that would confirm for us too. But I'm getting close. Here we go. So [PERSON_NAME], I'm about to send you a text message from my work. It's just an opt in message. If you reply yes to that, the next message I will copy and paste the link to the Altima for [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] website. And that way you have access to the [ORGANIZATION] a lot easier and some of those other things that you're looking for. But here, I'mma check and see. Let's see. What I could do is I can send you a link. All right, all right, all right. Yeah, it'll let me, it'll let me do it here in a second. I'm. I'm over here trying to read about the [ORGANIZATION]. Alright, so it shows, so it shows [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay as. Yeah, it shows [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay as standard [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay compatibility smartphone connectivity. But what I honestly, what I'll do when we hop off, I'm gonna go sit in the car with a cord and just make that do the old fashioned way. There we go. Feel like some pilgrims did. Yeah. Oh man. As much as I love computers, some stuff I'd rather just get up and go do and just make sure that way I feel confident about it too. Here, let me get back over here. It still hasn't, I don't know why it still hasn't let me. It still hasn't let me in yet. See what's going on. So where are you guys driving from? Because I heard you say you'd be driving in to take a look at it. Yeah, I'm actually down in. I'm down in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] outside of [LOCATION]. Okay. In fact, I don't even know, to be candid with you, I don't even know where [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [ORGANIZATION] is. I just know it's within 500 miles of me because that's what I [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] to give me. We are. Our biggest city, which is about [DURATION] [DURATION] away is [LOCATION]. So we're just, we're just outside of [LOCATION]. Okay. Yeah, well that's, that's bearable. I've driven up. I've done this deal. I've flown to [LOCATION] and driven. The truck came from [LOCATION]. I trade. Drove my Jeep up there and traded in for a truck up in [LOCATION]. So. So I. I'm. I'm pretty easy to get along with on where a car is. And something to note with our dealership. It's awesome that we don't require you to come to the store to do maintenance, but this car will come with a lifetime powertrain warranty. And the company that we use is called [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. We selected nationwide coverage. It doesn't matter where you are. The only thing that she has to do is take it to a [OCCUPATION]. So say next to her college is a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] where they're ASE certified to work there. So all of her maintenance records will be on [ORGANIZATION] if anything happens. It's a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deductible to replace an engine, a transmission, this car's front wheel drive to the front drive axle. But it also covers things like the fuel pump, the water pump, the oil pump, the seals, gaskets, bearings. That'll be covered on this car for however long she owns it. And you said that with any ASE certified place. Any ASE certified [OCCUPATION] can work on that car and it stay within the qualifications for that lifetime powertrain warranty. And I just sent you a picture of my business card because I don't know what's going on with this computer. I sent you a picture of my business card. If you got a message from an [PHONE_NUMBER] number, that's me. I'm going to go ahead and try to copy and paste this link off my phone and send it to you. That way you'll have everything on your. Yeah, because I don't know what's going on with the work computer. Let me put. There we go. Got it. Boom. There we go. And [PERSON_NAME], there you go. That's the [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] link for the Altima. Let me check the card factor. So it does show that it was in an accident. Let's see. Oh, was it? Yeah, it said 323 of [DATE_INTERVAL]. It was reported in an accident. So that's going to be on there as well. Okay. And said it was in a. Involved in a sideswipe collision. And you're seeing that on the [ORGANIZATION]. Yes, sir. And once that link pops up for you, everything's. I guess I'm used to it too. So I don't want to say it's easy to use, but it's sort of easy identifiable. Underneath the pictures will have the VIN number, the stock number. So you can just confirm that I sent you the right one, the mileage, and then the year, make, model of the car. And as you continue to scroll down, you'll see vehicle records. You click there, it'll take you to everything that we know about the car, all the service records that we have for the carfax, even the original brochure for the vehicle, because that's where I was going through to read about the [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay, just to make sure that it was available in that model. Okay. And so the. The carfax information is wired into this link that you sent in. Is that correct? Yes, sir. Okay. Yes, sir. All right, cool. And then. And then once. Once motions. I don't ask the guy to do it right away because I don't want to. I don't want to hassle and take up somebody's time over. Over something prematurely. But once, Once we. Once. Once this card made it into kind of the, you know, round two or the. Or the, you know, the final four or whatever the case may be. I would usually ask if the. If the guy or lady wouldn't mind just walking around the car and taking any pictures of any little blemishes on the. On the exterior stains or wear on the upholstery or just so I don't get surprised, you know, when I get there. And then. Yeah, absolutely. And then same kind of question on the, you know, just the tread on the tires and so forth like that. Yeah, I have no problem doing any of that. And I noticed that you were an iPhone, so I know the pictures and videos, they'll come through as quality. I know anytime I send to Android phones, it's a little tough because the distortion. Yeah. But yeah, I don't have a problem doing any of that. Not at all. Okay. I appreciate it. Well, I'll watch for that and then take a look at the. At the link that you sent me to the. To the car on [ORGANIZATION] website. And then. And then we can just to be transparent about it, I'm. I'm going to cover the first $[MONEY_AMOUNT] of this purchase, and then my daughter has a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] to put with it to finish it out. I'm just. What to do is she gave me, you know, she gave me the Sunroof and [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay criteria and then some colors that she liked, and I'm just going to hand her three or four cars, you know, with the best prices and with the. That match up her, you know, her color choices best and so forth and just let her pick from amongst them. So she will, we will do [LOCATION] tax when we get back here. I guess that's how it's typically gone where we, we pay, pay our taxes here when we get the tag and so on. So closer you get me out the door to, you know, maybe 20,500 or something before, before the tax, before the tax conversation would, would just put you in better standing for, for getting past her, you know, her, her whatever her, you know, flexibility is going to be with, with the rest of the price. Yes sir. Yes sir, I completely understand. And I know the way our dealership rolls. We title everything in house. The only state that we can't do your sales tax, [ORGANIZATION] and license plate for is [LOCATION] because they're apparently on another planet. So leaving out of here, we would finalize everything. So the car, the warranty, everything that comes with the vehicle as projected. You would have your sales tax calculated into it. We would calculate your [ORGANIZATION] and all that stuff would be paid up front. The only thing that you would be responsible for is your property tax. For some reason a car business in the [LOCATION], I know in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] a little different. They handle everything in the [LOCATION]. We can't collect your property tax, that's with your municipality. So you would have to just wait until you got your license plate from your [ORGANIZATION], which should all be filed for through us. And, and however they attach your property tax, that would come to you. So I'm [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Like I said originally, whenever I buy a new car, new plates, I have to contact the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], notify them that I purchased a car. Then they do a tax based deduction on what the vehicle's value is and then they send me the property tax. That's the only thing we don't handle but sales tax, registration, [ORGANIZATION] title, we do all that. So you leave out of here with a temp tag and a smile. Yeah, okay, well that, that, that's perfectly fine too, you know, if it saves me another stop, I'm certainly happy for that. Yes, sir. So, yeah, okay, well then I'll take a look at that stuff and then if you don't, and if you don't mind on those folks on those just blemish top photos and tired and tire tread type stuff, I'll, I'll watch for that. Check out the [ORGANIZATION] thing. And then, and then, and then we can, you know, we kind of see where we stand because I've worked on this for a couple of days and had gotten it down to three or four cars. And I thought, just on a whim this morning, I thought, well, let me look one more. Some other cars. Some. You know, some other cars popped up that weren't in that first search that I did, so. Yes, sir. Yes, Sir. Well, we [MONEY_AMOUNT] appreciate you reaching out to us. I'm gonna go make those videos and pictures for you here shortly and get those over to you. And. And if you have any questions in the meantime, number the one I sent. That's the best way to get me text call. Any questions you have, I'm happy to answer. Okay, you know what? Just to just so that I don't forget it, what is that number? And I'll put it on my file that I'm where I'm typing. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay, cool. Yes, sir. All right, man. Listen, [PERSON_NAME], I appreciate your help. And I'll watch for the videos and take a look at the file you sent. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I appreciate you appreciate it, brother. All right. Bye.

So I was just kind of seeing if there was another option if I could bring it in today. Yeah, the bet. Because, like, let's say if you want to trade in, I can pay you a lot of money, but if you just want to sell it to us, we have to have your car in here. The third option would be what you can do.

I want to, I want to double check and see what, how much warranty has left. Give me a second here. Okay. Okay, so this one is going to be a [ORGANIZATION] certified vehicle. Right. So it's so you can get into a program that we offer because the warranty is going to come with. Let me start there. It's going to have. For the drivetrain, it came with the [DURATION] [DURATION] 50,000 mile warranty. So it's going to have [DURATION] [DURATION] or 34,000 miles left. And then the basic, the bumper to bumper is 40,000 miles. So it's going to have [DURATION] [DURATION] again, same 34,000 miles. But so for that let's go back to that drivetrain and powertrain warranty. Right. Instead of 34,000 miles, we actually have a program which is called [ORGANIZATION] Promise. And it's a one time fee of $[MONEY_AMOUNT] one time. But what it's going to do Is it's going to take that 34,000 and it's going to give you [DURATION] [DURATION]. 100,000. So you're going to get a much bigger warranty for a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. So $[MONEY_AMOUNT] one time for 800 miles. Okay. So 100k, 100k miles, [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yep. So keep that in mind. And. Yeah, and you said [MONEY_AMOUNT] day, right? Yeah. So is that only at your dealership or. Because I'm. No, no. Yeah. No, you'd be anywhere that is certified that that would suffice. Okay. Now kind of looking at payments and everything. Now the rates on here are going to be just the average market rates. Right. So we wouldn't know yours until we ran credit and everything. But [DURATION] [DURATION], [MONEY_AMOUNT] down, you're going to be around $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [DURATION] [DURATION] would bring you down to around [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. Now would you be, you know, if you were interested in this one and if you wanted to go with it, would you be driving up to get it or how would you work that out? I probably gotta get it because it's just like a [DURATION] [DURATION] drive. Yeah, it's not a bad drive at all. I've done. I've done the drive many times. It's not bad at all. Yeah. Or what you do, jump on a quick little. Quick little spirit flight for [TIME]. Right, right, exactly. Do that. We'll pick you up in the airport and you'll be on your way. I am not. I am not against that at all either, so. But yeah, it's a beautiful vehicle. Okay. Okay. Yeah. If you give me over the videos and just break down everything that we talked about. Perfect. What I'll do then I'll send you a video and then I'll send you an email breaking down the numbers. Did you want. Are you kind of thinking [DURATION] [DURATION]? Yeah, [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, perfect. I'll give you some documentation on that and then once you receive that, look everything over and give me a buzz back and let me know what you think. And if you want to move forward, I'll get you in our system so we can text back and forth too, but yeah, man, we'd love to earn your business. Okay, awesome. And yeah, if we could get like a breakdown of the warranty because. Possible you guys have that or. Yeah, yeah, I'll get you that right away. Okay, cool. All right, but I'm sorry, and what's your name? Your name? My name? Yeah, my name again was [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. We'll talk soon. Thank you.

"Thank you for calling the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. For new vehicle [ORGANIZATION], press [PHONE_NUMBER]. For pre owned vehicle sale. Wait while I transfer your call. Good morning, this is [PERSON_NAME] in [ORGANIZATION]. May I ask who I'm speaking with? [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Yes, can I speak to [PERSON_NAME], please? Yeah, of course. One moment. Thank you. Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, [PERSON_NAME], how you doing? I'm okay. My son said we can use his rebate on the. Oh, great. Yeah, he sweet after getting information from you, that was helpful. Okay, good. He said he wants to purchase his car, so thank you for printing that off. That helped us. Heck yeah, it did. $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. That's wonderful. Okay, so I don't know what we need. I don't know what we need to do. To do? Does. Do you just apply to our thing? Does he have to sign something or are we good? No, it's transferable between households. So as long as. Yeah, as long as he's good with you using it, it actually doesn't even matter. You're the boss. But yeah, I wouldn't steal it. No. Right. But no, you don't have to sign anything special. I'll just add that rebate to the deal. Do you still want to put the [MONEY_AMOUNT] down or do you want me to, like, rework that? Rework the number for you? No, I'm still gonna put [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Plus the rebate. Yes. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I was even thinking of doing more, but my [MARITAL_STATUS] like, leaving [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I already told her [MONEY_AMOUNT]. We're leaving it at that. Okay. And when you're here, of course, if you want to make a change, you always can. I mean, it's. I'm sitting here factoring in, like, the term of the loan and stuff, and I'm the one that pays the bills. He doesn't. I'm sick of looking at the money amount. I'm sure you figured that out yesterday, didn't ya? Yes. I love it. I love it. It's very helpful when someone is. Someone is really involved, you know, like the one person that knows what's going on, that's the one who figures it out. Tired of him, like, going in there and just like, running the cars down. And then one time we just argued and he got mad and we walked away. I'm like, I'm just tired of it. I'm like, oh, God, he doesn't drive the car. He don't care. Don't even test drive him. He just walks off with them. And I'm like, seriously, for him, like just good transportation and for you, it's, you know, you do the planning and make sure all the money works. That's perfect. I do. [PERSON_NAME], our. He was thinking the retail value of the other one might be a little better. I started rethinking it a little bit after, you know, we were talking about it, but it was the amount. I'm like, is it really much of a difference with the charger and this thing? I don't know. Part of my brain thought about it after we told you that and like, which one is really better? Like, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] though. I don't think you'll. Yeah, I don't think you'd lose either way. I mean, I think you're. You're further ahead on that demo just because of the savings. You know, it's the same model year. It's not like they changed design or anything. So. Yeah, I don't. I think you did good by going that route. It's not much they're giving you. I mean, really, except for the. Well, yeah, I mean, a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] and it only has 794 miles. So it used to be demos that gave you a thousand, but you would take something that had like three or four thousand miles. So that's why I feel. I felt like, oh, no, our truck had 5,000 miles on it with a demo when we got it. Yeah, yeah. And then it's something to like compare, you know. Well, what should I do? Should I go, you know, our truck load, it was loaded. It's [LOCATION]. It was really loaded with what we got. It was a huge thing from [ORGANIZATION]. It was a big discount. So, I mean, what we got was like, we couldn't pass it up. I'm like, seriously, what a big discount. We would have never bought that normally. That was like why we did it. I'm like, oh, I see why I wanted it. Like, I never. I don't know how [ORGANIZATION] does it because we're just like, oh. I kept saying, no way. And I'm like, oh, I get why you wanted it. But he's got an old truck now. It's [DATE_INTERVAL]. It's a bit different. I'm like, nowadays, I'm like, yep, never looking at one of those again. I can't afford that. Oh, for real now. It's probably a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] truck, right? It is. He already told me [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yep. Oh, my goodness. Isn't that terrible? Yeah. No, we'll pull. Do you want to. Do you want me to call your insurance company and tell them what we're doing? You can. I didn't know if I should do it or. Yeah, I didn't know. Okay. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME] found it. So as long as they'll talk to us, we'll give them a call and tell them the vin. And then if they need more information from you, we'll just tell them to reach out to you. Yeah, sometimes that one lady's kind of snarky, so maybe she'll like you guys better. Maybe we'll get a nice one. You never know who you're gonna get, right? The ones. All right. The other one is a little weird, but I've been with them for a long time, so. Yeah, maybe you can do it. Have fun. Cool. Yeah, I'll let you know if I have any trouble. Yeah, so, yeah, I was going to ask you that because I think I got the right vin. I was like, we should probably get that taken care of right away, because I don't want to have a problem with that. Yeah, yeah, I'll call. We'll give them a call right now, and we'll let you know if there's any issue. But then all we need to do is bring the title and my extra key with me. Right? That's perfect. That is it. That [MONEY_AMOUNT] you can do, like, on your debit card or on a credit card, whatever you want to use. Oh, oh, we can do credit card. I don't want to do that, so. Oh, can we bring cash? So we were just gonna go to the bank and get cash. Do you not want cash or cash? Yeah, whatever you like better. I mean, it doesn't matter to us. We just don't. They don't like a personal check, but debit card, credit card, or cash, all those work. Whatever is for you. Yeah, because the bank said I was gonna get it out. We actually don't have. I only have an atm. I don't actually have a debit car. That particular bank. I guess I could dump the money into my other account and do the debit. I just don't let him use the debit card there. Don't even tell him I told you that. No, definitely not. Yeah, whatever you want to bring. I grab cash out of that account, and I never. And we don't have a. The debit card hasn't come yet. We're waiting for it to come, and so we just did it so he could have access. And I'm like, oh, it didn't. I didn't come yet. Like, I always just do it myself. No worries. I just go in there and get the money so that there's never ever. It makes it so that you don't, you know. I keep track of it that way better. No, really, it's like, whatever works, you know, as long as you got a system, stick to it. I had just recently got a debit card. I was still old school, but they closed all the banks, so I had to get a debit card. Yeah, I know they're trying. I mean, they're just doing such weird things. They don't even want us to carry cash anymore. I mean, it's just so many strange, strange things. Yeah, that's why we just ordered that one, because there's no open bank. So I'm like, well, you have to have one, so. Yeah, I'm really old school. I'm sorry. I, like, walk in and get it. I'm like, it's too much of a pain now. So I'm like, okay, whatever. No, whatever works. All right, I'll get a hold of them now in case we have any issues. I will let you know and I'll see you around [TIME]. Okay, got you. Thank you. Appreciate your awesome.

"Bet. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. My name is [PERSON_NAME], how can I help? I bet you're about ready to take off for the big weekends. Yeah, yeah, we got a big weekend ahead of us, huge sales going on. Yeah, I'm just sneaking in here to ask a question of you. That's fine. Fire away. I'm looking for a particular year end model of the [ORGANIZATION] Ridgeline. And I wonder, do dealerships ever like get them from somewhere else and bring them in for somebody who wants them and doesn't want to drive 500 miles to the other dealership? Yeah, I mean there's been instances where we do things like that for people before. I don't know if you know this but we're part of [ORGANIZATION] so we're the largest auto group in the nation. So we have a huge pool of cars. If there's a specific car you're looking for, we have no problem going to get it. It usually comes with a fee of us going to get it and then also sometimes with that, if it's outside of our local area, we have to kind of have you sign up and buy the car before it's even here. Without seeing it and driving it doesn't sound good. Yeah. And the reason of it is we don't want to buy that. We have to buy it from one of our partners. And for us to buy it, it's better for us to buy it if we know we have somebody who's going to buy it from us. Does that make sense as a business model? What kind of Ridgeline are you looking for? Well, it's not going to work because I just, I am probably incapable of buying something I've not seen and driven and all that stuff. We see a lot of rotating inventory. So if you let me know what you want, I can keep my eyes peeled and keep a lookout for you. I would do that. I forget which model I settled on though. Anyway, it was a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Let me see if I wrote them what model. They're just, they're hard to find and you know, especially with not a billion miles on it. Let me see if I wrote it down. I think I did. But where is the big question. I drive a Ridgeline myself. Yeah, they're getting much more popular and people have figured it out. Yeah, we're having some of our, our best deals on, on new cars on our Ridgelines right now. Yeah, I won't buy new. So [DATE_INTERVAL]. Well, that's not it right now. Okay. Okay. There's I think the [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, I think it's the [ORGANIZATION]. Because the P. [ORGANIZATION] T has all this tech that I just plain don't want. I'm an old star. I just don't want to deal with it. But. So [ORGANIZATION] would be my number one choice. Sure. And that's the. Looks like I potentially have a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION]. Oh, it's with the T. That one. But you don't have to use all the tack it can be on there. And you don't have to use it, you know. Right. It's sitting there nagging me, though. No, I wonder what it would do because I read this thing about lane change. Well, I live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], and there's no place to change lanes anyway. Are you in [LOCATION] on. On the [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? Yeah. You're up in [LOCATION]. I'm in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. I thought you said [LOCATION]. Yeah. Okay, so the [DATE_INTERVAL] Ridgeline [ORGANIZATION] with low miles. And if we did happen to get one here on the lot, would you make the drive at least to [LOCATION] to get. Definitely would. If they come and look at it anyway? You bet I would. Absolutely, yes. Okay. That's why I'm calling. Yeah. There you go. Here's an idea. I have a certain pool of inventory that I can sell from here in [LOCATION]. I can take down a number for you and essentially get with you if I see anything at any of our four [OCCUPATION] in town. Okay. Okay. What's your first name? [PERSON_NAME]. Like the bird [PERSON_NAME]. And last name? [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And then what's a good callback number for you? [PERSON_NAME] [PHONE_NUMBER]. All right. Once again, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm here at the [ORGANIZATION] dealership in [LOCATION]. I'll do some research on the [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] bridge line and see if we have anything in our remote vicinity. If I do, I'll let you know. Would you prefer call or text message? Text me first because I won't pick up if I don't know the phone number. Okay. You can always leave a mess there or you just leave a voice message. Did you say you have an rtlt? Yeah, it seems like within our inventory. I have an [ORGANIZATION]. What year? [DATE_INTERVAL] with 29,000 miles on it. Oh, shoot. Okay. And then I have. It's priced at about just under [MONEY_AMOUNT] silver. It looks like it has a roof rack and a trailer hitch. And she looks pretty ready to go. Okay, I'll have to see. Look up my objections to the rtlp. Yeah. See if it's worth it for you. Yeah. Because my understanding is that. So I need the Capacity to tow. And my understanding is that the Sport doesn't have the all wheel drive that you need for towing and the RT does not have the all wheel drive that you need for towing. Is that correct? [ORGANIZATION] should have the same all wheel drive as an [ORGANIZATION], right? Yeah. It should have the same towing capacity as well. Right. I wasn't selling them in [DATE_INTERVAL], but I've been selling since [DATE_INTERVAL], so. But apparently the RT and the Sport do not have that package. I could see that. I could see that. The [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] should have it. Yeah. Let me check it. And [ORGANIZATION]. And [ORGANIZATION], right? They do. They do. I've done my research. You don't have to do it. And then the [ORGANIZATION] need it. It's more expensive. Okay. Well, you know, I'm happy to check in with our other store here and see if it's something that we can sell. If not, I'll just refer you to them or I'll send you a link on that. And then I'll check my other stores too and do a little bit of research for you, [PERSON_NAME]. Great. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. And have a wonderful long weekend. I hope you get one. You too. No, we're here at sales. What do you mean? How'd you get it? You do. And I'm [OCCUPATION], so of course I get it off. There you go. That's a good way to be. Okay. What do you drive now, [PERSON_NAME]? I got a Tacoma. [DATE_INTERVAL] Tacoma. Can't tow anything. It's a four cylinder. Yeah. Okay. So just looking for a comfy replacement. It sounds good. We'll try and get you the car of your dreams. Well, that would be lovely. That would be lovely. That's our goal.

Oh, the one that has like a lighter color. Yeah, it looks like I do have. I just need to verify. Let me know if you have any question or when is the best time you can come in so I can make sure the car is still here. The XT6 you have, what [DURATION] is that? The XT6 is a sports version, [DATE_INTERVAL]. And I think the one you're looking at is a premium version. Yes. Yeah, so the one is a [DATE_INTERVAL], let's say. I'm going to compare a little bit over here. The one you're looking at XT5 Premium with the 50,000 miles. The price is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And this [DATE_INTERVAL] XT6 is a 42,000. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's a huge price difference. But I mean, the miles are double. Even. Even you could even finish speaking. You were like, oh, yeah, I know, man. You have a look at that. Because the 40 to 400. But you know, miles is definitely low, man. It' like a new man. You know, I test those for one of the customer. There's a 30,000 miles. It's a nice clean car. By the way. I want to let you know that it's a very nice clean car. Yes, but no, I mean the one you're looking at is not a bad car. I mean, it's truly. It's all a Cadillac and for the price.

That's not a problem. Did the text works fine. I mean, you know, so all you have to do when you get my text is opt in? Yes. And what's the first name? Did you say [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, got it. [PERSON_NAME] again, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. When you get my text, just opt in. Yes. And I'll put this total number for you and see what do you think of it and do you have anything to portray it or. No, I have a car. I do. Okay. I'll tell you right now. The years [DATE_INTERVAL]. It's a [ORGANIZATION] Escape for escape. Okay. Se. It has 142000 miles on it. Yeah, well that's a big upgrade. You're getting it from the Escape to Cadillac. Oh, I always try to do something better than that. It's just. Yeah, no, no, I got you. No, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no. It's nothing wrong with man. You know, hey, sometime, you know, it make you happy and nothing with that. What does your dealership specialize in, if you don't mind me asking? No, I mean we are a [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] so you know, we are, yeah, we are [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] and basically rather, you know, all of our used car goes through the process of you know, reconditioning basically that, you know, get to the shop, get a detail, get checked out, everything make sure it's ready for the next owner. So I don't know if you have a chance to look at the carfax on this car. I've just clicked on it the one owner car and look like it's a clean car. Very nice car on it. Let's see that is. Did you had a chance to look at the carfax? Yes. The rental fit? Yeah, I see that it's got minor damage. Look like somebody danked in or something. And it can be. It's not all damage is caused by accident. Get the independent. So it looked like sometime you know when they bump into person and you call the [OCCUPATION]. But other than that it looks like a pretty good car. But again, you know, you have to look at in person, you know and see how you like it. I mean that's the best way to come and take a look at. Are you local here? So the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah. Where are you located? We are on [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. Right where the [LOCATION] and the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] which is close to [LOCATION]. Between [LOCATION] and [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'm looking at the address right now. That's off the [LOCATION] [LOCATION], right? Yeah, it's address is. Let's see. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Like you know, if you're Coming from [LOCATION], if you're familiar from [LOCATION], then going toward [LOCATION]. So right before the [LOCATION] [LOCATION], that's where we are on the left side. So I'm not sure which part of the county coming from or I'm coming from [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]. Okay, so you're coming from [LOCATION]. So basically you can take 45 and then probably let's say 45, 45. And I take a 6 10, 6 10, go to the [LOCATION] area and then going toward [LOCATION], just go straight and you know you're going to pass the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION], then the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. And right off the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] are on a [LOCATION] [LOCATION] exit. And when you exit at the light, you take a left cross a rail track. Matter of fact, you can see us from the freeway from [LOCATION], so you can't miss it. Okay, so if you can do me, if you can write that up for me, send that to me before. Yeah, I'll. I'll send you. And this the force gift that you have, is it paid off? No, no, I owe [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it. Okay. Okay, not a problem.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. One moment. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How may I help you? Oh yeah, I was interested to see if anybody claims the vehicle coming into your lot. Which vehicle is it? So yeah, the vents are limited. Let me double check it is available. Are you able to stop in? I will be driving through that area tomorrow. What time are you guys open till we are here tomorrow? Our last appointment? [TIME]. Okay, and then if someone decides to purchase the vehicle, is there like a hold on it at all or. Yes. Yep. It's a deposit used towards the purchase of the vehicle. Okay. And then if someone say [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] comes in there, once the buys it, they get first crack. How soon can they. Oh no, I'm just saying like how soon can they drive off the lot with it? Let me check. All right. Is this the best number to reach you in case we get disconnected? Yeah, and I'll put the test that one that would be here, let's see. Hopefully within the next week. But there have been delays. But so far it doesn't seem like there's any delays [TIME] [TIME] process but doesn't mean that can't change. So if there's no delays, [DURATION] [DURATION] within [DURATION] [DURATION] could be here by the end of the month. Seems realistic. But if there's a delay, obviously I can't help them. We're not gonna make any promises that we can't, we can't keep. Okay, understood. And then does that vehicle come with navigation at all or not? [ORGANIZATION] Auto, [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay? Yes. Okay, close my other question on that. And then if someone wanted to put a deposit onto that, how much would that be? [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the choose source of purchase. Okay. And then if they. Let's see. Other questions I had. Does it matter if they're from out of state? Nope. Or does it have to be a [LOCATION] owner? We would prefer them to be in [LOCATION]. It's definitely a better situation for us. Even if we don't make as much selling to someone locally, the chances of them buying again if they're in our area is much higher than someone who is out of state. In addition, if they bring in for service, there's a higher chance that someone's going to bring in for service versus again out of state. But let me check. I know for people out of market, the is if they're not. If someone is not in our market, which there's what, 10 counties I believe on this particular one. I'm in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. [LOCATION], yeah. There would be a market adjustment of $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Unless you're trading something in that we can then turn around and sell. There would be a [MONEY_AMOUNT] market adjustment. Yeah. I just got my car appraised at another [ORGANIZATION] down here, but the car sold before I can put a down deposit. They put a value between [MONEY_AMOUNT] and 21 of my [DATE_INTERVAL] countrymen. Okay. So I'm figuring probably in that same ballpark, the. My issue is I'm actually driving from the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] up to. Back to [LOCATION]. And then I was going to drive back from [LOCATION] down this way for a trip. I just wasn't sure when it might come in. When will you get a solid answer on the exact arrival date and from the arrival date? Yeah, the day it gets here. Generally I might get like a [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] notice, but it's kind of out of our control. It's the same with every dealership. Whenever it gets here, it gets here. The only thing I can tell you is that it has a processing date from the port for the [DATE]. So. And then if it was something that got here. Yes. Okay. Because I'm driving back on Tuesday. That would be perfect if it arrived over the weekend and kind of go from there. Now the [DATE] is what, Sunday? Yeah. No, no, [DATE] is [DATE]. So if it doesn't arrive by Thursday or Friday, then it probably won't arrive until Tuesday or Wednesday. Usually the holidays back everything up. And we would expect any customer who puts a deposit to pick the vehicle up within [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Especially considering it's the end of the month. We would want to have it picked up before the end of the month or within [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] just because we're not [TIME] [TIME] business, the whole vehicles. Oh, yeah, I understand. What is your name, by the way? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. And your last name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. And is there a good email I can email over all the specs to you of this particular? [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS]? Yep. [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. And then comes. All right, I'll send you an email if you have any questions. My cell phone will be [TIME] [TIME] email. All the specs will be in there. And then what time are you thinking about stopping out tomorrow? Well, if the vehicle's not there, I'm not gonna. I can just keep driving. That's the. I was going to do a different route back home. Basically the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] through [LOCATION] area. But if it's available, if it comes in before that, obviously I would redirect to [LOCATION] area. Okay, so you just want to wait until it gets here, not put a deposit on it. I'm only going to be available on Tuesday to drive back from [LOCATION] down to the [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. So it's going to be like a flip of the coin. I hate to put $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down, you know, just because the timing is not going to be there. I can put a deposit. I don't want to put such a high one just because the chances of it coming in over the weekend and like, I'll be on the road by from [LOCATION] usually around [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. So I'll probably be there right when you guys open. Is it [TIME] or [TIME]? You guys open? We open at [TIME]. Okay. Yeah. So if I leave at that time, that'll be a perfect time to. Right. When you open it, take care of everything and do almost like a swap my vehicle for that vehicle and continue on. That's. That's my goal. Yes, sir. Yeah, I just hate to have something. I'll call you if it arrives here and we'll go from there, you know. Is there any way that they can do like a smaller temporary deposit and based on the time it comes in? Because it's only that little window I have because I got to report on base on Wednesday. Okay. What. What branch? You said base. I work for the [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. At [LOCATION] [LOCATION] in [LOCATION]? Yes, sir. Are you being stationed there? Is that the reason? Yeah, but I still own property in [LOCATION], so I'd like to have everything just [TIME] [TIME] [LOCATION] one. Okay. Understand. All right, let me see what I can do. I'm prior service myself, so I thank you for your service. Let me see what I can do. But at the end of the day, if we take a deposit, we are going to expect you to pick up the vehicle. If you can't get out here for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] because you have a military obligation. Yeah. Oh, no, I'm. I got it. I'm. I mean, if it comes on Friday itself, I'm. I won't be able to get there till Tuesday. Okay. That's the only. Because I'm up uptown in. If it's the follow, like ask. If it comes in after Tuesday, just refund the deposit. Okay. Yeah, we will. We won't take a deposit then. Yeah, let me. We'll just play it by ear. If it arrives here, I'll give you a call. In the meantime, if you can fill out an online trade appraisal. Just. So if we do decide, hey, the vehicle gets here, at least you know what we're going to give you for your trade if you have anything in writing for many [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] that would help me do if. Or just keep that in mind so I can send an online trade appraisal if you want to fill that out. So if the vehicle does get here, we. That's just one of my things we gotta worry about. It takes [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah, I can double pictures. Yeah, I can send you the recent ones from the two [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] down here. Okay. And then also do that. I won't be able to do it until probably like, you know, maybe like the next [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, sounds good. I just sent you that trade appraisal. If you have any questions, give me a call. I'm here to help you. Okay, awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you. You take care. All right, thanks.",failure,inventory_check,unknown,medium,True,0d38faad418e4c68be6fc448b0776bbd_transcript.json

Well, I'm looking to sell it because one I'm trying to find a Mini Cooper to actually buy. Huh. And most car lots the vehicle has been setting for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Would it crank and get get here. Do you know where we are on [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? I would have to tow it there because the tires it'll crank up. I I had the actual timing redone on it it'll crank up. I've not drove it in a while. I've been in bankruptcy. So it's been setting and actually sitting in a carport for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] now. All right, so you're just looking to sell. Do you any idea what you're looking to get for it? Well, [MONEY_AMOUNT] $[MONEY_AMOUNT] because I mean I, I know the, the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] value on it even for it just being in like bottom line condition is still close to [MONEY_AMOUNT].

Let me, let me run this by my, my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and because I don't want you towing it here if there's no no, I understand what you want for so I just want to we go ahead and do that so I make sure that if the truck's in good enough shape that we'd be able to offer you that and I wouldn't want you to, you know, spend money. You're good brother. I understand what you're doing and I appreciate you explaining it to me. I mean but I got what you. It's got to be worth your time.

Anything else that we should know about any check engine, lights or anything like that that are on the truck they remember I'm not, I've not drove it in a while. The only thing I replaced the fuel module on it. I replaced the fuel injectors on it. I replaced the fuel pump on it before it set, just because I was actually just tracing a problem. And come to find out, it was the timing that jumped. I paid $[MONEY_AMOUNT] to have the timing redone on it. So it cranks up, it runs. I put a new battery on it, but that was [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, so that's probably no good anymore. It don't really have too many blemishes on the outside of it, and the interiors, pretty much immaculate. All right, Very good. Yeah. Let me. Let me just do some work on this for you.

"I can help you. Hey, I got a quick question. So yesterday I was in there with my girlfriend. We got a car, and then it didn't pass service. And she's looking for car. And I was curious if y' all could are able to bring cars from other red [ORGANIZATION] sealers or no. Yes, sir. Okay. I saw that E12, like, Highland in at which one? Red [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. Yes, sir. It's a Highlander. Yeah, I was just gonna see if my girlfriend liked that car or not. Did you. Did you have a stock number? Yeah, actually. Where did I go? The stock number is [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] or. No, it's [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Thank you. And it's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Highlander. Yeah, I was just gonna see if y' all can move it before I call my girlfriend and ask her, because I didn't want to. I could definitely do that for you. Who does the pleasure speaking with? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, nice speaking with you, [PERSON_NAME]. Like I said, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. If you don't mind, I'm just gonna inquire on the availability of this vehicle, because I see it is just a fresh stock that they just took in on trade, and just make sure that's available, and if so, I'll see if I can get it transported over here. But if not, I mean, was your. You know, just in case it. The vehicle sold or didn't pass inspection? Were y' all only looking for a Highlander, or were we on the market for. No, no. She was looking at a [ORGANIZATION] Escape. But it didn't pass the service. Absolutely. I could tell you. I mean, we just took in a whole heap of SUVs over the [EVENT] [EVENT] weekend. I don't know. You said y' all were there yesterday. Yeah. Who are you working. Who are you working with? I don't know his name. He's probably, like, pretty high [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], young kid. Okay. Yeah. If you don't mind, I'm gonna inquire on. On the availability of this vehicle for you, [PERSON_NAME]. This is a good number to reach back to you. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Awesome. Okay. And if you don't mind, I'm also. I'm going to walk my trade line and just see if I have taken in anything that maybe y' all didn't get the chance to look at before y' all left. At the end of the day, what were you looking for, if you don't mind me asking? Like, was there any certain specifications that you know that your. Your girlfriend was from? Mid size SUV from 17 or from 15 to like 20,000. Okay. Yes, sir. And then I said, you're looking at escape. I know for sure we have other inventory that's, you know, in that comparable price range. I'm gonna go ahead, if you don't mind. While I'm waiting on the availability confirmation on this vehicle, I'm gonna get a little good list compiled up and I'll send you over some pictures. But we would love to have see if we can get you a deal going for you today, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, just shoot me a text message and you can send them that way. Or I can send you my email after you text me. That sounds good. Okay, [PERSON_NAME]. All right. If the, if the vehicle was available though and I could get it brought over here, what was your availability looking like for today? Wouldn't you be able to make it? Probably be like [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] around there. I don't know what time you'll close today. Okay. Yes, sir. Now we don't close till [TIME] Okay, I was thinking that. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna give my girlfriend a call and let her know about that highlander and see what she thinks. Sounds good, [PERSON_NAME]. And you'll be hearing from me momentarily. Sounds great.

"It. Good morning. This is [PERSON_NAME] with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How are you doing? Good. Is [PERSON_NAME] in? Yes, if you don't mind verifying your phone number for me and I can try to get you right over to [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, perfect. Let me see here. And then. Is it [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. Okay, perfect. Give me one second. I'm going to try to get you over to them. Thank you. No problem. Hey, [PERSON_NAME], are you still with me? Yes. Okay. I just tried to get you over to [PERSON_NAME], but it looks like he has stepped away for just a moment. But. But I would love to help you out. So I see you're bringing in your C class for service, it looks like on Monday, is that right? Yes. Okay, perfect. Well, I know [PERSON_NAME] was definitely trying to reach out to you because our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] has been looking for more of these C class models. And we see you have your [DATE_INTERVAL]. So I'm sure he was wondering, have you considered upgrading? Yeah, but I've got such a good deal on the car. It's. I mean, for what I'm paying, I don't know. I mean, because my payment includes prepaid maintenance. It has the extended warranty, the car payment, the interest rate, and a few other things. And plus it's only got, you know, 20, 29,000 miles on it. Yeah, definitely. And that low mileage is something we are certainly looking for. I mean, if it was something that we could get you a great offer on. Is it something you might be open to if you can come close? A deal like that, I don't know. I mean, that's pretty hard to beat. I mean, a friend of mine was the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] at [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. And like I said, he gave me a smoking deal, so. Yeah, he definitely did. And I know, I know going into kind of that new trade, you would be back under warranty. So that is something that I know we could help out with. But as far as those monthly payments, what are you kind of at right now? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And with that, too. So say it is something that we could kind of make it make sense for you. Would you be wanting to look at another C Class or maybe something a little bit different? Yeah, I mean, like I said, I'd be open to it. It's just like I said, it's a matter of, you know, I don't. I don't know if you guys can beat the deal I got. And plus, I got the tire package on it as well. So if anything happens to my tires or my rims, I just. I get it replaced. All that's wrapped up in that payment. So that's what I mean. He gave me a pretty darn good deal. But that's going to be hard to be. But hey, you know what? If you guys want to try, it doesn't hurt to try, right? Exactly. Well, hey, if you were looking at another C class, is there anything that you wish was kind of different with yours? I know it comes with everything you're looking for, but maybe even feature wise. No, I mean, you know, the newer models just obviously have more upgrades in it, that's all. But. Right. I said it's just. And the car is. It's super clean. I mean, I'm so anal about my cars. I just so. Yeah, like I said, it's. It's in really, really good shape. Yeah. Well, I'm glad that you are kind of keeping it in that great condition with that too. I know you said pretty much there's nothing you can think of, but if there was anything that you would care. Could add into your next C class, is there anything that kind of comes to mind? Not really. I mean, like I said, this is my third one, so it's, you know, I had an E350 coop and then another C class before C300 before this one and then this one's the four Matic. So I'd want to keep that, obviously. I know I don't really want to get an A class. I don't. And like I said, I don't know, it's just going to be a hard deal to beat, that's all. Yes, ma' am. That makes sense to me. And I know you said it is in that good condition and it does have that low mileage as well as you kind of having those different packages. So I know it is something that my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] would be interested in. So let me just ask, when you come in for service on Monday, are you waiting with your vehicle? Are you dropping it off? No, I'm dropping it off and picking up a loaner. That's why I had to wait so long to get the appointment. I know those loaners definitely are pushed out sometimes, so I'm glad you were able to kind of get in with that too. Before you leave, do you think you would have just [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] to meet with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] just to get a value for your vehicle as well as maybe seeing some options if you're interested? Yes, that'd be fine. Okay, perfect. Well, I will let them know kind of what you already have as far as in your current C class and what you're looking for in your next. And when you come in, just let them know that you would want to meet with our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. And that way they can go ahead and connect you with them. Okay? Yeah, that's fine. Right? Perfect. Well, I have you all set on my end. Just make sure when you come in to ask for [PERSON_NAME], and they will take care of you. Okay? All right. Perfect. Thank you so much. No problem at all, [PERSON_NAME]. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. You, too. All right. Bye. Bye. All right. Bye.

Well, here's the deal. So I have, I've been calling around to [ORGANIZATION] and I've been disconnected three times and I've talked to about five different people. And last time I was transferred to one of the people I spoke with before who was trying to point me in the right direction. And so the deal is I bought a [ORGANIZATION] Corolla off your lot about [DURATION] [DURATION] ago and it came with a small warranty and I'm trying to figure out what's included in that warranty. Somebody told me about like oil. The guy I bought the car with, I think he said something about oil changes and other stuff that is included. And so I'm just connecting you on over to [ORGANIZATION] to cover what that warranty comes. Yeah, and they didn't know. They transferred me somewhere else. And so like I'm getting sort of not the runaround necessarily, but [ORGANIZATION] doesn't know. So I need to talk to folks somebody else and I just need to talk to the right person who can explain this warranty to me. But not [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, yeah, apparently not. Which is odd because they're the ones who do that exact thing. Yeah. Cover, warranty, the coverage thereof and everything thereof. So I will get, I will get a message over and we'll get that looked into. However, I am double checking for our [OCCUPATION] because they also can answer that here. Just want to make sure everybody's in today. Okay. Yeah, just a brief hold. I'm going to go ahead and reach out to our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. They also can. And finance.

All right, thank you. Hello, this is [PERSON_NAME] at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Who am I speaking with? This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]? Yep. What can I help you with, sir? Well, I bought a Corolla. I used Corolla off the lot there, I don't know, maybe [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. And, and it came with a warranty and the guy I bought it through, I'm spacing his name right now, said I think that there were some oil changes included and I just kind of wanted to get a handle on what it was and like what the warranty was and if there's anything I'm supposed to schedule or anything I'm supposed to do with it, that kind of thing. He mentioned it and then I forgot about it and then now I'm just trying to remember and get a handle on it. So as far as your oil changes go, you get two free oil changes. So whenever they're Due. You go down to [ORGANIZATION] and get your oil change. Looking at your prospect here, when you say I go. When you say I go down to [ORGANIZATION], what do you mean by that? Like the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] lot? Yes. Okay. So not, not your, not your lot, though. The, the, the. The main lot. Yes. Yes. Okay. And from my understanding, other than that, there was no warranty purchased on the vehicle. No, I didn't. I didn't purchase a warranty, but I did get sent something in the mail from you guys. And it. So there's something, you know, I just don't know. I just don't know what it is. What it is. So you do have a [DURATION] [DURATION], 3,000 mile powertrain warranty. Okay. [DURATION] [DURATION]. That. Yeah. I'm going to cover your internally lubricated parts of your engine, transmission and drive axles. Engine, transmission and drive axles. Okay. And so beyond that and the two free oil changes, does the two free oil changes have to happen within a certain amount of time? Within 15,000 miles? Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. And that's. That's it then? That's it, right? That is it, sir. Okay. All right. Okay. The, the, the, the stuff you guys sent me in the mail said something about roadside assistance. Is there any of that or. No? Yep. You'll have [DURATION] [DURATION] of road roadside assistance. So if something goes wrong, you can call roadside assistance and they'll help you out if you break down or whatever the case may be. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. That's what I was after. Just trying to get a handle on what this is. All righty. Okay. Thanks very much for your help. I appreciate it. No problem.

All righty, let me check here. I see it out there. Okay, what's your questions? Information you can give me on it if it's still available. If that [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], my warranty still on it. Any accident, Any accidents? Okay, no problem. Let's see, what will it say? Do you see it? Carfax settings. Carfax. Okay. And you live here in [LOCATION]? I'm in [LOCATION]. [PERSON_NAME]. You're in [LOCATION]. Okay. And. And your, your phone. [PHONE_NUMBER] in case we get disconnected. Okay. Yeah. And your name?

I'm just firing up my computer here and I could send you a link from our actual website too that way if you need that. Yeah, I'd be easier to. Probably be easier to scroll. Yeah, yeah, no, I'm with you. Okay, it's a [ORGANIZATION]. And there it is. So it's a three quarter ton, 2500 heavy duty and then. Okay, here we go. All right. So as for warranty wise, that thing has [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And the express vans come with the [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], a [DURATION] [DURATION] 60. So the remaining warranty on that vehicle now it is certified. So that means the way that works is you're going to have at least a [DURATION] [DURATION] bumper to bumper or 12,000 miles, whatever comes first from today's different. The date that you buy it. And then it'll have up to a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles, [DURATION] [DURATION] from the original date that it was sold. Okay. Then you know, so you, it's from the original date. So the original. Now if you go on here, if you go into the Carfax and you click on that and then you go into buyer, buyer warranty check, then it'll tell you the date approximately. It's not right on the dot, but it's pretty darn close. That vehicle was sold [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL]. So around about [DURATION] [DURATION] from that. You'll, you'll the. Or the 100,000 miles is when it will expire quite a bit. You'll probably get to the miles before you get to the [DURATION] on this scenario. Now there is no basic warranty. You will, but you will have that [DURATION] [DURATION] or 12,000 mile zero deductible from the factory. That will be covered because you're certified. It's certified. I'm gonna wrap it. My stuff like crazy. My guys are putting on like three or four thousand miles [DURATION] [DURATION]. That's crazy. Okay, yeah, so you'll, you'll eat up that. But at least you'll be covered for at least [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION], whatever, bumper to bumper. And then after that that powertrain will go to 100,000 miles. Yeah, okay. Yeah.

I'm the one that hits the road and buys vehicles all the time also. So he wanted me to kind of really take a look at it and I'll do the inspection and look over it. Not what not. But they're all about the same price once you get in the same [DURATION], the same mileage. You know, I think the certification, they're not all certified, huh? Yeah. No, the other one was too, about the same price. It was a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] less, but. But it had like 5,000 miles more, so, you know. But it was certified. Yeah, certified.

So if we get all the protections, how much we have to pay for that? But it's going to be around [MONEY_AMOUNT], so around [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So MSRP starts around [MONEY_AMOUNT].

For [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PHONE_NUMBER], wait while I transfer your call. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME], how can I help you today? Hi, Mr. [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm interested in a [ORGANIZATION], well obviously [ORGANIZATION] in an HRV Sport. And I'm wondering just like generally the cars that you have on the lot, what the MSRP is on that or you know, what the out the door price is on the, on those. Yeah. So let me see, for the new HRVs we're looking at around, is there a particular trim pack? Yeah, the Sport. The Sport. Okay, pull up my info center here real quick. Okay. And okay, so the Sport is the mid trend level for this year's model. So from what I know, the Sport should probably be around the upper 20k to the early 30k range out the door. That should be inclusive of all like taxes, fees, accessories. Actually, I don't think they're running the accessory add on anymore. It'd just be the dot fee and the auto tax. So upper 20k. Okay. So I went to another [ORGANIZATION] dealership and for the Sport they were saying that it's like it's been customary for [ORGANIZATION] dealerships to just arbitrarily add like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] on the way out the door. So you're saying that like it's just taxes and fees typically. I think there might still be a market adjustment on there. Now that's, I don't know if the word typical is really the word I would use for that. It's more so that it's dependent on how the market's fluctuating. Lately we've been getting more in, so inventory is a bit more open up. They might not be as stubborn with that and they might not have it as high as they used to. I can't really speak to what the current market adjustment is if there is one, because I handle deals directly over here in my department. Yeah, I mean I would just before coming in, I would just want to have a sense that I would be within a certain range or like that I, I wouldn't be like upsold by [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] on a car. So we were talking like [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] at the summer dealership. Was trying to, I mean, I, I don't know, like what market fluctuation, like what the range is typically or like what the range can be, but. Yeah, as high as [MONEY_AMOUNT] over. But I don't think we're currently running that. That large of a markup. I think they've. They brought it down, especially on the HRVs. And I do know they also are running a lot of sales right now trying to get vehicles out as close to MSRP as we can due to the summer sales event coming up. So that is something we are pushing right now until [DATE] [DATE], I believe. Yeah, that's the. So they might be able to do a little better deal for you during the current event. I'd be able to set up some time for you if you want to come in sometime in the next [DURATION] days to talk numbers on that. Yeah, and they'd be able to give you exact numbers on the lot as well, whereas I don't have that here in my end. Okay, excellent. I'm gonna. I'm chat with my [MARITAL_STATUS] to figure out a time when we can come in and I'll give you a call back. Yeah, just let me know. I'll be able to get a time shot reserve so someone's ready to eat when you'll get here. Okay, excellent. What's your name again? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay.

Okay, one moment please. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm in the market for a new [ORGANIZATION] M8 for a lease. Sure. Or did you find something on our website or you're just. No, I've shopped with you guys in the past. I got a Range Rover through you guys [DURATION] ago. It might have been a different [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], but I think it was [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, no problem. All right, so let me just take a look, see what we have in stock. And you're looking for the grand coupe. Well, Coop is probably the highest preferential. And then the gran coupe. And then convertible. Okay, and then convertible. We're open to 23 lease percent. You know, lease returns, something that has low mileage that you guys have on in stock. Okay, so you're looking for a pre owned car then, not a new one? Well, a new one, but if you have any good deals on potentially a low mileage lease return, we'd be interested in getting the numbers on that too. Understood. Well, we only have one M8, but it's a convertible. It's a lease return that actually just came in not too long ago. I'm not sure if you're open to that, but I believe it's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. I don't know if you want to take a look at something like that, but I can send it to you. And what's your name? What's the combo on that white one? What's the interior? Let me see. When? I don't think it's white. Hold on one second, let me just take a look. I'm almost sure it's a red one. I think it's [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Yeah, [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. No, no, no, that's fine. No, okay, no worries. We can take a look at a new one. Let me just see what we have incoming to see if there's anything that would work by. When do you need it? Are you looking to get something like today or do we have some time? We have a little bit of time. I mean, I'd like to move on it, but it's not, it's not urgent. I need to sign something up today. Understood. All right, so let me just take a look at the Coop first. I know I have some convertibles and stock, but we can figure that out. Okay, so the only 23s that I have left are convertibles. I can put something together on that. If not, it's going to have to be a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Is that okay? You have coops in the [DATE_INTERVAL]? Let me check on that. Hold on. Let me see what the [DATE_INTERVAL] look like. Okay, I only have one that's incoming. But no, it's not a coop. It's only a grand coupe. The Coop. We're going to have to order that. That's just going to take a little bit of time because the only one that I have, it's actually produced. Not shrimp. It's a gray with a Black Gran Coupe [DATE_INTERVAL]. Would that work for you? A gray with a black interior. What kind of gray? It's a skyscraper gray, so it's more of a lighter gray. It's a new color for [ORGANIZATION]. Came out possibly like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Maybe I can send you a picture. I have the [LOCATION] gray, which is a very light gray. I like that. Yeah, but that's a convertible. I have two in stock 23s. We could give you a very good deal for the end of the month on those if you're open to a convertible. We have them right on the website so I can send you some photos so you can take a look. Yeah, we'll take a look at that if it's on the website. I think my friend's looking at it right now. He's looking for it. Yeah, yeah, that's the one. Let me just see.

And then are you looking to put any money down and how many miles per [DURATION] would you need? 7,500 miles. I would do 7,500 miles and [DURATION] [DURATION]. Unless [DURATION] [DURATION] is more attractive. Sometimes they get more attractive on [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yes. Sometimes I think the best program is [DURATION], but I would check with the desk and the [OCCUPATION] to see what more or less would work. Okay.

Let me just see if they're both the same color. So one's [MONEY_AMOUNT] and the other one's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Do you want me to work it on the [MONEY_AMOUNT] instead? Yeah, that's the MSRP. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, perfect. All right, so let me work up the difference between the two cars. Yes. Let me just see. What exactly is the difference of [MONEY_AMOUNT]? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. This one has the driver's assistance pro neck warmer. [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. I want to say that it's the sound system and the M exterior carbon package. Let me see if the other one has all that. It seems like. Seems like it's the same options. I'm going to run the spec sheet, and I will let the [OCCUPATION] know, and they'll let you know what the difference is. But the MSRP is roughly different for sure. So one has to have more options than the other. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to work on this. Just give me a bit. Okay, got it. Thank you. Thank you. No problem. All right. Bye.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, how's it going? I was hoping you could maybe answer a question for me. So I live in [LOCATION], and I'm looking at your website right now.

Do you happen to have the stock number or [DURATION] make I can look up? Okay, let me pull up my screen. It's a pre owned car? Yes, sir. Okay, what is the last eight of that VIN for six. The last six should be [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID]. What about the. What's the two digits before that? It should be two letters. [VEHICLE_ID]. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. That's not pulling in my inventory. Does it. Does it show you any kind of stock number or anything or what type of car? What [DURATION] is it?

Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for calling. [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. How may I assist you? Hi, I missed a call from [ORGANIZATION].

All right? Okay. Okay, thank you. Best number is [PHONE_NUMBER], is that right? Yes, exactly. Yep. Okay, I'm going to transfer you. I think you talked to the [PERSON_NAME] or [PERSON_NAME] left a message for you. So I'm going to. One second. All right, hold on a second. Okay, thanks so much. Thank you. Bye. Hi, good morning. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. I just giving you a call back about that [ORGANIZATION] CRV hybrid. Yes, yes, thank you. That was quick. Thank you for calling me back. Yeah, no problem. I was actually just on the other line talking to, you know, [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] to help with my current vehicle. So, yeah, thanks for giving me a call. Absolutely. Yeah. Is that. Is that the vehicle you're replacing? The one you're talking about? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like, I've had the same car. I bought a new. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Outback. How's that been? How's that been going? Oh, it's been great. I've loved the car. You know, was tempted and still considering a [ORGANIZATION] because I've had such a positive experience. But I really like the idea of a hybrid. And through all my research, the CR V just really seems like a great option. Yeah, it's top of its class. I mean, if it was in high school, it'd be a valedictorian. It is a great car. Have you driven one? Have you got to experience one yet? No. And I live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], so I was considering going over. There's one that's used over here in town. So I was considering about test driving one just to get. You know, My boyfriend assures me that it's a good idea to test drive things before you buy them. Absolutely. Boyfriends know everything. Yeah. Yeah. And I can be slightly impulsive in that way, especially because I do a lot of research. And so I'm like, well, everything I read, it sounds. Sounds positive. But you never. You never know. But right now I feel. I feel like very much like that this could be a great car for. For me. Yeah. Yeah. And I noticed that you chose the touring model, which has, like, the leather seats, all the bells and whistles. Is that kind of the route you wanted to go. I mean, I actually don't need that. I think it was like hard through the website, like I don't know what kind of. It seemed like it had limited options. I don't need the touring model for me, you know, like a pretty basic one is fine. Yeah. All right, that sounds good. Yeah, it's a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] difference. I mean it's quite a savings to just go with the regular sport model. Yeah, regular sport model is honestly great. So tell me what you are, what are you trying to accomplish? Are you, do you own your [ORGANIZATION] outright? Are you trying to finance or just, you know, what needs? Oh, yes, so I do, yeah. I've owned my [ORGANIZATION] outright for a while. And I mean, it depends on what's more beneficial cost wise for me because I have the money to buy cash up front or like if it's. Sometimes it's more advantageous to finance. So I can do really either one. I don't know if you recommend doing one over the other if there's one that's better on your end in terms of you're like, oh, actually we have a good finance deal and, and yeah, we prefer that method. I don't know. But I can do cash up front. Yeah, well, you know, cash up front is always the best way to buy, right. Zero interest, walk away, no payments. But we do have some good programs right now with financing. Now interest rates, mind you, are kind of high. Nationwide you can go as low as 3.9 through [ORGANIZATION]. But we also have some credit unions that are very aggressive right now that also want to, you know, they want to eat as well. And coming in with, you know, quarter of a point, half a point less than [ORGANIZATION], if you're open to that. Yeah, I mean, I guess I agree with you. Like, I'd prefer no interest, of course, because in the long run I'll save money. Um, and so that's probably the route that I would go is just an upfront cash. Cash deal. Yeah. That's the best way to buy. Absolutely. Yeah. I kind of have had money squirreled away for a while now for this purpose, you know, having. Having an older car. Yeah, I'm definitely a planner, so. So yeah, I have it ready to go for this reason. That's awesome. Well, I'm happy to work with you. I've actually got two of these two different colors coming in here in the next couple weeks. One of them is a still night pearl. Do you have the color schemes or are you on. I did look at, I Did check them out and. Yeah, like, I have, like, my favorite, but I also am, like, for the interest of time, like, okay with something. Something different. So that one was like the kind of traditional silver, if you will. Yeah, there's a silver as well. I like the one that's kind of like matte gray. Let me see what it's called. Like if I. Yeah, like if I. Yeah, that's exactly it. That's. If I had my. If I had my first choice, that's what it would be. Yeah, that's good looking. I love that. I love that color. Yeah, me too. So, yeah, I'll have to. I can look back on. On the color schemes. Yeah. Yep. But what was the. So you definitely want to go, you know, hybrid, right? That's definitely the route that you're wanting to take? Yeah. Okay. Just wondering if you would be open to a gasoline model. Just curious. I mean, there's a potential for it, but I think I'd rather do hybrid just in the interest of. Yeah, I mean, 40 miles to the gallon sounds pretty attractive for at least city miles. I know. No, in the city, yes. Because on the highway there's identical, you know, and the hybrid, I think they're both 32 miles gallon. They're [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, I know, I noticed that. It kind of surprised me. But, you know, but at least. Or at least this one actually is even saying 43 for city, 36 for highway. So, yeah, pretty darn good. The only reason I ask is because I actually have an urban grade coming in. But it's the gas only model. I've got one of those coming in. It's in the ex. The EX model, which is a very well rounded trim level. It's got the sunroof, the heated seats, blind spot to name a few things. But cloth seats, when does that come in? So that one. Let me look at my incoming list. Give me a second. Pull that up. Because currently, right now, I don't have any that are coming in in that urban gray for hybrid. But let me look here. Thanks for your patience while I look this up. Are you working or are you off? No, I mean, I've got flexibility in my schedule, so. Awesome. All right, I've got it pulled up here. I just want to make sure I wasn't keeping you from work. Let's see, I've got urban gray. Just got. Just got the ETA today. Perfect. So I've got it coming in right around between the [DATE] and the [DATE]. Looks like it's about [DURATION]. About [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] out. Currently, nobody has a deposit on it, so it is available. And what's the price on the gasoline model? Yeah, yeah, let me pull that up. With the urban gray, that looks good. Actually less than The Hybrid, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [PHONE_NUMBER] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay, great. And then to just go back, jump back to the hybrid, you were saying there's two colors that were coming in. Yeah, yeah. So the color that's coming in is still night pearl. Still night pearl is a very blue color. It's like a true blue, like crayon blue. Okay. I think it. Yeah. Okay. But it's, you know, it's like a blue metallic. So I've got that one and I also have the silver. Okay. I definitely prefer the silver. Is it the lunar silver? Yep, exactly. That actually looks really good too, with the. With the black wheels and the black roof rails. Yeah, it does look good. And. And for that lunar one, is it the. Just the standard model? It's the touring. Touring. I got a white one that's coming in that platinum white pearl that's coming in that. The regular sport model. And so could you mention the prices for those two? The difference? Yep. So the regular sport model, if you went. Let's say you went with the white. Just hypothetically speaking, you'd be looking at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And then if you went with a touring, which does not disappoint, I will mention that. I mean, you get quite a bit of extras for that extra little bit of up charge. But if you did go that route, let's just say that maybe you went with the still night pearl. That would be [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the hybrid sport touring. Okay. And then the dates on those two vehicles. Pull that up. The date. So if you went with the white one, that's the sport. The hybrid sport with the quad seats, that one is looking like it's going to be the first, the second. Wait, looks like between [DATE] [DATE] and [DATE] [DATE]. Okay. And then if you went with the sport touring, you'll get those a lot quicker. The silver one is coming in between the [DATE] and [DATE] [DATE]. If you went with the blue metallic, it'd be between the [DATE] and the [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Okay. All righty. Well, that's really good food for thought. And yeah, like I said, I'm going to test drive the older model here in town and then I could get back to you on any thoughts how to proceed? Yeah, absolutely. And you know, I could reach out in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Or I could reach out the first part of next [DURATION]. What do you prefer? How about the first part of next [DURATION]? Sounds good. Yeah. Monday or Tuesday? Monday works. Monday works. Perfect. Yeah, anytime. Anytime works. Yeah, that's great. You got it. You got it. Well, listen, what I'll do, I'll send you an email to the email address you provided. You could probably just do my personal. Okay, so first name? [PERSON_NAME]. Yep, that's right. [PERSON_NAME], right? Yep, that's right. All right, fantastic. Well, thanks so much for your help today. I'm actually getting a work call now, but I look forward to hearing from you next [DURATION]. All right, that sounds good. I'll talk to you then. Have a great [DURATION]. All right, thanks. Okay, thanks.

How flexible are they on that price? So we do list it at best price. I mean, we want to remain competitive in a market where, you know, it is so easy to buy and shop online. That being said, I don't think we're going to lose you over $[MONEY_AMOUNT] or so. I don't know, you know, what they're going to have as far as room to make a deal, but that would be where we would want you to come see the vehicle, come check it out and let's see what we can get done. Yeah, because I'm looking. I don't want to be any more than [MONEY_AMOUNT] out the door. You know, that's everything. Out the door. Close. Yeah. I mean, considering the vehicle is already priced at [MONEY_AMOUNT], I mean, that's where it's going to be a little tough because we have taxes, fees included on that or excluded from that price. But I mean, we'll do what we can. I mean, I don't know if we're going to be able to get to that number exactly. But yeah, that's where I mean, your presence is your leverage for getting a deal done. So. All right, I'd like to come up and see it. Let me see, today's Tuesday. How about tomorrow? What's the earliest I could come in and see it tomorrow? So we open the doors at [TIME] we're here from [TIME] to [TIME] weekdays. And then Saturday, we're here from [TIME] to [TIME]. But tomorrow we would open the doors at [TIME]. Okay, so if I can be there at like, [TIME], [TIME]. Do I just ask for you? So sorry. They're doing some construction in here if it gets loud. So, [PERSON_NAME], I would have you asking for my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. His name is [PERSON_NAME]. And he would get you set up with, you know, one of our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. I don't work, like, direct. Like, I work on the charity club. I don't actually handle the sale of the vehicle. So I would just get you set up by the right people. [PERSON_NAME] would be who I'd be asking for when he got here. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Will you be able to text that to me so I don't forget? Absolutely. Yes, sir. All right. Yeah, I'd like to come in and see him tomorrow morning and see if they'll do the price I'm looking to be out the door with. Like I said, I'm paying cash. No financing or nothing. Absolutely. Yeah. And I mean, our goal is to get the deal done, so hopefully we can get something worked out and try to get this all, you know, taken care of for you tomorrow morning. All right. Is this the dealership right by the [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] right there on the corner? Correct? Yes, sir. Okay. So, all right, I will come see you guys tomorrow morning and I'll ask for [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, sir. All right. [PERSON_NAME], I appreciate your help. My pleasure.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON_NAME] speaking. How can I help you? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I just missed a call from you all. Oh, gotcha. Let me take a look, find out who reached out. What's a good phone number for you? Thank you. Okay. Ms. [PERSON_NAME]? Yes, perfect. Okay. Yeah. So it looks like [PERSON_NAME] had reached out. I see you had inquired about our [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Fe ultimate, is that correct? Oh, no, I would never drive that. Okay, fair enough. Are you looking for a new vehicle? Yes, I wanted a foreign. Okay, and then which one you kind of have your eyes on? [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, so looking at an [ORGANIZATION] Q7, have you Q7. Okay. Have you considered a [ORGANIZATION] GV80? What is that? So [ORGANIZATION], Just like how [ORGANIZATION] has Lexus, [ORGANIZATION] has [ORGANIZATION]. So relatively new. So it doesn't have like the same pedigree as like the [NATIONALITY] manufacturers or even other manufacturers. But they are. But yeah, they are winning every possible award you could ever imagine. And we do have one in stock. It's called a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] gz. What's the website? You should be able to just go to [URL] or [URL] if you want to go to our website. Never mind. [ORGANIZATION]. No, that is the wrong one. [ORGANIZATION] Z. Yes. So it's the same segment like the [ORGANIZATION] Q7, your [ORGANIZATION] X5, that sort of thing, plus third row seating. Third row seating is available in the advanced package. Well, I think I need some advanced features. Right. It looks beautiful. It is. So they got the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] from [ORGANIZATION] and they convinced him to come over and they essentially gave him an entire car brand. And then they got [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] from [ORGANIZATION] who was the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] for about [DURATION] [DURATION] and he's the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. So you have one of [ORGANIZATION] top [OCCUPATION] and [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] coming together and that's what they created. It's beautiful. Do you have black with peanut butter interior? The one on the website unfortunately is mislabeled. It's black with a black interior. But the Dune is absolutely stunning. And that, honestly, that's my personal favorite interior that they make. Let me see if, if I can pull that up here. So we have a lot coming between now and the [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. So I just wanted to see. Yeah, so we have the. We have a 3.5 GV80 prestige in stock, which is the top [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] top, biggest motor, most features, but it will not have the third row seating. So I don't know if that's a must have for you. I mean, the one we have here still drives the same. So if you just go to [PERSON_NAME]. [ORGANIZATION]. Where did it go? Hold on. [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. Fellow [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Correct. Okay. I've never heard of a [ORGANIZATION]. This is my first time. Well, I'll tell you, it's definitely the fastest growing luxury brand out there because people are starting to really catch on. Like I said, the GV80 took the SUV [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [DURATION]. Oh, that's the car that [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] drove off the mountain in. When he drove off the mountain. That's the one. That's the one that he was driving. Wow. I mean, yeah, so that's the one that saved [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. But yeah. If you, if you're wondering why it looks like [ORGANIZATION] Bentayga. Yeah, that thing, it. Dude, it's incredible. These are expensive. So the one that's on our website, that is the very top trim level. So it literally cannot get any more equipped than that. Now if you're okay, if you're not doing like a ton of towing or anything like that, the 2.5 is an option as well, which is like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] less even in the top trim level. But yeah, it's definitely our luxury product. Without a doubt. Who's going to pray for one of these? You have to have Super Goober Goober. Perfect. Well, you know, I mean, compared to a Q7, they're actually pretty comparable in pricing. Like I said, An SQ7 Prestige would definitely be more than that. Even so they're comparable. Well, I have one. I want another one. Yeah, for sure. Hey, great cars. Big thing with the [ORGANIZATION] though, they do have like pretty much double the warranty that [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] offer. So that's certainly a big advantage. Okay, let's give me it. I want it. Okay, let's do it. But yeah, hey, like I said, we got one in stock that you're more than welcome to check out and looks like you have 1, 2, 3. So we got about nine more coming in the next [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, I want one today. Can you run me for it today? Yeah, I mean, I can send you over like pricing information if everything kind of looks good. I'll try to get a quick video if it's out there and then we can just kind of go from there. Now you had mentioned a lease. How many miles? Okay, fair enough. How many miles per [DURATION] would you need on a lease? 40 on our own. So typical lease is going to be between 10 and 15,000 miles per [DURATION]. I'm going to drive more than that. Okay. So we may want to consider on your current vehicle. You know, honestly, they're. These days they're about the same historically. Yeah. Leases have always been, you know, a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] cheaper, [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] cheaper, but these days are almost identical. So there's no benefits of getting a lease over buying? Not so much these days. It's definitely kind of leveled out in the last [DURATION] [DURATION], but I can take a look at both and. Okay, it doesn't matter. I just want one ready for a new car. Okay. So I'll get some pricing put together for you. So I'll work up a high mileage lease and I'll do a purchase as well if. Were you planning on putting any money down Pardon me? Were you planning on putting any money down for your next vehicle purchase? Yep. Can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear me? Caller has hung up. Please enter your phone code.",failure,price_quote,GV80,high,True,0dd9d98dc4d2426f955d9d600c9df863_transcript.json
"Thanks for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME], who had the pleasure of speaking with. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. How are you? I'm doing good, Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. What can I help you out with today? So I'm just wondering. I don't want to actually go into the store. I just want to see if you guys are able. If I'm. If I can send in, like, do it online. A. Like sending an app, like, you know, pre approval to see if I can be approved for anything before going in. Okay. What is it you're trying to get approved for, Ms. [PERSON_NAME]? Well, I have [DURATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Civic that I want to trade in. I just want to see if I can get in to [DURATION] bigger car. Okay. Do you still owe money on the [ORGANIZATION] Civic? Yeah, it doesn't have any like. Like market value. I don't know if that's something like that. They told me. Okay, Last name is [PERSON_NAME]. It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. All right, now you're looking to get into something bigger. So you said it's an [DATE_INTERVAL] Civic? Yeah, [DATE_INTERVAL] Civic. How long have you had it for? Maybe like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. You've had it. What are the payments on that civic, Ms. [PERSON_NAME]? I pay [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh, you get it so low. Okay, any. You said you're looking to get something bigger? Something like an suv? Anything like. Yeah, like an SUV doesn't have. I don't want it brand new. Maybe something [DURATION] little bit older like RAV Ford. Okay. Is there [DURATION] payment I'm trying to accomplish at all? If we can stay in the [MONEY_AMOUNT] or lower, that would be amazing. Oh, yeah, I hear you. I can't imagine happening, but I'll fight my hardest for you. So the goal is to. You basically want to do [DURATION] credit at Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, but I have really bad credit. And that's no problem. I can work on that for you. Yeah, but, you know, [ORGANIZATION] had approved me for like, [DURATION] Civic. It actually was in [DURATION] court, but it was like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So I don't know how they approved it. So maybe you guys can do the same magic. Well, yeah, we do have [MONEY_AMOUNT] cars here on our lot. So we definitely have [DURATION] car that you approve for. So credit is not too much to issue. How much was it you owe on the [DATE_INTERVAL] Civic? You said about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. No, no, no. 10. Oh, you only owe 10, so that's really good. So it sounds like your car has some equity in it. How many miles are on it? No equity. That's what they told me. It's at 121. Okay, so it does have some miles on it. 121, about 10k. Who is it financed with? [PERSON_NAME]. That Baint. Okay, [PERSON_NAME]. All right. I mean, in order to get, like, I can show you what [DURATION] vehicle we prove for, but in order to like, really put it all together, I wouldn't need you here so I can appraise your car. That would be one thing, too. And I know you said credit isn't the best, which is no problem at all, and you said you have [DURATION] little bit of negative equity, which, like I said, we can work with there. Was there any money down you were looking to put towards another vehicle at all? Not really. Like, I'm. I really don't want to. I just want to give that car up and to see if I can get into another one, you know, with the same payments. Because I think [MONEY_AMOUNT] is [DURATION] lot to be paying [DURATION] [DURATION]. Oh, it is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's definitely [DURATION] decent payment. I won't say it's cheap or really high. I definitely see people pay [DURATION] little bit more, believe it or not, on worse vehicles. I mean, but if you could pay [MONEY_AMOUNT] on like [DURATION] car with less miles. Nor [DURATION]. I get that. Exactly. That's my. That's my main goal. Like, I need something with less miles, more secure. Maybe some. Some warranty on there. All of our cars are certified, too, with lifetime powertrain warranty and pl. I mean, [ORGANIZATION] is the best, you know. Well, let me help you out. I got you, Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. I mean, so do you want to fill out [DURATION] credit app? And like I said, from there I could tell you everything. That'll kind of line up in the budget we're trying to be around. I want to do it, but if I can send it in through you guys, I mean, it'll honestly be [DURATION] lot easier if we just. It's [DURATION] [DURATION] right here on the phone, and then I can just go to my computer, my [PERSON_NAME] computer. He can kind of plug in some stuff and we'll be there. I'll call you right back and I could be. To tell you everything. Yeah, I can send it right now. No, no, I'm saying, like, if I. We can fill it out right here on the phone. It'll take literally less than [DURATION] [DURATION] and then I can. That'll be it right there. All right. Yeah, let's do it over the phone. All right. It was Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, that's right. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. Damn, that's good. That's good. It popped or something. No, no, no. I remember I asked you your first and last name, so I just want to make sure I spelled it right. Oh, okay. Yeah, definitely. You did, for sure. When's your date of birth? [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. Huh. [ZODIAC_SIGN]. Yeah. Can I get your driver's license, license number, Ms. [PERSON_NAME]? My what? License number. Driver's license number. Yeah, let me hear. One second. Alrighty. [DRIVERS_LICENSE], [DRIVERS_LICENSE], [DRIVERS_LICENSE]. What's the expiration date? Expiration date? Oh, wait. No, no, no. One moment, one moment, one moment. You good? It's probably. Yeah. [CREDIT_CARD_EXPIRATION] [CREDIT_CARD_EXPIRATION]. Oh, my God. My license expires this [DURATION]. Are you [MARITAL_STATUS] or anything, Ms. [PERSON_NAME]? No. Okay. What's your current address? It's gonna be [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [PERSON_NAME] [LOCATION]. Can you spell [PERSON_NAME] for me? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. All right. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [PERSON_NAME] [LOCATION]. Is that it? Yeah, [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay, [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. What's the city? [LOCATION], [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. How long you been living there for? Oh, we just moved like, [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Do you want, like, my previous. It's still my mailing address. Okay, that's fine. What's your previous address as well? Okay, it's going to be [LOCATION]. Okay. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. All right. [LOCATION], [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. We were here for [DURATION] [DURATION]. All right. Do you live with family, friends or owner? Rent? I rent, but, yeah, I rent. Okay. So are there some utility bills of some sort in your name? No, everything's included. Included in what? In the rent. Okay. Because, like, just, like, in case the bank may ask for, like, proof of residency. And by proof of residency, that's like [DURATION] bill to that address you're currently living at. So if [DURATION] bill. If there. If the bank asks for [DURATION] bill of where you're currently living at, whose name would it say is under? The only bill I would get in my name there, because my man pays the bill. Would be the [ORGANIZATION] bill, like Internet? The only thing that comes in my name. Okay, that's perfect. So how much do you pay in rent per [DURATION]? He pays [MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right. How much is the [ORGANIZATION] bill? I think it's like $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Yeah. All right. And how much do you make per [DURATION] or every two [DURATION]? Every two [DURATION]. After tax or gross? After tax, Gross. Are you in sales? No, no, no, no. I work for the. Like, the government. Okay. Yeah. After taxes. After taxes, it's like [MONEY_AMOUNT] every two [DURATION]. Yeah. Okay. Do you have any other source of income at all? No, just that. All right. Full time? Part time?

Because I'm talking about [DURATION] [DURATION] ago and you know, it was at a higher amount. They said that was kind of using the dealership financing. Yeah, the way we price them online is we if you're trading something in, if you're financing, we give you the best price. So I may be trading something in. Not 100% sure on that, but I was going to come with my own financing as far as. I'm a member of a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Oh yeah, we do that a lot. Yeah. Do you know when you'd be available to come in? I'm about to run to the bank. Confirm.

"Good afternoon. Thank you for calling. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How can I direct your call? I'm [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, thanks for calling. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How can I help you? Hi, I got a question. I purchased a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Optima from you guys. I think it was almost [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. [DURATION]. And I owe about [MONEY_AMOUNT] on the loan right now. But I'm having some problems with the car. So I wanted to know what my options were. The car keeps trying to cut off on me, so I've gotten it fixed, but I'm just trying right now. I'm just looking to get out the car right now. What would be my option? You said you owe about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it? Yeah. How many miles is on your vehicle? 60,804. You could try to get out of it. You could just break it into us and we could trade it in for you, get you out of that. Get you something different. Okay. My other question is. Okay, so my credit score is around a [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Is that okay? Yeah, that's fine. You could. With [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], you can lease or finance. No, I don't want a lease because I drive a lot. But the thing is, I'm in [LOCATION]. I live in [LOCATION] now. Yeah. And the car keeps trying to shut up on me. So I'm just like. I don't. I've been dealing with you guys since I bought two Kias from you so far. So you're the only dealership I'm used to dealing with. So are there any other options? Is there a dealership down here? Or let's say if my car. If it clunked out on me on my way there, would you guys help me get to you or. I'm not sure if there's a dealership out there. You can look it up and see if there's any key dealerships closer to you. But if you want to come deal with us, you'll probably have to get your vehicle towed here and then we get it appraised that way for you. Okay. Okay. And what are your. What are you currently paying [DURATION] [DURATION]? I pay [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Mm. Okay. I kind of want to stay around the same range that I've been. Like, right now I pay [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the. The note and my insurance is roughly around like [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So were you looking for something new or pre owned again? Newer. Newer. So we. We can [MONEY_AMOUNT] help you out. But I do want to let you know that prices have gone up. So if you're paying [MONEY_AMOUNT] for that vehicle, you're probably going to be paying a little bit more for a newer car. So I just want you to be aware of that. What about a used car? Used cars, we could probably get you around the same price point. We just have to go to a used car with a little bit miles on it. Great condition. That still gets you from A to B. So when you say it'll be a little bit more. I know you can't keep enough indefinite until you actually pull the. Pull the credit and do the numbers. Yes. So like how much more do you think a note would be if it's. If I'm paying [MONEY_AMOUNT] now for the price of a vehicle and then I know the rollover or how does that work with a. What I can tell you is, so I will actually have to see the vehicle in person as well to get the appraisal amount. But what I can tell you is we have a vehicle that took the optimal's place. It's called the [ORGANIZATION] K5. So it's about the same size, just a little bit more luxurious. I would say that vehicle right now you're looking at about [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that's roughly where you'll be at before the rollover. So depending on how much money you're rolling over, you range from, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] below [MONEY_AMOUNT] to mid [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And that's depending on credit as well. Unexpected. Yeah, everything is high right now. What I like to tell people is, you know, everything is going up and they're just going to keep going up. Good thing about if you're financing a vehicle is you can always refinance it when things start to get better. So when you refinance, you get a better interest rate, lower monthly payment, and still be driving the car that you love driving. So it's just a little tough when people are coming from a lower monthly payment. Like they're used to the [MONEY_AMOUNT] to 300amonth and not a lot of those exist anymore. Right. Like I said, you're. If you're financing, you. You do have options to, to eventually get to where you want to be at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What. Okay, so the, the car. What is the name of the car again that took a place of [ORGANIZATION]? It's a [ORGANIZATION] K5. Oh, the K5. Okay. All righty. What about this? Where's the other one? It's with a finger. Is that the name? I'm sorry, I'm sorry if I'm butchering your name. No, no, you're good. You're good. I'm not offended. But you got it right? It is the Stinger. Yep. The [ORGANIZATION] Stinger, that's one of our sport vehicles. They actually stopped production on those. They were a little too fast, I guess and those vehicles were going anywhere from like 54 to 60,000. Okay, and what about the Telluride? Telluride is our three row SUV. We have a couple of those here now, but those are going to be at most high sevens below eights before rollover. Right now I have a [ORGANIZATION] Sorento which is a steel three row SUV. It's one step under and I'm at [MONEY_AMOUNT] for that financing. So the, the K5, does that have that anti theft software on there? Because the [ORGANIZATION], you know that's like a high theft carve now. Yep. So you have that, you also have tracking chips in your vehicle and you have a phone application that you can receive as well that's free for [DURATION] [DURATION] that tracks your vehicle. It's pretty much like a find my iPhone book for your car. So let's say randomly had his doors unlocked. You would get notified and you could take, you could figure out what's going on with the car. You can lock your car door or you can actually send it to the authorities and authorities can see where your car is at and come take it to a look at it, see what's going on. Okay, and the K5, what colors do you have? Oh, let me see. Give me one second. Right now we have a blue with this luxury brown interior that just came in. No, I'm grabbing a white one right now. Well, let me see because we might have something else coming in down the pipeline that you know, you might be a little bit more interested in. Is it, is it that royal blue color? Is that the color you're talking about? Like a royal blue? It's called sapphire blue. If you go on our website at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and then in the search bar type in K5, I'm pretty sure we have pictures of it on our site. Yep, we do. Only thing is, this is a higher term. So the payment would be just a little. It'll be higher on this one with the K5. Yeah, the one that we have right now. Yeah, it's a higher term. So it's gonna have pretty much everything, all the bells and whistles. But we have another model coming in [DATE_INTERVAL] that'd be black on black, that'd be a low trim. So that'd get you around that [MONEY_AMOUNT] range that I was telling you about. Oh, you say [DATE_INTERVAL]? Yeah, it'll be here in [DATE_INTERVAL]. Oh, no. It's tough. Not a lot of cars are hitting the lots right now, man. I guess I just need to service the car then. Or come and see what you guys. I would say I don't want to. I don't want you. Truthfully, if you owe [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it, I don't want you to put too much more money into that car. Right. Eventually, you're gonna be putting money towards something that's not worth as much as you're putting into it when you could just use that money as a down payment or something, if that's what you wanted to do. So I would say save that. I'm assuming that might be your only vehicle right now to get you from A to B. Okay. And see, that's why I didn't want to keep putting money into the vehicle. That's why I was just like, you know, let me call and see what my options is, just to trade this off so I can just have a peace of mind. Well, do you have the vehicle by you? They currently buy you by chance? Is it by me? Yeah. Like, do you have. Can you see the vehicle? Yeah. What I'm gonna have you do is can you send me the VIN number of that vehicle, the exact miles on it, and then a couple pictures of the outside and inside of it real fast? Okay. Okay, can you hold on one second? Am I sending it to an email or your phone? I'm gonna give you my personal [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, what's the okay? Okay, let me click and close on you. I'm good. I'm gonna go do that for you now. I'll call you right back. Okay. All right, sounds good. Again, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. So when you call back, just ask for me. Yes, ma' am. Okay, give me [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. And now to know information over to you. You said your VINT number. The front. Sorry, the outside and the inside of the car, and the exact miles on the car as well. Okay. And then from there, you'll be able to, what? Give me. Yeah, I'll be able to give you a better idea on what you're looking like. Okay. All right. All right, let me go take through this. I'll give you a call right back. Okay.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. If you know your party's extension, you may dial it at any time, at any time to speak with an [OCCUPATION] or for part. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Hello, this is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm interested in one of your AF 350 pickup and just call to get more, you know, detailed information about the car. Yeah, I can help you with that. Do you have the stock number and I can pull that up for you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I see there are two almost the same. So I can give you just one. Why, like yellow [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Okay, let me pull that one up real quick. Okay. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Okay. And what's the second one? The second one is the same as this one. So I just, you know, I think I just will ask one is okay for me. And first question is I want to know the payload of the chart, you know. Okay, one second. Let me see if I can pull up the window sticker real quick. Yes, let's see. The window sticker is showing it's currently unavailable. Let me see if it has a GVWR rating in here real quick for you. Give me one second. I'm gonna do a different search on the stock number, see if I can get the window sticker for you. So I can see the payload capacity on the windows sticker. It should have the GVWR rating on there. I'm gonna see if I also get an invoice pulled up the GVWR. I see it's 10,100 pound. So I have no idea if the GVWR is, you know, 10,000 pound. What's the payload of the chart? See, so the GVWR rating is the most weight allowed of both your trailer and cargo. So that would include like passengers and everything like that. So if it has like a 6000 GVWR rating, that means that is the max capacity, including passengers and what you're towing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, you know, I do not use it to a trailer. I just want to know how. How much pound or how many pounds the, you know, the trunk can load by itself. You know, it's usually the payload. I think if you have no idea, it should be on the. On the driver. Driver door. Yeah, there is a number on the driver door. You can see that, but I have no idea. No. Okay, let me see if there's a picture because I can't pull up the window sticker. Let's see if it's in the description. Let me see if I can do A quick search. Let's see. I can try and go track this down and verify that. I'm pretty sure the payload is going to be between like 7 and 8,000 pounds, depending on the vehicle. And this is a 6.2 liter. So let me change that real quick. Quick. So this one is it use diesel, not a gas ammo. Right, right. That's one. Yeah. So I'm trying to get the 6.2 liter. Okay. And I also see, Let me see. I don't think the window sticker has the payload capacity. Payload capacity is £4,290. £4,290. Oh, for base one only 4290 times. Okay. And I have another, you know, because I'm interesting. Can you help me to find out the other one? It's Y, like yellow, 25, 65. Okay. Have that one pulled up for you. Yeah. The most important question is about the payload capacity. All right, let me see. I have no idea where to find it. Let's see. So this one actually has a 14,000 pound payload package on it. So that's including the, I think the towing capacity. I just want to know the trunk itself, you know, payload capacity of this car. Okay. The Last one is 4290. How about this one? It. All right. It's a regular tab. This one looks like it's 4,000. Let's see. 4,134. Okay. Smaller than the previous one. Okay. Okay, got it. So another question is, I see the price for the. For the vehicle is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So any discounts or promotion that you'll still allow? Currently we don't have any [OCCUPATION] discounts on these specific vehicles. So it will be MSRP price. We don't do any markups or allocation fees. So it would just be the prices shown, plus tax, title and license. No any discount for the last year model either. Not on these specific ones. They're fleet vehicles. I'd have to see if they're still available, but those are sold at [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. Okay. Let me see if I have any other questions. [PERSON_NAME], just wait for a moment. So I see you also have some, you know, inventories that the rear wheel has a dual rear wheel. So that one will, you know, have much larger payload capacity. Or are you talking about like a single wheel versus like a dually? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I see Some, you know, F350 has dual double and four wheels on the rear part. So that one will have a larger payload capacity or. Yes, they'll have a lot more and then normally the ones that have their duallys are going to be the 6.7 liter diesel engines which will have a higher payload as well. So do you have any idea how much below the capacity of that one, the dual, you know, wheel one? I have no idea what you call this. Depends on year model and everything too. As far as if it has like a towing package and stuff. So there's a lot of different variables just so you know, usually to deliver good. Something like that. So the basic model is okay for us. We just want to have an idea. What are the difference payload capacity between the single wheel one and the double wheel one and which is our best choice. Let me do a quick. So we don't have any inventory I can do a quick reference on. I just did a search to see if we had that. You do not have dual wheel capacity, dual one in your store. I see. I, I, it seems, I see someone has the, Let me see. Yeah, I see one has a double wheel on the back, but I have no idea. I can tell you the stock number. It's a Z like Zoo 1650. Okay. That one is a 350. Let's see. All right, let me look at that one. All right, let's see. Maximum payload is £8,000. Oh wow. So maybe this is a better choice of us to choose. What did you call that one? [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] or I think it's [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Okay. I, I can I have your name and the contact number if I have, you know, to make appointments. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], last name [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Huh. And then it's this phone number and it'd be extended. Uh huh. Extension. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh huh. Thank you. Thank you for your help. Thank you. If you have any other questions, give me a call back and then I can, if I don't know the answers off the top of my head, I'll definitely get with management and get those answers for you. Okay. Okay.

I don't know what that means. It is loaded on the train and it was heading here. Every time I've checked it but now it has that strange message which I've never heard. I don't know what that means. I wonder if it is something to do with what she said, the tire. And it was. Yeah, it doesn't make a lot of sense. If, if the message you got last week saying it was loaded, it'll arrive in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] the [DATE]. And now this says this. Yeah, something [DATE]. It's really weird. It does say loaded, but I don't know what the message means. I've never heard that before. Right. Okay. So I don't know. I honestly don't know what to say. The only thing I can do is keep checking it and see if the message changes tomorrow. Okay. Okay, no problem. I just. That's really weird. So I've never in the history of my. Today actually is my 14th anniversary of working here. [DATE] [DATE]. In all the time I've worked here and taken orders, I've never heard that message before and I've never heard of them calling a customer to tell them that there's a problem with the tire. So it's really strange. I don't know how to reply to your question. Yeah, I know. I mean, again, this is just an ongoing almost [DURATION] [DURATION] thing now and nothing surprises me. So I guess we'll just keep waiting and seeing what's going on. Oh, I was going to ask you if we pay cash for the vehicle. How. What can. Can. I mean, can I give you a check? Can I do. What was that word? My Z. [OCCUPATION] check. No, [PERSON_NAME]. No, we don't. You don't do [PERSON_NAME]? No. So what would be the best. A [OCCUPATION] check. Okay. So as soon as it comes in and you can give me the total because I'm not going to add anything. I'm not going to add extended warranty. I'm just going to add it. Just going to take it as it is. The price minus the [MONEY_AMOUNT] and we put $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down when we place the order. I'm sure that shows somewhere on your. Of course it does. Yeah. So whatever. Excuse me. Yeah, there's no dispute on any of, any of that stuff. I have everything here, that is. And then the sales tax, would that be included in the. The [OCCUPATION] check? Yeah, I can, I can give you a total. Figure out the door. Okay, that's. That's what I would want. Do you want. Yeah, and we'll do that, we'll do that in advance, you know, once we figure out what's going on. With. With what's going on with that. I don't know. Then once we figure it. Figure this out, then I can get all that information for you so you can get the check ahead of time. Okay. And I would. Since we bank with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], that would probably be. My [MARITAL_STATUS] is out of town, so I'm handling all this. Now, normally she would figure out the money situation, but if it's a [OCCUPATION] check and the money is at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], that's what you would do? Go get the [OCCUPATION] check from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Absolutely. Okay. Yeah. If you write as a personal check, there's more hoops to jump through, but if you just get a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] check, it's a lot easier. Yeah. Okay. I. I can do that. That's. That's not a problem. Like you said, you can just give me the out outdoor price with everything and we'll. I have an estimate of what it is, but, you know, you can tell me once we get. I can get it down to the penny for you. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. And I. I hope I hear from you tomorrow. I'll keep my eyes on it. I'll call you tomorrow. Either way.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi, I was hoping to speak with [PERSON_NAME] and. Yeah, in [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, let me get in one second. Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hello? Hello, this is [ORGANIZATION]. Oh, hi. I was hoping to speak with [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, hold on one second. All right, thank you. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. The adwords from last night. Yeah. What's up, man? Not much. How are you doing? I'm doing well. What do we got going? I'm just calling for me and my mom. I was wondering if. Is there any way that we would be able to get the down payment down a little bit from where it was, the [MONEY_AMOUNT]? Yeah, that. It turns out it's going to be a little steep. That's going to stop us from being able to pay some other things that need to be. It'd be real tough to do that because if we. If we do that, then the deal structure goes out of whack and they're already kind of arguing with me about the approval as is with the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So taking it down to less would then put us into a tighter situation. Hello? Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't. I think we got disconnected for a minute there. I couldn't hear anything for a little while. Oh, I said that. So the call, the approval is with the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] down, and they're asking me for more. So I'm trying to get around it having to be more, but for it to go down more, like for the down payment to be less, the approval would probably diminish. I don't think we can get it done like that. Okay. Do you mind if I call my mom and call you right back? Yeah, go ahead. Here, shoot me a text. Do you have something that I write with or can you take down my number? Yes, I can. Let me know. Are you ready? [PHONE_NUMBER]. Yeah, yeah. It's my direct sell. You can get a hold of me there. That's the best way to reach me. Text me first just to make sure I'm not with anybody, and then I'll go ahead and call you right back. Okay, got you. Thank you very much. Talk to you soon, man.

"Thanks for calling, [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, I was looking to see if you guys had a [ORGANIZATION] custom in stock. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I know. Yeah, Give me [DURATION] second. Cool. You ready? Yes, sir. All Right, it is [VEHICLE_ID]. [VEHICLE_ID]. All right, let me pull that up. All right, let me set the tracker on that, see if it's on our lot. So I don't believe they put a tracker in it yet, but I am seeing that it's not in transit anymore. And let me check if there's any deals done on it. If not, then it should be on our lot and available for us. All right, then another question, because I was looking at the customs, but the LT is the [DURATION] that has the extra little compartment under the fold down seats, right? I wouldn't know 100%, honestly. Let me check. I'd have to go through the features real quick. Okay. Yeah, because they're usually like a little like, like little glove department kind of thing on the seats. And I had a LT and I was looking for that same thing. All right. Yeah. Let me check on the interior details. Rear C, Let me see. That's the wrong thing. All right, so it says for the back seat detail, it's a 60, 40 split. Folding rear bench seat. It can fold [DURATION] or both of the sides up. Yeah, I'm talking about the, the front seat. So you know how the middle seat folds down. So the front seat, you're saying. Yeah, the front seat. So if I'm sitting in the seat on the. On the bench, on the. On the front seat on the right hand side, there'd be a partner where I could lift up and open it. Okay, you're saying like the console in the middle. Yes. So the console in the middle should open. But if you lift the console up and make it like the seat, that bench opens up to another component. And I think the 2021s or the [DATE_INTERVAL] had. I want to know if they still do it. Let me see. If you give me [DURATION] second, I can call up my people in [ORGANIZATION] and I can see if they can let me know if anything. They could take over the call in, let you know anything else about the vehicle. They're on these. Okay. Is that. Is that vehicle on the lot right now? It's showing us available. I want to call them and make sure that they haven't sold it because it doesn't come through their deals on our system. So I'm just going to make sure for you. Okay. All right, Appreciate It. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, I just thought 220,000 miles of headphones. It's lowered. Is it automatic or manual? You see the [DURATION] in the versions? TR [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. The black [DURATION]. That car's lowered. No, the four door. That [DURATION] lower too. They're both lowered. No, you can tell they're lowered. I had an Integra. I know when they're lowered, she's going to have. Going to have to go sideways. You want a lower Civic? I said yes. When would be a good day? You have to go sideways. Is that [DURATION] or this [DURATION]? You can pull a picture of a stock Civic and look at that Civic of things lowered. There's a white [DURATION], the bill of sale and it's lowered. Hey, you there, sir? Yep. All right, so yeah, the only other deal that's being worked on, I just confirmed that it wasn't gone through. Nobody sold it or anything like that yet. So it is on our lot. And were you asking about the second compartment? Like there's an original glove box and you can press the button and it opens up another glove box below. I'm looking at it. It's in the seat. It's in the middle of the front seat. It should be a compartment that opens up. Yes, sir. Yep. It does have that. Yes, sir. The middle compartment. Yep. The double. Yep. And then what? Since it's [EVENT] [EVENT], what kind of financing does [ORGANIZATION] have right now for great credit? What's the lowest people are getting? The lowest? I wouldn't know exactly what it is. I know we normally range from around 4 to 7%, but I have seen it go lower. I've even seen somebody come in here and get as low as 1.5. That was a [DURATION] time thing, but it definitely was. It can get pretty low. As far as my [EVENT] [EVENT] and the financing, I don't know if there's any specials or anything like that. You definitely have to talk to [DURATION] of our people in [ORGANIZATION] for that. Not too knowledgeable on it, but can you transfer me to [DURATION] of them, please? Give me [DURATION] second. I might be able to ask them and get some info from them. Yeah, I'm kind of far away if it makes sense. If I can get a deal on it, I can drive. But if I'm going to be looking to get like 6% or 7%, it's not worth my time. Yeah. All right, let me see. If you don't mind, I'm going to ask you a few questions so I can create an account for you or just A profile so we can have this information down and we can write it all down there, keep it in [DURATION] place. All right, so I can't get a first and last name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. All right, and how do you spell last name? [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, cool. Oh, [PERSON_NAME], you got an email address that we could use for another form of communication? It is. Gotcha. Can I use your zip code? It's [LOCATION]. All right, and is this phone number your first contact? It is. Sounds good. All right, let me make that. Add the vehicle on. And where did you see this vehicle at? Was it on [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] website or just the [ORGANIZATION]? It was online. Yeah, the [ORGANIZATION] website. All right, cool. Sounds good. Marlon [PERSON_NAME]. All right, and would you be planning on. You said financing, correct? Yes. All right, and would you have a trade in? No. Okay. All right. And let me grab an incentive sheet. I'm gonna ask just a couple more questions to see if you qualify for discounts. College, military, all of it. All right, cool. So you're active military in college. All right, there you go. All right. And are you currently enrolled in college or are you recently graduated? Currently enrolled. All right, cool. And you're active military? Yes. All right, sounds good. All right, do you have a [ORGANIZATION] credit card? No. All right, all right. Do you own a [DATE_INTERVAL] or newer [ORGANIZATION]? No. All right, cool. All right.

Wrong answer. I don't believe it's for a trade in though. I forgot exactly what it's for. Yeah, I don't want to give that information. All right. Yeah, I know that. All right.

What are your hours like? So today we're open until [TIME]. I'm not sure that we would be able to get it here today, but I can check into that. Then we are [TIME] to [TIME]. Except for Saturday, which is [TIME] to [TIME]. Okay. I mean, I'm pretty. I work usually until [TIME], but I can come in during lunch or something. I get like a long lunch. Okay. Yeah, sure. So let me start off just by making sure this car is available. If it's available, then I'll give you a call back and let you know either way.

"Thanks for calling, [PERSON_NAME]. [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON_NAME], what can I get your price information on today? Yeah, actually, I bought a truck from you guys, and I'm looking at trading it in. The problem is that I don't have a build sheet on it, and you guys are the ones that originally built the truck. Is there any way I can get the original build sheet from the. The first owner from you guys? So let me get the understanding correctly. You're saying you're looking to trade the vehicle in, but not with us? Well, if you had a [ORGANIZATION] show truck, I'd come down and get it, but I'm looking for a show truck, you know, like a [ORGANIZATION] show truck. Oh, okay. Yeah, so that's why I'm trading it in. But for. For them to trade in my truck and give me the proper appraisal, they need a build sheet, you know, and you guys are the ones that initially built that truck. So I didn't know if there was a way. I get emailed over, like, the original bill sheet on it. What's your phone number, sir? Oh, yeah. Huh. Trust me. I wanted to trade in with you guys. You guys have a white one down there. White. Oh, what's up, [PERSON_NAME]? Okay. Oh, what's up, buddy? Is this you? Yeah. This, [PERSON_NAME]? Yeah, man. Yeah. I wanted that white truck, but it just didn't. Didn't fall into place at the time. Yeah. And I think. I think when you came. I think when you came in, I don't know if you came in or not, I got word that I was on vacation, so. Oh, yeah, that's what happened. You went on vacation. And I didn't want to deal with anybody else but you. And then I just kind of. I bounced it. I kind of forgot about it. Yeah. They ended up selling that truck. Oh, hold on. That's not the right one. So you want the bill sheet on this vehicle? Yeah, the one that I bought from you guys, because I guess the original guy that built the truck, you guys built the truck for him, you know, So I didn't know if there was a way I can get that. They got all the upfitting, all the up thing. Yeah. They want to know, like, the lift, the suspension, the tires, the rims, the exhaust, the intake, the. You know, everything that was put into that truck was that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] who did. Who did the uplift on it? Oh, [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I have to do some digging, and I would have to do some digging. Anyway, let me get with my [OCCUPATION] and find out who. Who is the Contact over there. Because what I have to do is call them, give the VIN number. Hopefully, hopefully they still got it in their database. This is a [DATE_INTERVAL]. So hopefully they still got their database of what they put on that vehicle as far as equipment wise. And hopefully they can give me a, out of my sheet of everything that's been added on that vehicle. Okay. Okay. Yeah, because. Yeah, because I can, you know, I can give you the bill sheet of what that factory build on there, but with you, if you're looking for all the stuff with the upgrades and stuff like that on it, I can't do anything on that, that end. On my side, I have to call the company from. We have to contact the company that did the upfitting on it because I surely don't, surely don't think we got the paperwork or anything like that on it. I know, but let me just, you guys have the original invoice on it or what he paid for the truck, because that might help too. Where that's like, wow, here's a, here's a regular RST for say [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And this guy said, you know, like [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I mean, obviously, you know, that's what I'm saying. It won't, it won't show none of that on there because it was just going to give you the standard for the rst. It's not going to give you any upfitting for, for what would you say? The name [ORGANIZATION]? Yeah. As far as who did up any. It's not going to show that on the, on the invoice. That's what I'm saying is it's not going to show none of that on my end. I have to call, contact them and they give me the accessory bill sheet for it or what they put on or added on to that vehicle. Okay, but let me do that. Give me a few. And by being after [TIME], it might be tomorrow before you hear. Tomorrow? Yeah, tomorrow, because they probably close or whoever we need to talk to. But let me find out the contact people that I need, the number that I need to contact for and then go from there. Okay, I appreciate it. Hey, no problem. Thank you, sir.

"Good afternoon. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Hey, [PERSON_NAME]. Are you a [OCCUPATION]? Yes, ma' am. This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I was in there on Friday, and I test drove one of your [ORGANIZATION] Grand Cherokees that you have at [DATE_INTERVAL]. But the. I can't remember what she said her name was, but she was the girl sitting up in kind of like the control center that does the. The money part of it was there. It wasn't [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. She never called me. Yes. Yeah, she never called me back or anything to discuss anything further. But you guys have been servicing my [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] for [DURATION], and I'd like to buy my new [ORGANIZATION] from you guys. I've got one that I can go get in [LOCATION], but I've been reading reviews and stuff, and it seems to be better to have to buy it from your home dealership. Some people are complaining about how things are going wrong with their [ORGANIZATION] Grand Cherokee to [DATE_INTERVAL] and [DATE_INTERVAL], and something about if you don't buy it from your home dealership, there could be a problem. So I know you don't have one on the lot, but I'm wondering if you guys could find one. What are you looking for? So I'm looking for either the [DATE_INTERVAL] or. I'm waiting. I'm willing to wait until [DATE_INTERVAL] or [DATE_INTERVAL] when the 24s come out. But here's what I'm looking for. It's the [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Grand Cherokee, two row. Yes, ma' am. Four wheel drive, white exterior, wicker beige interior. That's pretty. Sunroof Tech 2 package. I'm reading off this guy's proposal to me in [LOCATION]. So it's wl. Let's see here. You came in. When did you come in and test drive one? Because I don't see anything in here saying that you were here. What'd you say? You said you came in and test drove one. Yep. It was on Friday. I was with [PERSON_NAME], and I can't remember the guy's name, but. [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] guy. Very, very, very nice. He let me Drive the [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Grand Cherokee, but it just wasn't. I didn't like it. Was that the white one with the beige interior? Yeah, the wicker Bay. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's an older one. Yes, it did have. It did have the wick. It does have the wicker beige, but it. It looks like mine. It's not the new jean. Oh, you got UK's. Yeah, yeah. Not the New body style. Right. So this [OCCUPATION] wants to sell me a WL [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. That is the Grand Cherokee Limited 4x4. Bright white clear coat with the wicker beige interior. AJW is the Tech Group Luxury Tech Group 2. And let's see here. Oh, and the last thing that it has to have because I have a bike rack, is the trailer tower Prep Group B, because I need to add my. I've got. I added a tow hitch on mine. Mm. Okay. And he's Anyone's a charge [MONEY_AMOUNT] for destination fee. No, no, that's gonna be on all of them. Yeah, destination fee. Oh, I thought that was because he's getting it from somewhere else. No, that's on every single window sticker of any vehicle that you bought, not just our makes and models. It's everything. Yeah, it's not all of them. Okay, so that's what I'm looking for. Now, the only thing is, if Mousey looking at my inventory, and I'm sure if you had told [PERSON_NAME], I think you must have been working with [PERSON_NAME]. I don't know. Say his name again. Say his name. [PERSON_NAME]. Older. Kind of older. He had glasses. He was kind of short. Yeah, it's got to be him. Okay. Okay. He just never called me back. They were supposed to call me back. And if they had called me back, I would have told him, I've decided to go new, but nobody bothered to call me back. Okay, I do apologize for that. Not your fault, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. I'm looking through my inventory right now, and I don't see any. Let me just comb through. Yeah, I've been shopping [DURATION] [DURATION], and I keep getting the same thing. There's only 10 of the white with the wicker in the state of [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. They've all got to find them. [ORGANIZATION] doesn't want to do it because they don't find cars anymore and blah, blah, blah. And then I was in. Nobody wants to trade with [ORGANIZATION]. Nobody wants to trade with [ORGANIZATION] because they're just too aggressive on their pricing. I've heard that from everywhere. I've heard it from [PERSON_NAME]. I've heard it from [LOCATION]. I'm hearing it from you. I hear it all the time. But to their credit, when I was in the market for a [ORGANIZATION], I came to you guys first, and you wouldn't find me one. And. And they found it in [LOCATION], and that's [ORGANIZATION] I'm driving today. Huh? Okay. Yeah. [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yeah, I can make, like, an order here. [DATE_INTERVAL]. And see if we can find one. I can definitely find one. All right. So just. All right. So limited with the sunroof, the tech two package trailer, tow prep group white with the wicker beige interior. Yep. Doesn't sound too hard. It's that interiors what's getting you. And most of them, like the one I saw in [LOCATION] on Saturday, they have the [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] appearance package and I don't like that either. And I drove all the way to [LOCATION] and the girl said it had a sunroof. And as soon as I got into it, I was like, why is it so dark in here? Well, the top was [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] because it was a [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] appearance package and it had no sunroof. Yikes. So that was a waste of [DURATION] [DURATION] drive. Yeah. Now the only thing I'm finding. What did you like in the luxury tech group? Because that's not available right now. Why? It doesn't let me click it. If I were to order one, it doesn't let me click that option. So it might be on restriction, but that doesn't mean there's not one out there with it. So I'm just going to write it down on the paper form. Okay. The. The luxury tech group has the ventilated seats and it has the wireless charging pad. And I actually drove one out in [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. But it had stupid [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] appearance thing. It was [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] interior. Yeah. If I ordered one, it just wouldn't let me order. It doesn't mean there's not one out there, but yeah. Okay. Alrighty. And do you want my phone number? Is it the [PHONE_NUMBER]? Not the number you called me on. Yep. Okay, I'll shoot you a text. So you got my name and my number too. And I'll take this up there and see if we can find one. That'd be perfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate your help. Absolutely. All right, well, hang on. Let me make sure you get my. Let me make sure you get my text. Yo, this is [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. All right, I sent it. Hi, [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME] with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION].

Thank you and have a great day. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How may I direct your call? Hi, I was wanting to talk to someone about a warranty on a vehicle. All right, one moment, please. This [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I was wanting to get some information on a warranty on a vehicle. Okay. Do you have the VIN and the current mileage? I do. I do have the VIN number. Okay. And the mileage as well? Yes, I. Roughly. I don't. I know. It's. What the range it is in. Okay. Okay. Give me one second and I will. Sorry, I'm having some [MEDICAL_CONDITION] this morning. Yeah, no worries. Oh, hello. How long ago did you buy it? I'm just wondering if you're interested. It was bought in [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay. So it might not be in that. Which is fine. There's no issue with that. Give me the vin, please. So it is [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID]. Did you say [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]? Yes, ma' am. Okay, [VEHICLE_ID], [VEHICLE_ID]. And was that [VEHICLE_ID] or [VEHICLE_ID]? [VEHICLE_ID]. So I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] F150, is that right? Yes, ma' am. Okay. Okay, let's see here. And then the mileage is at, I think 72,500, if I'm not mistaken. So it's creeping up to hitting 73. Okay. And I did not get your name. My name is [PERSON_NAME], but it is under my dad's name. Under [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Spell the last name for me. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. And tell me your name one more time. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, ma' am. Okay, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, let me just go over here and see if I can. Okay. And so it looks like [DATE_OF_BIRTH] [DATE_OF_BIRTH] [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay. So let's go. Well, what was in that the other day? So we're going to put this in your dad's name. Yeah, it's under my dad's name. Okay. And that's [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], right? Yes, ma' am. Okay. Just want to make sure I spell it right. And what's a good address? I have to build, like, a mini profile to put him in the system. If it's under his name you could just bill it to their address. Their address. So it'll be [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. [LOCATION]. No, I'm sorry. [LOCATION]. Okay. And I can just put your phone number in here? Yeah, that's fine. And I have it at [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER]. Let's go. Put the vehicle [VEHICLE_ID]. Okay. Let's see what we can offer Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. So it looks like it's out of coverage right now. So we would have to do a 50 point inspection. And so basically, if once we call it [ORGANIZATION] and everything and you say, okay, they want to do it, we'll. I'll print up the document, they'll go over there, they'll do the 50 point. As long as it passes and they purchase the warranty, we cover that $[MONEY_AMOUNT] cost. Okay. Okay, let me see what we can do. You said about [MONEY_AMOUNT], 501 or something like that? Yeah, it's definitely. I know you said it was less than [PHONE_NUMBER], less than 73. And we'll, we'll get the exact mileage then. So we can still offer them a premium care. It's used, but it's still the same coverage as, like, it covers all over 1,000 components. It's the best coverage that [ORGANIZATION] has. Okay, so now can you tell me, are they looking. Is your dad looking at keeping it for like a longer period of time or is he more interested in the miles, or is it kind of a little bit of both? I'll go ahead and tell you that I can go out to [DURATION] [DURATION]. So you can do anywhere from [DURATION] to [DURATION] and we can kind of play with it and see what kind of like works. You know what I'm saying? But, but so let me. I'm just going to pick [DURATION] and then, which is [DURATION] [DURATION] and then 60,000 miles. The options for deductibles are 200, [MONEY_AMOUNT], and then there's a 50. Let me ask you this, [PERSON_NAME]. Did your dad purchase his S150 from [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, we purchased it there. Okay, perfect. So then that way he won't need the rental because he'll have loaners for owners. Right. So that saves [MONEY_AMOUNT] and so enhanced rental is [MONEY_AMOUNT], and then the first day rental is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So we'll take those options off. Did they tell you how they wanted to pay? Like, were they looking at financing options or. We have a [ORGANIZATION] Rewards Visa card that they would apply for and you get [PHONE_NUMBER] for [DURATION] [DURATION]. And then we also have like a Bud code, which is like a third party payment plan company. And they offer [PHONE_NUMBER] down. I'm sorry, they offer [PHONE_NUMBER] interest for [DURATION] [DURATION] with 10% down. And you can pay in installments, like a monthly payment. They send you like a bill or you can do where they automatically debit, like your checking or your debit card. Okay, so those are options. Is there a way that I could get all these options, like emailed to me in some sort of form so that I can talk about it with him? It's the only reason I really called was this me if it was still warning if there's like a warranty still because my steering wheel is locking up. So that's the only reason I was calling to see if it was still in the coverage warranty. It. The powertrain is good for [DURATION] [DURATION] and 60,000, but the bumper to bumper is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. So the steering is out. Okay. Yeah. So I mean, there's technically no coverage at this point based on the 72,000 miles. Okay. Get coverage. But there's nothing covered right now. No, that's fine. Okay. Is there a way, though, that I could still get all this information to see if they wanted to go ahead and renew? Oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I just need you to kind of tell me like what kind of different options you want because it'll just be in an email. So I really would like to. The one that you discussed where it was, I think you said [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah. That's [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah. And 60,000 miles. Yes, we'll go ahead and. Okay, I just want to see the packages that would cover up to like 150,000, I guess, miles. So then you're definitely looking at going the 60,000 miles. Yeah, because that'll give you 60,000 on top of the [MONEY_AMOUNT], which gets you as close to [MONEY_AMOUNT] as we could get you. Let me. So let me just tell you. Let me tell you this real quick. [DURATION] goes to [DURATION] and then. Okay, so [DURATION] [DURATION] will give you a [DURATION]. I'm sorry, [DURATION] [DURATION] will give you a 60,000 mile option. Okay. A [DURATION] [DURATION] will only give you a 48,000 mile option. So in order for you to get the longest, like you were saying you wanted to stay at the [DURATION], it's for you to get the 60,000 miles because if you go any longer, it's not available. Okay. Does that make sense? Yes. So I can quote you. I can quote you a 36 and a [DURATION], both with 60,000 miles. And I can put that in, in writing for you. What's your email address? [PERSON_NAME]. And then my last name? Yes, ma' am. Okay, well, if you'll just give me [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], like maybe [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah, yeah. No rush on it. Okay. I'll definitely get it to you today, and I might be able to go ahead and do it since I have it open. I just. My desk is kind of a mess right now, but I would definitely give it to you. And then. Are you thinking that he might. Your dad might want to finance it with the [PHONE_NUMBER] for [DURATION] [DURATION]? Are you thinking they might want to go the [PHONE_NUMBER] interest for [DURATION] [DURATION] with 10% down? I think that route for sure. I don't think. Yeah, the [ORGANIZATION]. Right. Okay. Okay. That's no issues. Okay. I will get this to you and then you'll have my direct email to call to, you know, respond back to me if you need to. Okay, awesome. Thank you so much for your help.

You just had a collision, and it should. Oh, yeah, because they have the tamper in some of those sensors on the bumper in order to get to where the rear view camera is. So he.

"Thank you for choosing [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I direct your call? I was just looking into selling my car possibly. I just don't know how it works with you guys, so I was just calling for more information on that. Yeah, of course. I can get you connected with a [OCCUPATION] and they can help you further. Okay, thank you. Thank you for calling our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION]. Albomos, [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Yeah, I was actually just looking. I was curious about selling my car. I just wasn't sure how that works with you guys or what your process is for that. So I was just calling for more info. Absolutely. The process is super easy, actually. All you need to do is bring down your car. We have one of our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] take a look at it. If you decide you like the number. It takes up to, I believe it's like [DURATION] [DURATION] to get the check, but it's normally faster than that. Okay. Depending on if there's like, a payoff on the car or not. Okay. So it takes just [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], really. So I got a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Patriot from a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] lot, and I loved it because it looked different than all the other ones because it had custom tires, it was lifted a little, had like a car rack or a top rack on it and everything. But it broke down not even [DURATION] [DURATION] later because the transmission. And I'm sure you know that that can be expensive. So I did look into getting it fixed, and then I was going to resell it, but then I ended up just getting a new car instead of putting the money into fixing it so I can park it and drive it. But that's about it because it's not shifting on its own anymore. And it definitely. There's some, like, transmission issue going on there, so I don't know what that's like for you guys, but I would be able to tow it, but I would not be able to drive it to you guys. So I don't know. But other than that, the car is in excellent condition, like interior and exterior. It's beautiful. So it's just the transmission, and I don't know anything about those except that it's CVT and that's synthetic, so that kind of. That kind of sucks. And I'm not really expecting a high number, But I paid $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for it outright, so it's been really hard to part with it. Right, no, that makes complete sense. Yeah. I mean, with it broken down, we're gonna. We're going to pay the price that is the broke down price. So that's right where it would be for us. And without looking at it, I wouldn't really be able to give you a number. And we don't have anyone that goes out and like looks at vehicles. Right. Okay. So I have no problem towing it there for you guys to look at it. [ORGANIZATION]. Sorry. Come here, baby. Hey, Mommy's on the phone. Give me a second. Come here. You're fine. So I'm waiting on [ORGANIZATION]. I have an appointment. I'm just going to drive there tomorrow, talk to them, send them videos and pictures of it and stuff, and then see what they offer. And then [ORGANIZATION], I think, offered me like [MONEY_AMOUNT], which is good because, I mean, it's broken down considering, you know, so. But I. Because I was gonna sell on the [ORGANIZATION] market for like [MONEY_AMOUNT] for a [OCCUPATION] special and let them know there's transmission issues because a dealership can like take that vehicle and fix it up and sell it for what I paid for it, you know, so. Right. Yeah, I just. I don't know what the process. So I guess. Yeah, I really don't know because it's gonna probably cost me $[MONEY_AMOUNT] to have it towed. Do you think that once it got there, if you saw for yourself, it was an excellent condition, but knowing its issues, Is there like a guesstimate you could give me, Especially since you know that it's broken down? Let me see if one of my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] is available to answer that. I don't have anything to do with appraising cars, so I definitely wouldn't want to speak on that. So let me get you down to somebody that that's what they do. And maybe that'll be a little bit more helpful. One moment. That'd be awesome. Thank you. Go anywhere in [DATE_INTERVAL] in a new [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Silverado. Comfortable yet commanding performance with the most functional bed of any available pickup. Now, with your good credit, drive select [ORGANIZATION] Silverado models for as low as 2.99 APR for up to [DURATION] [DURATION] or get cash allowances of up to $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Let's talk about your new Chevrolet when our call continues. Hello, this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi. So I was just. I'm trying to sell my jeep that I got from [ORGANIZATION] because it broke down on me. Unfortunately, it's in excellent condition other than the transmission having issues. And I don't know much about that. But I ended up getting a new car instead of putting money in to fix it. And I'M not expecting much for it. I bought it $[MONEY_AMOUNT] outright, like in cash. So it's been really hard for me to let it go because it looks so good and I want to fix it, but being told, like, there's something wrong with the transmission because it's not shifting and I could do it for a time manually. Manually. But now I can't even do that. So I can park it. That's about it. And it's got like, custom tires and a top rack and all that. And I got a offer from [ORGANIZATION] for like [MONEY_AMOUNT], which is nice, but I'm. And then. And then [ORGANIZATION] is going to see me tomorrow in [LOCATION] and I'm going to talk with them about it, like showing pictures and videos and stuff and see what they say. But I was curious what you guys would offer. And I have no problem towing it there so you can get a look at it for yourself and really decide what you guys are comfortable with. It's just I was hoping I could get a guesstimate if I was just up front with it having transmission issues and all that. Sure, yeah, we can. We can do that. Can I give you an email address and have you send a couple pictures and the miles. Yeah. To it? Okay. Yeah, absolutely. Give that to you. [TIME] [TIME]. Okay. [TIME], [TIME]. Oh, yeah, no worries. Okay, start over. What was it? Yeah, it's [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. Okay. So [TIME] and then it's all numbers come. Yes. All right. Okay, sounds good. I just sent you an email, so if you want to send that information over. Yeah, I will do that. Okay. Oh, in the email or do you. I can give you my number now. I don't have a good place to write it down right now, so if you can. If you can put your number in the email, then that would be best probably. Yeah, I can do that and give you an idea from there and then we will go from there. Okay, perfect. So I'll go ahead. So after I send in the things you need for in the email, should I just call back? Yeah, that'll be fine. What. What [DURATION] is it? So I know what to look for? Yeah, it's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Patriot. [DATE_INTERVAL] Patriot. Okay, sounds good. Yeah, send that over and then I'll try to give you a call, you know, within about [DURATION] [DURATION]. But if you don't hear from me, then, yeah, definitely give me a call back and ask for dawn and then we can kind of figure it out. Okay, thank you so much. All right, thank you. Bye. Bye. All right.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you today? Hey, [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], and I've been a few questions. I see that you have. There's three Challenger TAs that you have here, the 2023s. And two of them are actually. You have. You have two. Two of them are gray. And I was just wondering, are they the same color? Is one more of a silver and one of a gray? So the gray is going to be. Are you familiar with our granite crystal Challenger? Is that a gray color or is it more of a silver color? It's more of a charcoal gray. So I see that you have two 2023s. They have two of those, and they look like they're the same color. So they're. They're both the same paint code, right? I mean, are those the same paint coaters? One isn't. Don't they have, like, one that's a silver one kind of more, and then the other one's kind of a gray on the Challenger colors? Oh, yeah, there's a. They have a lot of colors. Give me one second. I'm just trying to pull this up for you. So that way I could. I want to make sure I'm looking at the. The right one. Yeah. On your slide here, they look almost identical. And I'm assuming they're the same color. I like that kind of more of a silver color than the gray color. And I'm just wondering if what I'm seeing in the picture, if it's accurate, is what it looks like. Can I get the stock number? I'm just trying to. I don't see it on our website. I do see it outside, though. I just want to make sure I'm looking at the right one. See this one here? I'll click on this one here and see what the start number is. Thank you. Let's see. I don't know where I'm going to find it. Here. This shows the VIN number. Oh, here it is. Stock number Papa Hotel 527287 is one of them. You said Papa [VEHICLE_ID]? Yeah. Okay. And it says that one's granite pearl coat. Okay. So what that is. That is. That is a charcoal gray. Okay. And I'm gonna click on the other one and stuff. It all meshes in real nice. Yeah. Let me look at this other one here. Let's see if it says the same thing. I should have done this earlier. Granite pearl coat. Yeah, they're both. The granite pearl coat it says on them. Yeah. And have you ever seen the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] version in person? I've seen one. I'm a prior. I had a [DATE_INTERVAL] Shaker RT. My. My favorite color is. And I know you guys had one is. It's the go Mango. And I know you had one for a while. It looks like you probably sold it. Yeah, that was. That was a pretty old hellcat that we had. Oh, was that. What was it a hellcat? Yeah. I don't remember being a hellcat. Do you. Let me ask you this. Do you guys get. Dude, are you gonna be getting any more of these? So the gray ones. So for the. So this is the last year [LOCATION] [LOCATION] Challengers and Chargers. I know. We're not even able to build them anymore. Everything that's coming in is what we're gonna have. Wow. Once inventory's out, it's out. I'm sorry. And then once inventory's out, it's out. Since they're discontinued, do you think you're gonna be getting any more, man? So it looks a grand total of about 14 more challengers. Oh, cool. I'm talking about the TA, so. No, not that. See, hold on. And I like. Yeah, we have a green one. We have a green one that's in transit. It's not here yet. And it is still available. Yeah, I see that one. [PERSON_NAME] here. You know, I'm kind of picky when it comes to colors. Yeah. Do you have any. And the other thing I'm asking is I do like the Shakers. I don't know if you. You have any of those come in. And I would have a narrow bodied one that's on the lot right now. What color is it? Give me one second. So it's a Sting Gray. Oh, Stan Gray. Yeah, it's the last Shaker that we have. Okay. Can you. Here's what I. I live way over in the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. I know you guys are there next to the airport. Yeah, I live all the way out in [LOCATION], all the way by [LOCATION]. So I have a. I drive. I make this commute every day. Oh, my gosh. All right, well, can you do me a favor and you can take down my name and if you get it, I used one in, you know, something with low value. I'm talking under [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Under maybe [MONEY_AMOUNT] at the most. If you get a TA or a shaker, would you let me know? Call me. Yeah. The TAs you want to see for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], though. Yeah, they've been around for a while. Yeah. Yeah, I know. That. Yeah, I'll see. Yeah. I'm. I tell you I'm a mopar guy from many, many years ago. So I pretty familiar with what, you know, what you guys have had out there when it comes to challengers. I will. My First Mopar was a 426 Sport Fury [DATE_INTERVAL]. And I've had Cudas and Chargers, [DATE_INTERVAL] Chargers and I've had all kinds of mopars and so I'm a die hard mopar guy. And what happened is I was in love with a car that I. The one I had I leased. The shaker that I had was [DATE_INTERVAL]. I leased it because I wasn't supposed to live long and I outlived the [OCCUPATION] what they were saying. And so I had. When I turned the lease back in I could, I wanted to buy the lease out but at the time I couldn't do that. And so now I'm ready to buy again. I want another Challenger. I do like the tas and the shakers and what color are you looking for what I wanted? Well like I said, I like the orange ones, the red ones, the silver ones. If you've got a silver one ta, those are really nice looking. I just not real sold. I guess I'd have to look at it. The green one that you have. It looks pretty cool. But the criteria that I'd want would have to first of all be a [MONEY_AMOUNT] and the other one would be. It'd have to be automatic and I really need that. I would really like to have the navigation system in them. So I'd have to. The deal breakers. That's how they, that's how they all come. They all come with the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You have some 392s, all right. I mean I know some Tas. A lot of them 392s, there's a lot of them for sale on the, on the web. I mean. Yeah, the two. Yeah, the [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] though. How much want to bet? Tell me you want to bet money? Yeah, it the most of our. I think Most of our 392s, you go, go look at them. Go look, pull them up and you, you can go on and look for Challenger TA392 and you're going to see a bunch of them pop up. And I think there's more of those for sale because I think people are unloading them because you know, because [LOCATION] [LOCATION] fuel economy thing they burn premium gas and they don't get as good fuel. The [MONEY_AMOUNT] Hemi is a very, very good Engine. And I'm not so certain how dependable over a long period of time that the 62 is. Well, yeah, the last time the TAs were out were in the. That [DATE_INTERVAL] range, and that's when they came in the [MONEY_AMOUNT], and those had the 6 4. But on the new [DATE_INTERVAL], they don't come with the 6 4. The versions. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I guess that's what I. Yeah. All right. So that they don't get them in [DATE_INTERVAL], they don't make the TA. I can understand. We had the TA discounted about $[MONEY_AMOUNT], too, from MSRP, the new ones. Is there a budget you're looking to be within? Yeah. What kind of budget am I looking in? Yeah, on a new one. On a new one, about $[MONEY_AMOUNT], plus tax, title and license. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I'm well aware of that. But I'm looking for the right one. I'm looking for. Yeah, absolutely. If we figured out numbers on one in person at the store, we'd be able to go to one of our sister stores and acquire one in the proper color. Okay. All right, that's good. That's good to know. As far as when I'm going to do this, it would be at least [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] where I could do this. What about driving one, one [LOCATION] [LOCATION] newer ones? Because they handle a lot of driving. They handle a lot different from about [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Yeah, absolutely. But, you know, like I said, I live over in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. I'm an old guy, and the drive over there, I could. I got so many things I got to do right now. My [MARITAL_STATUS] passed away last night, and so I got it. I've got all this financial stuff that I got to take care of. I've got all kinds of things that I got to do, and in [DURATION] [DURATION], I think I'm going to have most of what I need to do done. And I always wanted to get another one of these things, and I wasn't really able to afford it until now. And so. But like I said, it's going to be [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. But I want my really bad. I got. I got two vehicles to trade in for it. You know, that would help. But anyway, if you come up, if you get any more art, you know, I'd like another late model, something that's got like 20 or less miles on it maybe, you know, I would. I'd want to be interested possibly in that. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Is the number that you called On a text. Texting number. Yeah, I just got your text. Okay. I just wanted to make sure if you respond yes to that, anything I take in that I think you might like, I could send you pictures of. Oh, cool. Yeah, do that. Or I have to respond so it's a little bit easier. I could. I could. I. I could show you what the gray PA Looks like that I have outside here, along with that. That shaker that we have, too. Yeah, I. I know what they. You know, I know what they look like. I. I just don't want to go out there all the way over there unless I. There's something that I'm really interested in. But I'll stay in touch with you. I mean, if you do, you can go ahead and text me pictures of something that you can find, and I could send. It would be [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] before I could do anything. Yeah, that's perfect. All right. I'll also see if we have any. Any others coming in that fit the colors that you're looking at, just in case you wanted to reserve one and whatnot. But you can send me pictures of them, whatever color they are. There's some colors that I like, and there's some that I don't. I've never was a gray fan. Now, the white ones, I don't like white cars, but the white ta is the contrast, and it looks really good, and I like those. But, yeah, it just has to be. It just has to trip my children when I look at it. That's all, you know, so this is my last hurrah, and. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Okay. So anyway, you got my number. My name is [PERSON_NAME], and. Oh, yeah, keep me in my seat. If you see if something pops up, you know, just let me know. Oh, yeah, absolutely. The. And if you. And then once you respond yes to that, I.

And I need to see what the warranty is on it or who we need to take it to. You can take it anywhere. You take it anywhere in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] or any certified shop. I would just take it to the nearest [OCCUPATION] shop in your area. I know like the manufacturer. [OCCUPATION] like [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], they're all pretty backed up. So I'm in [LOCATION]. I would, I take it to like [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. Because I called the [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] dealership in surprise and she said that we don't have a warranty.

Because last time I called [ORGANIZATION] they said it was going to take [DURATION] [DURATION] for them to just. What they do is they park it in the back. Right. [ORGANIZATION], been there for [DURATION] [DURATION] trying to get a transmission in it. Right. So I work right across the street from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. My house is three blocks away from a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], so I just take it to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Their hourly rates are better. They don't try and charge more than what they should pay. Okay. Or what they should charge, you know. So do you know? Because we think it's the. The front axle is leaking. Is that covered under that? Yeah, that should be covered. Okay. They have a comprehensive coverage, so. Okay. So I can just call [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and tell them. Yeah. And then I'm going to email you your documents so that you have. You don't necessarily need it because they're just going to look it up by VIN number. Okay. And then call [ORGANIZATION]. But you can just tell them you have a [ORGANIZATION] warranty. [ORGANIZATION]? Yep. Okay. All right. Thank you. My pleasure. I'll send it over. You'll have it in the next [DURATION] [DURATION].

We're glad you did. Hi, [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME] speaking, how can I help you? Hey [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. How are you? I'm good, how are you doing? [PERSON_NAME], I am in a bit of a pinch and I'm hoping you can help me out. All right, I can try. All right. I looked at your website and it looks like you have a Sonic Gray, Sonic, whatever that color is called, [ORGANIZATION] Pilot Trail Sport. And it also looks like you have a [ORGANIZATION] Elite. [ORGANIZATION] Pilot Elite in obsidian blue, is that correct? So the trails board is here, but that's actually a sold on order. [PERSON_NAME] and I do have an Elite but it's in silver with gray interior. But I will have some Elites in obsidian blue that will be here in the next [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. That's where we're at in impasse. So my [MARITAL_STATUS] is on vacation. She happens to be down in the greater [LOCATION] [LOCATION] footprint and she has wanted one of those two for about [DURATION] [DURATION] now and forever. We cannot find them. So. Shoot. Well, you're just in luck. I guess I'm still. Well, do you live here in [LOCATION], around the [LOCATION] area? No, we are way up in [LOCATION]. Oh, wow. So would you be flying down here and then driving up? No, she took off on vacation and she happens to be there right now. And I was looking at your website and I happen to notice y' all have them listed on your website, but it sounds like you don't actually have them. Right. So like I said, I do have the Obsidian Blue. That'll be here in about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. If that timeframe works for you all, let me know since I know you guys do live out of state. Yeah, unfortunately, as much as my [MARITAL_STATUS] likes to believe it, we ain't rich. So she ain't gonna stay down there that long, so. Yeah, well, let me know if you wanna. If you wanna talk to her and see about you guys maybe coming back, but. Or maybe coming down here. What's your. What's a good contact number for you, [PERSON_NAME]? I'll give it. Okay, what's your last name? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Well, did you want to get in contact with her and talk it out? But the trosports, those are pretty hard to come across. Most dealerships, that's one of the most high demand [OCCUPATION] that we typically get with there being a time frame. If you guys are open to waiting, if you want to talk to her. But if she was open to the Obsidian Blue elite, as I mentioned, I have one that will be here in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. And what we could do is that after you talk to her, I can send you over pricing. And if that's something you guys wanted to reserve, it would be a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] refundable deposit. So once the car gets here, you could use that [MONEY_AMOUNT] towards the total purchase of the vehicle if you pay cash or towards a form of down payment, or if at the last minute, for some reason things don't work out, we can refund you the money back. She's actually already done that. She's just very impatient, so. Oh, gosh. She has one reserve here in [LOCATION] that she'll have by the end of. The problem is she does not wish to wait till the end of the [DURATION]. Oh, well, you're so sweet to look at other places while she's here. Don't mistake. I'm just scared of her. Yeah, you should.

[PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I don't remember. We were talking really quick. I wrote it down. It's at my office. But he said, I promise you someone will call you tomorrow. Sorry for the delay. I don't know if it was [PERSON_NAME] or [PERSON_NAME], but what I was trying to say was he didn't mention it was definitely at the property. He mentioned it's in the system, that no one's gonna. No one could put a deposit on it or see it. It's got your name on it. My. But this guy will call you tomorrow. And he said it's at [ORGANIZATION], so I assume it's there, but I don't know. Okay.

"Morning. Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. My name is [PERSON_NAME], how may I assist you? Hi [PERSON_NAME], I'm [PERSON_NAME] and actually I'm looking to buy a car [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON_NAME] sv. So I was just going through a website and I saw that and I just wanted to some more information on that. Yeah, of course. On a new [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON_NAME] SV or used [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON_NAME] sv. New. New. Oh yeah, of course. Is it. You said the SV correct? Yeah, yes. Okay, yeah, no problem. What questions do you have? So basically I mean I've already been tested on other showroom so I know car is good, I want to buy it but just I want to know like what offers you are giving, what's the price? I. I can expect out again out of gate price and isn't like. So I just going through the website and I it's mentioned that you are giving a financing of a [MONEY_AMOUNT] for that [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's like it's again it's based on my credit score. It's like what you guys are giving the [MONEY_AMOUNT] that you saw is our special financing. Now in terms of Decentra right now we don't have any lot but we do have some coming in. If you want you can come in and check out Accentra. We actually have used ones but just to get a feel for Decentra in terms of what to expect in pricing we do include our dual added accessories which is a way to protect your assets. A way for us to build value on the vehicle that is all weather floor. MA Tactac is paint protection which covers your car from oxidation or chipping in terms of paint. Also included in that is tinted windows as well as wheel locks and nitrogen filled tires. Okay, so what out of gate size I'm expecting here? Well right now I wouldn't be able to inform you on that. Why? Because like I said we don't have any new [ORGANIZATION] Sentras in our light right now. But like I said we do have used ones. So you can definitely stop by and check out a used one and then we can talk about pricing on a new one. Like I said they're not here yet but around I wouldn't be able to give you an estimate. We do also have doer added, there are dealership fees which include your tax title, everything like that. The only thing you need to worry about is really just checking your mail for that tag. So is it possible to give me a call whenever you have new inventory available? I want to buy new one only, not the old one. Okay. Okay. And you're looking for the SV only, correct? SV only? Yes, because S I think so. Okay, so sorry, I'll take this little bit more time. So what I've seen in the lower model of SV S. So what are, what's the feature? Not available. What I know that we don't get heated seats. There's no [ORGANIZATION] what to say Android Auto leather seats? No, the S model does have Android auto and [ORGANIZATION] CarPlay. It just doesn't have heated seats. So what's the difference between S and S? V? The major difference is. So the S is a smaller screen. I believe it's a 5 inch display, whereas for the SV it's a 7 inch display. Now not just that, you also have a power seat in your driver's side as well as rims on the tires instead of the rim caps on the regular S. Okay. Okay. And the higher model of centralized, that's sr. Right. So what's the difference between SE and sr? SR is more of a premium luxury. So that one is going to come with your heated seats. It's going to come with instead of 16 inch tires, it's going to have 17 inch tires, different rims and it's also going to have a fog lights. Okay. Okay. So I think I'll stick with SB only. I think I don't want luxury, but I don't want. You said you're looking for heated seats. I mean SB has heated seats, right? No, yeah, sv, SV base doesn't have heated seat. Okay. I mean that's again long term mandatory thing what I did. So what I need, mainly need is safety features. So what I've seen like [ORGANIZATION], all of the model has all the safety features, right? Standard, yes. All sensors have the same safety features. They're gonna have your front and back sensors. It's gonna have your blind spot indicator. This doesn't have to be a lane departure. Okay, so sorry, go ahead, continue. No, you can go ahead. I'm think that yeah, I'm going to ST with SV only. I want SV new one only because I think old one, I don't want to drive any which already driven, I don't know, maybe like 6,008, 6 to 80,000 miles. I want to get a new one only. So if you have inventory available anytime soon, can you just give me a call? I'm interested in that. So I'm looking forward to this. And also if possible, white color. You said you're looking for a white one. Correct. Is there any other colors you would be interested in or does Color not really matter, it's just you prefer a white, I prefer white. I don't want black color basically and I don't want black. So if you have white available or maybe any other color is fine other than black. Okay. No black. Okay. Okay. Correct. Yeah, that's correct. Okay. And your name is. Chose it. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And last name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Okay. I'll check what we have. And like I said, right now we're having new sentences. We do have used one, so if you ever want to stop by, check out a used one. We do have used svs and just to get an idea, not that you're going to purchase it, just to get an idea of how the SV looks already I went to a different showroom, I've taken a test so I like that sb. So I will come only when it's available because I don't want to take up your time and take up my time. So. Of course, of course. Now before you hang up, once again, I know you said new and I apologize, I know you said new, but we do have a used central. It is why it is SV. But it has 6,000 miles only. It's very low in mileage. So not just that, something that we, that I think would be beneficial to you in terms it's a [DATE_INTERVAL], so it's only [DURATION] [DURATION] difference. The difference, it really doesn't make any difference in terms of features. It has the same features. Both of them have the exact same features. This is the one thing you're going to have that's better on the one is a longer warranty. So it's applicable to be certified, pre owned and you can once you get it certified and that goes a warranty up to 100,000 miles. Well, if you buy it new, your warranty will only go up to 60,000. Okay, so what's the price difference I'm seeing from new one and old one? Well, price difference like I said is about [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. But like I said, the vehicle only has 6,000 miles on it. That's it. I think I can see on the left side, I've opened it, it's white. On the right it is white. Like I said, it's practically new and you can get it certified. Okay, I think I'm going to just reset on this one. I think I like this option. It's only 6,000 miles, so that's good. I'm going to research on this one and maybe I'll give you a call Tomorrow or maybe today. What time you're available tomorrow? I'm here till [TIME], [TIME]. Till [TIME]. But in fact, I just want to add one more thing. It is [EVENT] [EVENT], so we are having [EVENT] [EVENT] specials. So right now would be a great time for you to come in. If you're available. We could probably get you beyond that. [PERSON_NAME], I don't have a car. I cannot come. So that's why I need to wait for my friend. It will not be possible to come today. But so what offer? Like I can see. Maybe I can do something. So what offer you're giving on on that central? I wouldn't be too sure about that. Like I said, I don't make pricing. That's my management. So once you step through the door, we're able to talk about pricing in turn. But I can tell you it'll be way cheaper than the new Centra. It'll be cheaper than the new Centra, and you get a longer warranty on that. And the difference is only 6, 000 miles. So I would recommend getting that [DATE_INTERVAL] instead of the [DATE_INTERVAL].

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON_NAME] speaking. How can I help you? Hey, yeah, I was just calling. I bought a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Wake Pro there, and I was thinking about possibly getting rid of it and maybe getting, like, a road bike, just because I haven't been able to get out in the water a whole lot and it might make it easier. And I wasn't sure how that would work because I bought, like, that [DURATION] [DURATION] extended warranty on it when I want to get the money back, like, from that on a prorated basis when I shifted everything around. Okay, you have a street bike, you want to [ORGANIZATION] it in for watercraft and you want to know if you're watercraft. Yeah, I have a watercraft and. Oh, and [ORGANIZATION] in. Okay. Yeah. Yep. And you want to know if you could transfer your warranty. I think I would have to get the money back, like, on a prorated basis. I wasn't sure how that works. Yep. I would say contact the warranty company and they'll tell you what they can do or whatever their terms are, you know? What warranty company do you guys use? We have a bunch of them. Did you have, like, a paperwork on it? Like what a company says? I can't. I can't find my paperwork. But I did buy it from you guys? Yeah, Yeah, I kind of need that information. Do you know who your [OCCUPATION] was? No, no, but I did buy it from you guys. I don't know if you can just look it up in my file. Well, let me try. With [ORGANIZATION], I would try this phone number. Let me punch in and see what anything comes up. Okay, well, yours popped up and it says [OCCUPATION] unknown. Let me see what I can find on here. That guy. The guy that just did. He just was. His last day was yesterday. Okay. I don't know. It's a different number here. Okay. And you were interested in also trading that bike in for Wake Pro? Trading my Wake Pro in for a bike, yeah. But I just need to figure out about getting the money back for my extension. Extended warranty. Okay. And you can't. It's not with your other paperwork and everything. What company did that? You had your warranty through? I don't have any of my [ORGANIZATION] paperwork that I was calling you guys because I bought it there. Yeah, usually they give you that white folder that has just everything in it, you know? And you don't have anything. Yeah, no, no, I don't. I don't have it. I'm not even at that house right now. All right, I'm gonna have to try to research this, see what I can find and track back with our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. See what. Which one they used and. But when were you thinking about. I was thinking about driving over next weekend to kind of see. But I need to look at your inventory online for the bike. So it kind of depends on what you got there. We're looking at some of like the Triumph and stuff, but. Yeah, trying to figure out the extended warranty thing first. Okay, well, I'll have to find out about that. That's not going to be an easy task. But give me [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] or. Because we get really busy on Saturday, but let me see what I can do and I'll get back to you. Okay. Thank you.

Let me get your file pulled up in front of me. I apologize. Making a bunch of calls this morning. So. All right. So, yeah, it looks like you had called in in regards to an Explorer and I was just calling the bank shares, like [PERSON_NAME] had reached out to you. He's one of my [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] here. I didn't know if you got any information that you needed or to see if there's anything further I could do to assist. Well, it's interesting. I was there. I looked at one, talked to a [OCCUPATION]. I don't know who it was. I got an email back from a [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] for Internet [ORGANIZATION]. You know who he is? [PERSON_NAME]? No, I don't have a [PERSON_NAME] here. Was it from the same dealership? I don't know. I thought so. Anyway, it was just not a horrible email, but I was there and I looked at one and then somebody's going to get back to me with prices and. And now I got a call from you. So it's really a catch 22. I don't think one person's talking to the other there, that makes any sense. And it was. It was [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] that you visited. Oh, no, I was where I was. I was in [LOCATION]. That's. Oh, okay. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, that's. Word is right. That was. I was going to say, I was like, I don't have any notes in here that you were here. Yeah. What happens is if you had. It looks like I don't have the exact [DURATION]. I apologize. I can look it up. But it looks like you had called in. Okay. It looks like you had called in on the [DATE] and spoke with [PERSON_NAME]. He's one of my [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION]. But I just, you know, there was no notes as far as what you were looking for, anything like that. Well, here's the skinny. Here's exactly what I want. I'm going to tell you what I want, and then you can look fast inventory and see if there's something that is available. And then, of course, it's always. And about financing, I see that. [EVENT] [EVENT], you guys get zero finance for [DURATION] [DURATION] and 3% or [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [DURATION] [DURATION]. I'm not sure if that's still standing or not. That is correct, yes. Okay, so let me tell you what I want okay I want an Explorer you know with basic options but you know I mean I've had many Explorers and [ORGANIZATION] guy. I have a [ORGANIZATION] now for what it's worth. Okay. But I need, I need a 4x4 explorer. I have a front wheel drive [ORGANIZATION] Grand Cherokee now that I need to trade to for the possible [ORGANIZATION]. I've already got a guesstimate of Jeeps on what they'll do but I really am an Explorer guy so okay explore basically with the basic stuff. Usually the X got one I had was an xlt. Red seats were power seats and the windows went up and down and I'm in my [PERSON_AGE] so we're not that complicated but you know the basic cool stuff kind of. Yeah. I don't need to have a. I don't know or the [ORGANIZATION] camera member but everybody's got about three or four different scales of a particular item. Like [ORGANIZATION] Explorers got I think xl, XLP limit nuts, G battle, you know what I'm saying right. I don't need the amount of basically I need a good package but I need a 4x4 and I need a trailer hitch and I think I already looked it up that Explorer will pull up to a 6200 pound package. I have a 4700 pound boat that's in [LOCATION] and I need to take in and out of lakes up there. So anyhoot that's what I'm looking for guy color wise really not a black, red, blue guy at all. Definitely not blue or red but I would go with white, gray or silver and then black. Third I've always had you know leather seats. I like leather seats and [ORGANIZATION] I've been looking at doesn't it leather seats but I'm still going to have to cover the damn things because I had a dog. So I don't know there what the cost are on that. So why don't you. Unless you already know what your inventory is. Why don't you check that inventory and let me know what I'm looking for and if there's anything that's worth looking at and then approximate price because it still has to be within a reason if that makes any sense. Sure. No absolutely, I get that. Yeah let me go do this. I'll go touch what I've got available. My website is hit or miss because we get inventory moving daily. So yeah I'll touch what I've got and see if I can find something that meets the parameters you're looking for and and then I can even send you a photo of it if you want to take a peek at it. And then I'll send you over pricing as well. So you know exactly where that sits. Yeah. If there's something that's reasonable, I'll drive there. We're in [LOCATION], so I'll drive there and take a look at if there's something that meets our needs. Sure. Okay. Okay. Yep, you got it. Give me just a few do Best number to reach you. It is. Okay, you got it, sir. Give me a few. Let me see what I can find, and I'll reach out to you here shortly. Cool. Thanks, guys.

Okay, it looks like it was a [OCCUPATION]. He was probably just going to ask if you were still interested in the [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Titan. Where are you guys located? We are [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. We're on [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Oh, yeah, yeah, put me through. Okay, let me. Let me ask him. Okay.

Hey, did you look at all the inventory that was sent over? Yeah, I think it was the [DATE_INTERVAL] you sent. No, there was an [DATE_INTERVAL] out there. I pray to God we didn't sell it because I saw that somebody was showing it on Saturday or. No, yesterday, because I came in yesterday on my day off because of you, and it's okay, because they ended up being with another customer, being within [DURATION] [DURATION] and selling them a truck. It was a white Titan, as a matter of fact, but it was brand new. That's the thing. The older people, all the [OCCUPATION], they have the money to buy new cars, you know. You and I are not buying new cars. Yeah, they depreciate too fast. But he literally said, hey, I'm just trying to spend my money before I die. That's what he told me. So what's that, brother? Give me his number. I can help him. I got some investment properties. Oh, come on. Now, I know you're from [LOCATION], you know, with that line. All right, so, dude, are you gonna. Are you interested? You're not interested? I'll stop calling you if you're not interested. No, it's not that. It's. I'm just trying to crunch the numbers before I come in. Dude, I think we sold it. Shit. Now, I have another one out there. I've got a silver one, but it's two wheel drive. It's two wheel drive. It's got 40,000 miles. 19. How bad do you need four wheel drive? I use it every week, man, because with my business, I'm always part of parking, like in backyards or. How much do you tow? It's not so much towing as it is using it. Getting in and out of ditches, like places. So I have the screen company, and to get to the back of the cages, sometimes I got to drive back there so that we're not the ladders and the material. Well, so now I look. Looks like this one's rear wheel drive, so that's not going to work. It looks like. I need to find you another one. It looks like that white one was 78,000 miles sold yesterday. Because I knew that was a nice truck. That was right in your price point. It was four wheel drive because remember, the guy from [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], ghosted me. Yeah, we. I thought we decided that one was going to be too expensive. No, that was right there. That was right about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So even with your money down and with your trade, you would have. That would have covered up the fees and some of the taxes. You would have been right there. It was the gray one. No, it was a white one that we had. I'm all, dude, I'm almost positive it sold. I'm almost positive. So I thought, see, that's what we messed up. What you tested me was a gray one. It's the white one. I wanted that. I've never. I've never taken any pictures of the gray one. The white one. I sent you for my personal cell phone, which is what I just sent you. And here's the thing. Can you do a Frontier, or is that too small with you and your guys in it? Come on, bro. I'm a man's man. Like me, I wanna. The next purchase. I wanted to be like, I want to love it. I want to love. I want the leather package. Well, I mean, it's a [ORGANIZATION] x Frontier with 3,000 miles on. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. But I just took it in on trade yesterday, like the little brother of what I have now, and I'm trying to upgrade. No problem. All right, so what I have to do is go. At least you answer. Your conversations are fun. I know where you're from. I'm from the same place in the world. But unfortunately, unless I put you into, like, maybe. Would you do a Silverado Z71? Well, shoot, today we sold that one, too. Dude, we've sold 40 cars in the last [DURATION] [DURATION]. I don't know where you've. You've been kind of late to the party here. Unfortunately, to me, going to see you guys is painful. And I'm a really busy guy, and I'm already having fucking problems with my girl because I don't spend enough time with her. So any free time is really time that I have to go with you guys. But I don't really want to go unless we crunch the numbers, run, like, first find what I'm looking for. Yeah, they don't. They don't let us run numbers and give Them to you over the phone. I mean, it's just as simple as that, [PERSON_NAME]. You have to understand that. But I now. I don't have anything for you. Crap. I want to come in when we got something that. To look at. I mean, just to waste your time. I mean, can we. Well, I'm gonna. You know what? I'm gonna call you back when I get another one in. Because truthfully, look, this is me not wasting your time. It's just me catching up with a friend. And that is. I don't see anything in there now that's going to qualify for what you're looking for. And that's because over the weekend I think we sold it, dude. So I will call you back and enjoy the rest of your day for sure. What's your phone number? What's your text or one? It's. We live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Zero was me texting you and you ghosted me. You never texted me back. All right, I'm going to send you my financials just so you have them and then that way we can go ahead. Yeah, don't do that. Don't. Don't send it to my personal text. No, just hold on to them. I trust you. You just have to learn some trust for me. When I tell you that I got something, I think it's going to work for you. That means you make a little bit of time and then we get a little bit closer. Then you go. Yep, I'll take it. You know what I mean? Because I know we need to get you out of 27%. 27% sucks. That is state max in the state of [LOCATION] for a used car. That means your credit at the time was terrible. Yeah, everything's paid off. I got $[MONEY_AMOUNT] collection. That's it. And I'm perfect. Now it's time for me to help you with it. You know what I have out there? Oh, shoot. You might like that. I've got a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Super Duty [ORGANIZATION] one ton, but it might be a little bit out of your range. It's four wheel drive. Yeah, but upper 30s there. That's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. I have one out there that's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. This. This is the one. But this is. This is probably a little out of your price range. It's a one ton [ORGANIZATION] diesel. But if you go to. If you got a 704 credit score, you could probably get. Get that truck hung and bought because it books out so strong. Those trucks, you know what they worked like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. During. After. Right after [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. Dude, they were like [MONEY_AMOUNT] for those trucks. So if you're okay with diesel, four wheel drive. Let me. Let me try to find something else. Everything else, even used. Used rams are [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's crazy. That's the truck market. Send me the [ORGANIZATION]. Well, this one doesn't have any pictures on it yet. This one doesn't have any pictures on it. But that one might work for you. What color? It's like a grayish color. Are you ever down [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? Yeah. Where's most of your clients? [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. They're mostly in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. All right. Someday when you're down here, you just, you know, before or after your lunch. Just don't do it on a Thursday. That's normally my day off. Just come in and ask for [PERSON_NAME]. I'm the only [PERSON_NAME] in the whole building. How long you. How late are you gonna stay there for? I'm gonna stay here till [TIME]. But I don't. As I said, I don't have anything for you. I'm not sure that that's gonna work unless you're ready today. You said 1 ton? 1 ton [ORGANIZATION]. 1 ton [ORGANIZATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] with 73,000 miles diesel. It looks like that. The little guy that had the thing never used it. It's 11 years old, but it's a one ton diesel that will pull about £26,000. And if you put a fifth wheel in it. I'm from the farmland. I'm from [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. All my buddies from high school have farms. They're all 2,000 acres apiece. My grandfather wasn't a [OCCUPATION], [PERSON_NAME], or I'd be living up there and I'd be very wealthy. But I'm neither. I'm living here. So I know the truck market. If you put a fifth wheel in that thing, you can pull about [MONEY_AMOUNT] with that thing. But it's a big. It's a big bad boy, let me tell you. What's that? What am I going to do? Get into the towing business? I don't need all that. No, I'm just talking about if you're needing something to really tow. But my Frontier idea, which was. Is like brand new in a box with 3,000 miles on it. Just because he drove it. Just because. But he couldn't tow his 11,000 pound boat. That's why he bought a truck yesterday from me. Yeah. I'm just telling you I don't like the Frontier. It's too small. Yeah, it's too small. I'm [PERSON_AGE], so it'd be for me in about [DURATION] [DURATION] when I want to retire and just kind of just mill around [LOCATION] [LOCATION] throwing mulch and flowers in the back of it. You know, that's what it'd be for. I get it. I understand. But you're still working. All right, So I will call you when I've got some. Or when you. When you stop by, just ask for [PERSON_NAME]. Okay? Can't wait to meet you sometime. You. Did you get my text? Hold on. Yeah, because I saved you in there as [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Hold on. [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, I say I see your name there. I have no text from that number. Well, then it went from. Went somewhere else. But it doesn't matter because the ones that I texted you, the truck already sold. So when I have some. Have something better. I will text it to you now. Okay. All right. All right. You got it. Later on. Have a good day. Bye.

"Thank you so much for choosing [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Will you come to schedule a reservation during our [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] today? I want to get some information if you guys have any Tacoma four cylinder. I actually do have several Tacomas here on the lot right now, sir. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Are you here local to the [LOCATION] area by chance, [PERSON_NAME]? I live in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. Yeah, you're right down the road. Are you able to swing by right now to kind of go over what we have here on the stock on the floor? No. Can you check and see if you have a four cylinder? Okay, give me one second. What was it about the four cylinder that you liked less? Less gas consuming vehicle. Okay, totally get that. Yeah. Let's see here. I. I own a route for 20, 21, so it's. That's good on gas mileage, but I need a truck. Okay, I totally understand that. So we're thinking about trading in the raft. Yes, sir. Cool, man. I'm definitely interested in that. Did you buy your RAV4 from us by chance? Yes, sir. Cool. Second here, I have quite a few of them here. I just need to verify if they're 4v6. Let's see here. Okay. Looks like I have the ones I have on the ground physically here. Excuse me. Are going to be the V6s, but I do have a couple of four cylinders that are on the way. Would you let me know whenever I get there? Yes, sir, I could definitely do that or what I could do. I have. I do have some that are coming in. I could possibly reserve one of those ones that are coming in for you. And let me just check one second. One thing for you as well. While I got you on the phone, Mr. [PERSON_NAME], he's looking for like pretty much the better gas mileage. Just trying to see what the difference in the. In the gas mileage is. I don't think it's a huge difference. You know, just to be completely honest, it's got to be four cylinder. Okay, so. So on the Tacoma, the four cylinder, it gets 23 miles per gallon. Right. So on the V6 Tacoma, you're getting 21. So literally it's two miles per gallon difference. Yeah. And you're getting a truck with a little bit more power and just in case you need to tow things or. And all of that. So, I mean, what about the pricing though, the pricing of the vehicle? Let's see here. We actually have it on [EVENT] [EVENT] sale, right now, so we're being very aggressive on pricing. Let's see here. Take the difference on the pricing is literally a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay? I mean, like I said, I have about [TIME], four. I got silver, I got white, I got gray. I got. I got a window seat. So I'm looking at them all from my window. I got silver, white, gray. Right now here, silver, white and gray. Yes, sir, the gray. The gray be looking good. Yeah, man, come check it out. Yeah, let me see if I can swing by there tomorrow. You guys hoping tomorrow? No, tomorrow. Sunday, boss man. But we are here today and we're also. We're here Monday. Okay, Monday work better for you? No, I'll be working Monday, man. Well, come on out today, man. You're right down the road. Okay, I'll see if I can swing by. Okay. I'm here till [TIME], man. So, I mean, if we could do about maybe [TIME] or [TIME] [TIME] [TIME], would that work for you? I'll see. What the. I'll see. What is your name? Go ahead and send me. Text me your name. Okay. What's the best for you? Okay, I'm gonna send you a text right now with my name in there. And like I said, I definitely want to put us, you know, some type of a time in that way I can kind of be looking out for you and also keep an eye on the trucks. I can't give you any time because I don't know how when I'm gonna get out of here. Okay. Oh, yeah, Gotta get that. Yeah, I'm getting that. Over. Yeah, I totally get that. Yeah, sounds good, boss. Okay, so I'm gonna shoot you a text right now, man, and like I said, I look forward to checking out your RAV4 when you get here so we can look at some Tacomas together and kind of see what we can do for you.

"Hello? Yes, hello. Oh, hi, can I be transferred to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], please? Who in the [ORGANIZATION]? It doesn't matter. I just need to speak to a [OCCUPATION]. I need to know about my [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] right now. Okay. My car was total loss in the flood and they told me my [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] it have not been paid off and they said they signed it to [ORGANIZATION]. So I need to find out some information on that. I will transfer you to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. More than likely they're going to tell you have to come in person. But let me transfer you over. All right? Okay, no problem. They sent it to [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] is the one supposed to distribute out the tank. So they talking about how to talk to them the rest of it. Hi, yes, who am I speaking to? I'm sorry, is Mr. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. No, this is not. They was, they was transferring me, transferring my call to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. No, you could manage anybody, no problem. I'm so sick of [ORGANIZATION]. I don't be calling them, calling them. Leave voicemail. Nobody returned my call. They return my car about somebody saying I called about a car. I didn't call about no car. Hello? Hello? Hi. Hi, good morning. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Is this the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, ma' am. Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Hi. Okay, yes, I have a question. I bought my car from you guys. It was almost like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, but my car got total loss in flood so my insurance paid it off. So [ORGANIZATION] told me that I will have to call you guys to see if you receive the check or did you turn it out? I mean call. Because I keep looking on my account and say I still owe money. So I'm just calling to see what's going on with that. I need to get in another car. Okay, so you were. Hold on one second. You had a total loss, you filed a claim with your insurance company. The amount of the that you owed the bank was more than the insurance was willing to pay, correct? Correct. Okay. Did you file a claim with the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yes. And they thought, when I spoke to them, they told me they signed the check. I already the checks out to you guys and that I need to call. So you're gonna see that they sent it to my. Okay, so that would be [ORGANIZATION], the bank. We're, we're just the dealerships. We have the loan side of it. We don't haven't even access to the information. So you would have to call that, you know, like on your bill that goes in the mail or that you get emailed or like when you Log in your account, you can download your bill for the [DURATION]. The number that's on there, you gotta call [ORGANIZATION]. Oh, I never do that. Always just pay [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. That's who I got. Okay. Oh, you have [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], not [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, so you gotta, you gotta call the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] number. The. And just let's see. When I talked to [ORGANIZATION], they told me to call [ORGANIZATION] because they were sending the checks to you guys. So am I. They would never send the check to us, my dear. They would be sending it directly to. To the dealership. We've. Yeah, we don't get [ORGANIZATION] checks. We're not that lucky. They would always go directly to whoever your lien holder is on the car. So if it was [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] getting the check. See, that's not what they told me. So. Oh my God. They got me doing a run around. Okay, so they put the date. They probably just said [ORGANIZATION] mistakenly, when in reality they told me they said [ORGANIZATION]. And [ORGANIZATION] is the one that got to send it out to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is what the lady told me. The [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] said that? Yes. Or your regular insurance. Because I mean, the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. No [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], the regular insurance had already paid off. The third party company, [ORGANIZATION] is the one, told me that because they got two checks they sending out, one for [DATE] and one for [DATE]. So I'm trying to see what's going on. So that's why they told me to call [ORGANIZATION] because [ORGANIZATION] is the one supposed to send it to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. So that's why I've been calling. Okay, so, yeah, I don't, I've never heard of that before, so I don't want to. And of course I'm not making it up. Obviously somebody told you that. All I could tell you is I'm gonna have to take your info and I don't even know who to ask you. What's your number, my dear? Okay, and what is your, what's your first name again? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, [PERSON_NAME]. I was like, I thought there was a [ORGANIZATION] in there. Okay, and what's your last name? [PERSON_NAME]. Did you already get another car? You try to get another car? I'm trying to get because that loan is out. I can't do nothing. Got it. Okay, so our [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] from, from when we sold you the car told you that they sent us at this dealership a ch. Yes. And that you guys is the one that have to pay [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, I will go talk to my [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] and somebody will call you back. All right.

But I don't mind coming down to the store if you could beat that price or kind of sweeten the deal. So just. That would be my very first question because it looks like I can just do everything online, buy it and just come pick it up. So, yeah, could you tell me if you have any more rebates you could offer if I come in the store? Or how does that work? What price are you getting online? Because there's no way to buy the vehicle online. It's just going to give you an estimated price. Actually, no, there was. I think it's a relatively new thing that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] has started. Like, I was all the way through.

Definitely. Where are you calling from as well? [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]. Yeah, it's my [PHONE_NUMBER]. I know. Well, it looks like we do have some four runner pros coming in. However, they're not on the ground yet. Kind of how people just putting deposits on vehicles that are coming in and reserving them that way. And then once they get here, coming, looking at them, make sure they love them and then moving forward with the purchase. And when would those be coming in, just out of curiosity? So it looks like they're coming from [LOCATION]. The vessel has departed to [LOCATION]. They're expected to arrive in [LOCATION] right around the [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], and then I'm guessing be here [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE] [DATE]. Okay. Okay.

"Good afternoon. Thanks for choosing [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME], who I have the pleasure speaking with [PERSON_NAME]. My name's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And you've probably already sold it, but I was, I saw on Facebook last night you have a [ORGANIZATION] Lacrosse. Yes. Low mileage. Do you still have that? Yes, ma' am, it is. They're currently available. Are you okay? Oh, yes, ma' am. I bought. We. My [MARITAL_STATUS] and I bought a Volkswagen from y' all before, but my granddaughter is the one that we're looking around for car for. And so the mileage is correct? Yes, ma' am, it is correct. And it was actually a one vehicle. I beg you. I beg your pardon. Yes, ma' am. Okay, that's what I was gonna ask you. What do you think about that car for a [PERSON_AGE] year old? I think it's a good car. You're actually the second customer I had come through and if the first was a [PERSON_AGE] year old vehicle and she actually liked the car, her mom, you know, said it was an older person car. But for her to be a [PERSON_AGE] year old, personally, she liked the car. And I think it's a really good first car, honestly, because it's a one owner vehicle. The [MEDICAL_CONDITION] are very low, the body is in, you know, good condition. And giving it to a [PERSON_AGE] year old, we know that, you know, is going to get bumps and all that good things done to it. So personally I wouldn't go get a [PERSON_AGE] year old a brand new vehicle. Well, she was T boned and she had a [ORGANIZATION] for [PERSON_NAME], but she was T bound on 259 and so now she moved in with a boyfriend. Anyway, she's needing another car. Is there any kind of warranty on? Ma' am, I said I can send you some additional photos of the [ORGANIZATION] if you'd like. Can you send them to me on my phone and then I can send them to her to see if she might want to look at it. Of course. What's a good telephone number for you? Okay, I have that down for you. And you know, [PERSON_AGE] year olds, they don't have a lot of credit, but she does have a little bit of money from the car that she got hit with and they drove off. So that's what I was looking at. She's going to need something that if she has to finance any of it, it would be low payments. You know, she works, but she's also going to school. So. Is she working today? Yes, ma' am. I believe she. Well, I believe it's [TIME] to [TIME] today. She's not living with me anymore. Now I'm a grandmother and. But I can send this to her and see if she'd be interested in going over there and looking at it, her and her boyfriend. And if not, do you have anything other than. Than that on the lot that might be something that you would look at? I know you may not have used that for us on the lot, but. Yes. And one said whenever I go down to take pictures of the [ORGANIZATION], I can send over additional photos of similar vehicles. Okay. All right. Can you do that for me? Yes, ma' am. Go ahead. Oh, you need my email? Email or just. Yeah, over to you. [PHONE_NUMBER], [TIME], [PHONE_NUMBER]. Or I can email, whichever works better. You can text it over to me and that way I'm. I'm better at sending it to her for myself. Okay. Yes, and I'll go ahead and get them sent over to you. Okay. If you don't mind doing that. And I will let you know either way if we're coming to look at it. All right, fair enough. Till [TIME] today. All right. Thank you, ma' am. Thank you. I'll talk to you soon. All right, bye.

He doesn't want black, red, white, blue, so I just named everything. And a light gray, he doesn't like either because he had those colors. Yeah, so you said a green. Green, Yeah. I don't have a green one available at this time, but we're scheduled to get an allocation tomorrow of a bunch of new incoming vehicles. If I see a green one, I can let you know. Okay. Or you have that magnetic gray. He doesn't want that light silver. He wants the darker. Right? The darker gray is better. Yeah, the darker gray. Let me see here. I have a Tacoma TRD Sport, 3.5 liter, V6 automatic, 4x4 double cab in the magnetic gray. This one has a black fabric interior as well. Would this seem like to be something of interest for you? Asking how many, which color they have it in stock? He's telling you he's a magnetic gray, the only one. No. What other colors do you have in stock? At the moment he's saying, well, all of my Tacomas are incoming. I don't have any brand new ones here on the lot. All Tacomas are, you know, incoming, available for reservation. Okay. What was that? I'm sorry. If he, you know, he wants to come in and check it out, but he said if they're in transit, when would you get them by? It depends on the, you know, the specific model. That one specifically is probably going to be here sooner than later. It's in an earlier delivery. So we're hoping probably anytime.

And I don't want to be tethered to the local people to do it. You know what I mean? Yeah. Okay, let me check with. Because I work with two different, like, you know, general insurance people who kind of go through anyone. Like the ones that kind of branch out. So I'll see if they have direct [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, and then. Yeah, and then if not, hopefully they resolve their issue by then, but. Well, so if you don't have any way of adding this car to the policy, then I'm not. Then there's not much sense in us coming to get it. We're just gonna have to reschedule until we're able to get a hold of somebody. Okay. Okay, so I'll call you back. Sounds good. Let me check with my.

"Good morning, this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Do you have any [ORGANIZATION] XLE in the parking lot for viewing A great day [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. How may help you? Hey, man, I was wondering, did you have any [ORGANIZATION] XLE trim in the lot for viewing? Any of them? Yeah, let me go ahead and check for you. It's a nice choice. Had a few calls when the cameras already this morning. Now, on the xle, are you wanting one in the four cylinder? The six cylinder? Four. The four. And then is there any preference on our color, exterior, interior? Yes, I do. It's gonna be. I believe that one is like a pearl white option. That's the main. If there's any other, like a dark gray or something, like I said, I have to see them. I'm just looking at them through the pictures. But the purple white is one one of them that I'm interested in. All right, and then what's your preference on the interior? Lighter or darker shades? Do you have red? Isn't there red available? That's only on the xse. Wait, did I say xle? Wait, okay. No, it is the xle. Yes. Well, let me make sure I have this right. So I just been doing a whole bunch of research and whatnot, and after [DURATION], I don't know why I'm just realizing this, but I kind of wanted the bigger rims and stuff. But the thing is that when you go bigger rims, you get a rougher ride in a way. So I know that the LE has a smooth ride because of the 17 inch. So the tires are bigger, so it's like more cushion. The problem with that car is it's just too basic. I hear the [ORGANIZATION] last a very long time, and I plan to keep the car for a very long time. I feel like the car's interior is pretty outdated, so I can only imagine it in the future. When I wrote Forum, they said that the Exo LE has like some kind of suspension or something that differs from the XE and the. What else? What else is there? Xst. So do I have that right? The XLE has a different suspension? Yes. I mean, they're all gonna have their own different suspension. But the thing is that SE and they actually have the same wheels, rim and tire package. The se, I get lost. Which one's which? The SE and the X, S, E, xle. XLE have the same rims? They have the exact same rims. Okay, but what about the suspension? Are they different? That's a good question. I don't want to give you false information. I mean, I've never, I don't think they're gonna have different suspension. They're gonna drive fairly the same. The only one that I know has a different suspension is the trd. Yeah, that one is. Yeah, I know that one. But I, I come. But when it, when it comes to the XSE and the xle, I mean, they're the same drivetrain, same engine, same transmission. I mean that suspension shouldn't be different whatsoever. Let me see if I, So if I go on the [ORGANIZATION] side. Well, would you be able to check just to see if you had any. Meantime, while I look for these features. So the SE has a independent [ORGANIZATION] strut front suspension with stabilizer bar. Which one's that one? That's the se. Yeah. And it has a sports tuned shock absorbers and springs for the front end for. And springs with the front strut tower bracing. Yeah, that's the only. Yeah, because not even the LE has that. The SE is the only one that has that option. Unless you go with the xse, it has the same one. And then the only other one that's going to change is going to be the V6 Camry. So the, the XSE and the SE have those suspensions? The SE and the XSE was the ones that has those [ORGANIZATION] suspension. Yes. Or just the XSE, XSE and the SE. Okay, I, I, Why are people saying that the XLE has, The XLE does not have a. That's what I'm saying. It's not a sports Camry. It's a luxury Camry. It's not going to have a different suspension on the vehicle. I see. That's only a test drive. That's what I mean, like if you had any. So let me, let me go. Yeah, let me go ahead and do this for you so I don't waste your time. I want to check what's available and what's going to be coming in the next [DURATION] [DURATION]. Should take about [DURATION] [DURATION]. Are you calling from home or from work? And that number is [PHONE_NUMBER]. What? [PHONE_NUMBER]. All right, thank you.

Was it a trade in or did you buy it at the auction? Or you know anything about it at all? I believe because the owner drove it for a while. That's why it's been on our website for a while. Just because he's been driving it and he dropped it off to us like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. So I don't remember where the car came in, more than likely. I can't. I can't. I can see, unfortunately. Okay. Before I drive all the way down there, I mean, is there anybody there? Do you. Do you have anybody that's qualified to look at the car and determine if it has any paint work done to it or. I know what a carfax is, but is there anybody there that can actually lay eyes on it and. And do walk around, you know, and look and see? I'm interested in the car. If we can get the price right and if it's never been wrecked or repainted, then I'd definitely be interested in it. Definitely. I can ask my [OCCUPATION], who I know, he appraised it [DURATION] [DURATION] ago when we got it back from the owner, so he would definitely know how to top up his head because he's been dealing with the car.

Yeah, I don't have any right now on the lot. What questions do you have? Yeah, I'm more. Of course, I'm more interested about how much is the price. Okay. It depends on the trim level that you're looking for. What is the L? Okay, let me see if I can pull it up for you. Yeah, at least more or less. I have an idea. Okay, so you don't. Okay, just a second. Okay. About [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And do you take. What financing do you accept? I'm sorry, I said that one more time. Yeah.

Yes, we have some that are incoming, but most of them are sold before they hit the lot. When could you come in and we can show you the ones that are incoming and it'll be yours.

What color do you see? What color are you looking for? Do you have black or white? I have black. I have black, white, red, green. I got them all. When could you come to? When you said you don't have it in the lot. If I am available this afternoon, would you be able to show me anything? Yes, I can show you. We have all on the wall with different colors. They have. They have different arrivals. The car is not. There's no Corolla Cross sitting on someone's lot right now. It's a needle and a haystack. That's why people are buying them. They come in.

"This call may be recorded for quality and training purposes. Thanks for calling [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] in [ORGANIZATION]. How can I help you? Hi, I had a couple of questions for you about the RAV4 prime, if you had a minute. Yes, yes. Yeah, certainly. So I was looking. I wanted to see if one you had any available that I could test drive. Okay. I'd love to take a look there. And then what else were you thinking? Just more curiosity about. I've heard there's like a very long wait time to get them and I wanted to see if that was something that's true or just something I'm hearing on the Internet, like what your timeline looks like for those and then if you have any labor. Okay. And if you had any [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] [ORGANIZATION]. Certainly. So I will have to check my inventory for that vehicle. It might take me a little bit of time. Is there a good number to reach on? Yeah, [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER]. All right. And then what's a good first and last name for you? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Wait, what was it? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and then [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Perfect. All right, [PERSON_NAME], I think I'd save us some time into a search right now. Do you mind if I put you on a brief hold while I look for that vehicle? That's totally good. Thank you. Yeah. Give me one second. Oh, I lost my cart. Nothing. I'm on hold. Have a sip of that water. The bathroom was like all around. Yeah. So we don't have any here to test drive. I don't have any on our used side and on new. It looks like we have one on the ground. This is sold to someone else. So we might be able to open it up and look at it, but we cannot drive it. Okay. But we could kind of like sit in it and look at it. Yeah. Yeah. I'd have to get with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [PERSON_NAME] and make sure that's okay. But that's something I would be able to do in terms of wait times for new. I can do a search right now while I have you on the phone. Yeah. Especially like wondering the one that you have that's going to someone how long that took for them to get it. Yeah. So I can speak to that. Do you know, it sounds like you've done a little bit of research. Do you know which trim level you are leaning towards? An SE or an SE Yeah. I can't remember the name of the two, but the one that comes the higher end, one that has the leather sheets. Okay. You wonder. So that is the one that is taking a long time. So I can speak. What is a long time? Let me look at the list right now and I can give you kind of a ballpark range. So 4550 is that model code. So just to speak to that, we have [MONEY_AMOUNT] people waiting for that vehicle and it looks like we're getting about two per [DURATION]. So that, I mean it's probably going to be close to [DURATION] [DURATION] for an xse. Okay, and what's the difference in the two trim packages? So I mean the se you're going to have different rims, you're going to have cloth seats, there's a long list of differences. And what's the wait time for that one? I think I can get you one of those much sooner. Give me one second. So the difference between the two on an xse, these are the addeds that the XSE has that the others doesn't. So it has vertical LED headlight, headlights, black painted outside mirrors, power tilt moonroof, color keyed mirrors and roof, red shock absorbers, 19 inch rims. You also have front center vent flow control, 10 inch touch screen, 11 [ORGANIZATION] speakers, drive connect [DURATION] [DURATION] trial, 12.3 inch digital multi information display, overhead console, blue ambient lighting, auto dimming rear view mirror with homelink wireless charging, softex transformation seats, seat back pocket for driver's seat, steering wheel mounted paddle shifters. We have anti slip in dash storage trays, red accent interior, soft touch dash, silver interior door handles, power tilt controls and overhead console. You also have backup camera, dynamic grid lines, wireless charger for your phone and anti theft system. Yeah, I really would want the higher end package. Okay. And it's a [DURATION] [DURATION] wait you said? Yeah, I mean it's probably going to be about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] to [DURATION] [DURATION] for the xse. Okay, thank you, that helps. And that's if the, if the production stays the same, if they speed it up, we'll be able to get these cars out and that will be a shorter. Is there any indication of that happening or any response from them as to why they're making so few? It seems like it's a pretty popular car. Yeah, it's a popular car. It's just right now we are still dealing with a chip shortage and so chips, a car with this amount of technology, it requires more chips and therefore it's not as profitable or makes as much sense to pump out tons of them. I see. Okay, that answers the question. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Did you want to put your Name on the list for it. No, I think that's all right. We have a kit on the way, so we really need something within the next like [DURATION] [DURATION]. So it's not going to work out. What attracted you to the prime? We want a four wheel drive plug in hybrid that has. That's like a suv. Do you have any interest in all electric like the BZ4X? The what? [ORGANIZATION] has an all electric SUV. We want the hybrid. You got to have the plug in hybrid. Gotcha. Yeah, my [MARITAL_STATUS] pretty set on the wanting of a hybrid part. The best way to get one of these probably before you have the baby is look towards used market for that or a little bit of flexibility on trim level because like an SE, like let's see here, [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So we have two people waiting for the SE. So I could probably get you a SE Prime. And what's the cost difference on that? So like the XSE are usually like the high [MONEY_AMOUNT], even into the [MONEY_AMOUNT], depending on if they have the premium package. Got it. Yeah. Like without the premium package you're looking at like about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. With the premium package you're looking at about [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But most of your SEs depending on packages are [MONEY_AMOUNT] and some change. Okay. Yeah. I think if the big thing that you're looking for is leather and heat, we can add that to that vehicle for [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So you're still saving about, you know, depending. You're saving about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] by going with a lower trim level and adding heat and leather aftermarket. No, we're one more down. Let me. Yeah, let me think about that. What? Like we'd want the heated. We'd want the weather and the sunroof. The moonroof. So we'd have to find. We'd put you on the list for one that specifically has the CO package. It looks like. So just like moonroof is not something we can add here aftermarket. That needs to be part of the build. But out of the hold up. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.5ses that we have in our system right now. Four of those have the weather and moonroof package. So those. And those are currently available. No, none of these are available. But these are just. I'm speaking to what we currently have in our pipeline. Oh, like coming down the line. Yeah. Coming to customers that have already put their names on them. But so say you wanted to put your name in line for this. You give us the parameters of what you're looking for. Say you're open to gray and silver. And it has to have the CO package which gives you moonroof and weather package. We put that in the list. We don't call you unless a vehicle that matches your specifications comes in. You know what I mean? And at that point we put your name on the vehicle. No one else can touch it. Just once it gets here, we have you come in and finalize paperwork. I see, so there's nothing down beforehand? Nothing. What down what? Like to go on the list? Nothing? No, not right now. So. And also those two other people that I see on the list, they will receive their cars before you because they've been waiting. So we give these cars in order of the deposits being placed. Got it. But I mean, if we have five primes in our system right now, that usually shows like about [DURATION] [DURATION] allocation. So I mean, if there's only two people waiting, I feel like you'll probably get you your name on one of these within the next [DURATION] or so and then after that. And that's also, you know, with maybe some color flexibility. But after you get your name on the vehicle, we usually see them in about, you know, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Got it. Okay. And then if there, if it's coming with this weather and moonroof package, these seem to already have the heat. We would just be putting leather on them. And you would still be able to do that? Yeah, yeah, we could totally do that. Could you email me the difference between the two trim levels and then what you could get like what you could put into it? Like what that co whatever packages with the moonroof and the all weather. So I'll send you a spec sheet of each. Each one. I'll send you a spec sheet for an SE [DURATION] [DURATION] spec sheet for an xse. Okay. And then in that, it would be helpful for me if you could kind of indicate in the email what packages that we could you have coming in on the search that I could then add the leather sheets too? Yeah. The SE package will be the CO package which is the weather and moonroof. So in the spec sheet it outlines what is in that package. It says weather and moonroof package includes heated leather trim, steering wheel, rear outboard passenger, heated seating, rain sensing, variable, intermittent windshield wipers with de icer function and tilt slide, moonroof with one touch open and close. So that, I mean it's pretty self explanatory. When you see the weather moonroof package, it tells you what it is. Yeah, yeah, that would be great. But like things we won't be able to do is change the shock. Like we can't give you red shock absorbers, the black painted outside mirrors. That's something we won't be doing right. And I don't really care about rams, you know what I mean? So, I mean, what about the sound system? What's the difference? There it is, upgraded to a [ORGANIZATION] system. So that's something that you could do aftermarket, you know. Got it. So, yeah, I don't think it's. I mean, there are a lot of small differences, but like the guts of the vehicle are the same. And then with the weather package, it gets the SE close to the xse. If you're not too worried about small cosmetic features. Right, yeah, if you could send me that, that would be. If you could email me the differences. And how late are you guys open tonight? We are open till [TIME] I will be leaving at [TIME] okay. And can you remind me what you said your name was? Yeah, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. So I'm going to need your email as well, [PERSON_NAME], to send you this. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. And so with this comparison that I have here, I think I'm going to try and save it as a PDF, but it's like a access granted through a passcode for [OCCUPATION]. I don't know why they don't have this open to the public. So let me know if you can open this or not. I'm going to try and send that to you. That's why I was thinking just sending two spec sheets might work better. Okay, yeah, whatever. But I'm going to try and send this. I think I've sent it before and people said, oh, you need an access code to get into this. Okay, yeah, just send it and I'll let you know if I have issues with it. Sounds good. Sounds good. Thank you so much. Yeah, thanks for calling, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, absolutely. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.",success,inventory_check,RAV4 Prime,medium,False,1012270058bf4292b8f751f686bacb6b_transcript.json

Yes, the one the. The [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] area. What's his name? I forgot his name. [PERSON_NAME], probably. It's [PERSON_NAME]. [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Yeah, give me one second, I'll see if he's available. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you for holding us. And [PERSON_NAME] there. This is [PERSON_NAME]. I don't know if you remember. How are you? I'm good, how are you? I'm good. I'm trying to get in touch with [PERSON_NAME], but he's. They say that man always busy. He is always busy. Yes, ma' am. He's been on conference calls [DURATION] [DURATION] today. How can I help you? Okay, I'm just. I just want to know what's, you know what, what's going on? Did you have any CX30? CX30s? Yeah, [PERSON_NAME]. CX30? Yeah. You're the one that. You are the one that. He told me that while he was on vacation. You will help me? Yeah, I'll help you. Yeah, yeah, I would be. I'm his right hand man. So yeah, I'll be happy. Oh, okay. Okay. So what, what do you, what do you have in CX 30s? I currently have 15 of them on the ground right now. I have selects, I have preferreds, I have premiums, I have. No, no, no. I won. Of course, the least expensive one, which is the. The S, the sport one. I don't have any S. Is in stock right now. I have a select. Which is the next least expensive. I have one of those. Why talk about it if I don't have the money? Know what I mean? No, I got you, I got you. Let me see what I've got coming. LX, I'm looking at the LX. There's no LX. There's an SE, there's a 2.5 F and there's an SE, which is a select. Yeah, yeah, the SE, that's a select. I have. I have a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] those on the ground now. How much are those? Those Ones start at. I'll tell you exactly the ones I've got. I'll tell you the cheapest one. I got those ones started. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] to be exact. No, the one I'm. The one I'm saying is the one that xd. I forgot the initials with the S next to it. Which one? That's going to be a 2.5s. That one starts at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes, you do. You have one. So I don't have one here currently. I have one on the water that's supposed to get to [LOCATION] at the [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DURATION], and then we should probably see that car about the [DURATION] [DURATION] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yeah, those ones are very limited. I don't know. I'm gonna have to go to. I don't know where, which date to get the car. Yeah, they're just so hard to come by with, you know, with the [EVENT] and everything. When [ORGANIZATION], with all manufacturers, they came out with all the higher trim models first, and then the lower trim started to trickle in later. And then, of course, as soon as you get them, you sell them because they're so much less expensive than the rest of them. You sell them out quickly, of course. Yeah, yeah, that one's a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] cheaper than the select, but I'm not going to see that car till [DATE_INTERVAL]. Which one is. So how much? What's the price again? That one. The MSRP on that car is going to be [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Yeah, the one you know, because I told [PERSON_NAME]. I already told him. I don't know if I did or not, but it was a little less. The [MONEY_AMOUNT] is not bad, but I think it was [MONEY_AMOUNT], something like that, but anyway. Or [MONEY_AMOUNT], I don't know. Anyway. So what color. Do you know what color is? Yeah, that one. Yeah, it's going to be white with black interior. Mm. That's the one I want. Yeah, that's the one I got coming. I got it coming. You could put a deposit on a car if you wanted to, if you want that car. Let me see if it's got an eta. Let's see here. Vehicle data not available. Yeah, it's not even giving me kind of an eta. There we go. Here we go. It pulled up. It's estimated to get to [LOCATION], really any day now, but we just don't know when we're going to receive the car. Probably later this [DURATION] or [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] next [DURATION]. My guess would probably be [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] next [DURATION]. Before we see the car. Maybe the [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Wow. I mean, I don't know what it is that I'm trying to buy a car. And I've been in different dealerships. I don't know what it is, but the car that I asked for, they never have it. And I've been sitting here [DURATION] and [DURATION]. Or it's in [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. Oh, it's coming. Yeah. I don't know what to do. Yeah, it's just. I mean, we're all kind of in the same boat, you know, these cars, we, when we get them, you know, a lot of people pre order them. So when they kind of like the conversation we're having, we have customers will be okay, I'll come in, we'll agree to numbers. They give us a deposit on the car, and then the car is sold before it ever even touches [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You know, we've sold cars that are still in [LOCATION]. We sold cars that are still in [LOCATION]. We've sold cars all over the world before they ever get here because there's just the limitation on getting the car is just right. It's so strict, you know. But let me ask you this, okay? How much more after that? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. What else are you adding to the car? So all of our cars, we add window tint. I'm sure [PERSON_NAME] went over with you. We do window tint. We do LoJack on all of our cars. And then we do a signature plus program. It adds about another [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Now, if we obviously can be flexible with you on that sub, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then it's just your taxes and fees. Are you going to be paying cash or are you going to be financing? No, no, finance it. But I want to know how much other things you add. Like, you know, the. Yeah, normally I don't want tint windows. I don't like tin wind. I'm [DURATION] [DURATION] old. I'm not trying to drive a car like I'm [MONEY_AMOUNT]. No, not at all. Let me tell you, we don't tend them dark. I want somebody to see me. You don't know. If I pass out, somebody needs to see me from outside. So they're getting. I understand, I understand, I understand. All right, so if we don't do the thing, because all these options get added up front, but I could get you that, say, with taxes and everything. I mean, you could be at the door for [MONEY_AMOUNT], right? At [MONEY_AMOUNT] with taxes and everything, I may be able to. The interest rate. No, that's just the Car. And then depending. Yeah, and then depending on what you want to finance, how long you want to finance it for. I can tell you the interest rates. Give me one second here. Yeah, But I mean, [MONEY_AMOUNT] and going up to [MONEY_AMOUNT], what those $[MONEY_AMOUNT] are for? Well, you've got [OCCUPATION] fee, which is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You've got titling for the state, which is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. You've got taxes, which are $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then like I said, if I don't charge you for window tint and I don't charge you for car care, which you put on the car, and then I don't charge you for the signature plus, which is arts and things of that nature. You're still coming up [DURATION] [DURATION], right? At [MONEY_AMOUNT] if I take that off there. Yeah. Because I don't want none of that. That you guys like to ask. No, I'm not. I'm not taking that. The. The package, the. Whatever you call it, the. No, I don't want that. See, I mean, you might get it somewhere just right. Right under [MONEY_AMOUNT], if we didn't do any of that stuff. But in the best rate, as far as interest rate, what's the interest rate that you're offering? [ORGANIZATION] currently for 70. What term would you want to do? [DURATION] or [DURATION]. I think I'm gonna do maybe [DURATION]. Okay. Yeah. Then things are going to change. But [DURATION]. Of course. Yeah. [ORGANIZATION] currently is offering 5.9% for [DURATION] [DURATION] on the CX. 35.9. Yeah. Okay. And then it depends on my credit, too. That's correct, yeah. As long as your score is over [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], then you'll qualify for the 5.9. Well, I don't have [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], I'll tell you that right now. Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm. I mean, well, I haven't checked, but I don't think it's. I have [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I forgot. I gotta ask my daughter. How much? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Something I cannot remember. Well, I got the. I'm not at home, but I had the papers at home that. But then things, you know, things change, of course, change day by day. You know what I mean? That's right. Yeah. So it depends on which bureau you're looking at. So [ORGANIZATION] goes off of expense, but they will allow us to use all three. So I can use [ORGANIZATION], I can use [ORGANIZATION] with them. Just so whichever scores higher. Have you ever financed with [PERSON_NAME] before? No, no, no, first time. I'm kind of like, you know, wanted to try [ORGANIZATION]. I always bite me. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, like I said, it just depends. I mean, sometimes if we get a Tier [PHONE_NUMBER] call by [ORGANIZATION], then that's going to move the rate up into the sevens. But sometimes we're able to call the bank and get them to help us. You know, I can't promise you that because they're the ones that make the decision, but yeah, I mean, we're always willing to help. Okay. With. Let's say I qualify for the five point. 5.9. Huh? Okay, let's. Okay, so how much will be my payment? You're going to be somewhere around [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Somewhere in there. Oh, Lord. That's what, that's another thing I want to be, you know. Right. You know, less than 4. Like how much I will have to put that payment if you know, to get under [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Huh? About [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Wow. But I don't like it about, you know, that from [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], it's going to go up to [MONEY_AMOUNT] without. Without interest rate, you know, I got you. I told you I got you. I got you. The [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. If you don't do anything. Hold on, let me write this down. Wait, [MONEY_AMOUNT] what? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then you multiply that by the interest rate. No, the interest rate. So the interest rate is a daily accrual, so it's your rate. It's kind of. It's kind of hard to calculate, but your rate is going to be 5.9%. So if you did $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down based off of that number, that'll get you to 395amonth. [MONEY_AMOUNT] with. With how much? With [MONEY_AMOUNT]. $[MONEY_AMOUNT], [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, Lord. And if I do, let's say [MONEY_AMOUNT]. If you did $[MONEY_AMOUNT] down, that would get you to. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Wow. Okay. Well, and, and I talked to [PERSON_NAME] because, you know, dealership, they ask you for this deposit and he told me, don't worry, I will not ask you for a deposit. That's what you told me. No, that's fine. That's fine. I mean, I have no problem with that at all. It's just if that's the car you want. The only thing. So here's what happened. Last [DURATION], [ORGANIZATION] on the CX30 was at 6.9 for [DURATION] [DURATION]. Fortunately, they lowered it this [DURATION] to 5.9. Now next [DURATION] when the car gets here, I don't know what the rate is going to go to. It may go back up again. So the only thing I would say is if you decide if the car you want come in and let's at least get it submitted over so we can lock in your rate because they'll allow us to carry that rate into the following [DURATION] because heaven forbid next [DURATION] the rate goes back up again and we haven't submitted you, then we'll be bound to whatever that rate is. You know what I mean? Now here's the good news. If the rate was to go down again, then we can resubmit you next [DURATION] and get you the lower rate. But at least this way we can lock you in with the rate that they currently have available. I understand. Yep. But yeah, I, I really need to discard to be like a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], something like that. That's in my budget. I can't, I cannot go, you know, more. Yeah. What else do you have? Let me see. To get it, to get it any cheaper, that's really about the cheapest car that we carry. Unless you wanted to go with a certified pre owned vehicle possibly. I don't know if that's something that might be possible. The only thing is when we go, if you did, would you consider a certified car? A pre owned car. But, and I'll be honest with you, honestly at some point doesn't make sense because if you can buy this car this cheap, the certified cars are just as much if not more and they've got more miles on them and you don't get as good a rate on the certified cars. You do on the new car, right? No, I would love a new car. Again. Yeah, yeah. When I buy cars, trust me, I like to buy. I only had [MONEY_AMOUNT] new cars in my life and I always like new. I always like to be the first one city. Hey, I'm with you. I understand. I, I'm with you 100%. Guess how many [DURATION] when I buy a car I drive that car for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Are you serious? That's my old car. It's [DURATION] [DURATION] old. Wow. It's a [ORGANIZATION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. Yeah. Crap, man. Yep. Well, let me ask you this. What are you going to do with that car? I'm going to sell it. Okay. I'm going to sell it. But you guys are not going to give me, you know, I know, I understand. Yeah, no, well I mean, yeah, I mean a [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it. A [MONEY_AMOUNT] for it. Yeah, no, I understand. I mean it's tough for a dealership to give too much money on a car of that age, you know what I mean? Because we can't sell it, so. Right, right. But yeah, you'll get somebody that'll buy it from me for sure. Yeah, I'm gonna go somewhere and I have [MONEY_AMOUNT] people that they want to, you know, give me something in. Yeah. Are you [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME]? I am. Yep, that's me. Oh, okay. So anyway, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what to do anymore, but I need a car. I've been without a car for. Oh my gosh, for [DURATION] [DURATION], I think. Really? Huh. Wow. I don't know what to. And I'm, you know, I work for the school system and next week is the last week. I cannot leave without car. Yeah, well, that's just it. I mean, like I said, you can buy this one, but to get that payment, where you're looking for is going to take some cash. Dying on forest line. How do you know [PERSON_NAME], if you don't mind me asking? Well, long story. Well, to make a short. Okay. One of my [OCCUPATION] that now he is a fourth grader when he was in kindergarten, his mom and his siblings. Him and his siblings, they on this brochure, this book, the [PERSON_NAME] mom, something about she do like something, you know, the church, whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I saw when I opened it, you know, I had it from what, [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, and I was cleaning my closet and I found that and I said, oh my gosh. You know, tight it. And when I open it up, I guess I was not paying attention when he give it to me [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. But when I open it up, I start reading the story of [PERSON_NAME] family. Lost his daddy, you know, when they were little. Yeah. Eight of them. Eight of them. And I was, oh my gosh. I got on the floor saying, oh my gosh, this is a nice story. And I kept reading. But then when I kept reading about every child, what they do now as an adult, and they say, [PERSON_NAME], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is our connection. For me, I say, this. This man is going to help me get my car. That's what I said. That's awesome. Y. That's awesome. Yeah. And when I called him and I told him, I said, what? Oh my gosh. Yeah, his mom is an angel. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've had the pleasure of meeting her a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] things. Yep. Getting a car. And that's the way he helped. He helped my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and his siblings and his mom. To get a car for [PERSON_NAME] told me. Yep. Yep. Well, look, I'll. I'll get with [PERSON_NAME] if he ever gets off this conference call. They keep him on there [DURATION] [DURATION] usually, but I'll get with him and I'll let them know that you called and, you know, I mean, listen, I'm still waiting. I need a card today and tell them to do you both. You have to do homework. I don't know how you're going to work it out. My payments need a [MONEY_AMOUNT] so bad, and I want my payment to be a little bit less. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. If not, I cannot do it. I understand. Let me ask you. No, I get it. I get that. We all do. For sure. How much money can you put down? How much cash can you put down? Maybe, if I can find it. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's it? Maybe a [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Oh, don't tell me that we're going the wrong direction. Well, I'm four. Oh, stop. Listen, I'll talk. I'll talk to [PERSON_NAME] when he gets a chance and see if there's. I mean, this car, it just may be too much. But, I mean, I'll talk to him and see what he thinks, and then I'll give you a call. There's nothing. No, I know. There's no other Mazdas. I know. I get it. Trust me. Trust me. I do this every single day. I get it. I would love to get this car. I would love to. In my neighborhood, my community is [PHONE_NUMBER] 6:30 black. Oh, really? You know, yeah. And my daughter's picking me up and driving me off my house. So when she picked, you know, so when she's taking me home and I go through, I'm going, oh, my gosh, look at the girls right there. The same one. Yeah. Cute. Very cute. Yeah, well, listen, I'll talk to him as soon as he gets done. He won't be here for much of the day because he'll be heading out. But I've got your number. You're at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes. And tell him I do not want tint windows. I'm [DURATION] [DURATION] old. Like I said. I need to look outside. People need to look at. You know, that's for young people. I got you. I got you. Yeah. All right, I'll give you a call back. If I don't call you back tonight, I'll call you. You're very welcome, [PERSON_NAME]. It was nice talking to you.

I'm going to check the sold log, check to see if any deposits have been taken and also check to see if it is on the lot. Because we post our vehicles online as soon as we get them in on trade, even as they're going through the inspection process and reconditioning. So it might be down, you know, having brakes or tires or you know, detail done or something still. But let me check on all that. All those things will take me just a few [DURATION]. 5. All right, good news is it is on our lot. And let me see if any deposits are taken. [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And no deposits have been taken on it. So it's looking good so far.

You'd have to tell me if I like it how much though, because that's where I. That's where I was. That's why I haven't gotten a car yet, because all these [OCCUPATION] tell me, oh, come look at the car. And the price that's here ends up not being the price. So. No, we will. We will. We will honor the price that is on the west side. Right, but then you also charge, like, $[MONEY_AMOUNT] more, right, for the other stuff? No, no, I gotta show you, with taxes, title from fees, how much it's gonna be. But remember that. That taxes, you have to pay your taxes. Let me. Let me confirm the card first. And then tomorrow morning. Yeah, tomorrow morning I'm gonna text you that information, and from that point, we're gonna be moving forward. So we open tomorrow. Let me know, let me know.

Can you maybe name a name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] or [PERSON_NAME]. Probably [PERSON_NAME]. I think he took it over from [PERSON_NAME] because [PERSON_NAME] was the one that originally sold it to us [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Doing something else now. Okay, so you're just wondering what mattress is in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] that you have, right? Yeah, like what the. You know what mattress it is? Like, because, you know, they. The way they do on the supply, it's like mattress 34 by 80 with contour corner right and left, 8 inch depth. Like, that's like the description. Like, I don't know. Okay. And what was your name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Do you mind if I put you on hold and. Sure, I'll search. I'm gonna search for the best person to send you to, so one moment. You better hold on. Hold on tight. You don't have to tell me twice. No, you don't have to tell me twice. Thought I knew about love When I was [PERSON_AGE] I cared more about her than I cared about me. Had to learn how to walk the line like [PERSON_NAME] said. Thanks for holding on. I'm going to send you over to [ORGANIZATION] and they'll be able to help you out. Sure. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, is this [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. Hey, I got a question for you. So I just picked up an [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] edition. [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. And brand new, ordered it [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. I am on the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] website and I want to order the custom mattress encasement and I don't. You want to order the mattress? Custom mattress? No, the custom mattress encasement. Custom mattress encasement, yes. Or is that a cover or something? Yeah, it's a protector. So the mattress in case that wash, a washable, easy to remove mattress encasement. Zip to protect your mattress on all [PERSON_AGE] sides. And so I'm on the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] website and it says, use our custom mattress selector to determine the best mattress for your [ORGANIZATION]. Simply input the model and model [DURATION]. Well, when you go under mattress name or when you go under [ORGANIZATION] name. Right. They don't list the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] edition. They got Globetrotter, Classic, Bambi, Caribou, Flying Cloud. What [DURATION] your history? Well, it's brand new, and I ordered it [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL]. So is it [DATE_INTERVAL] or [DATE_INTERVAL] or. I am not sure. Like that. Did you buy it here? Yep, I just picked it up. It's [ORGANIZATION] Ball K O z. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yep. [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yeah, it's the 28 RB [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] SE [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay. With the. The twin. I got the twin. Twin bed. Okay. Yep. Okay. And your first name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And a good program. I could reach out [PERSON_NAME], do some checking, and I could surely call you that. So you need. So you got two twin beds in there, right? Yep. So you need two of those in patients. Yep. Okay. And I'm just. I went on the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] website and. And I was. I just don't know. You know what? Yeah, they probably won't let you order it from the manufacturer either. Is there a good phone number, [PERSON_NAME]? Yeah, one. Okay, well, I'll check into it right now and I'll try to call you back here in a few minutes. Yeah, so it doesn't. I mean, it looks like I can order it or you can. Yeah, I just don't know. Oh. Oh, I don't. Well, I'm gonna pull up your information. Does he ask for a VIN number or anything? No, it just in this custom mattress selector, it tells you to enter the [ORGANIZATION] main and the [ORGANIZATION] [DURATION]. Well, the most current [DURATION] that they have is [DATE_INTERVAL]. Well, no, it's [DATE_INTERVAL]. That's the newest they have. Yep, that's the newest that they have. And then they don't even list under [ORGANIZATION] name the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] edition. They only list Flying Kyle Classic, International, Globetrotter, Bambi and Caracal. So I don't know. Is what's in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] edition? Is it basically the classic, you know, plus some, or I don't. That's a good question. See what I'm saying? Is it just an addition of the classic? Like, you know, it's the same mattress that's in the Classic, but I got [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] sheet. You Know like. Yeah, well, let me see what I could come up with. That's a 28 RBT. Does it give you a room to put a 28 RBT in there? Because it's an [ORGANIZATION] 28 RBT [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. And it looks like, you know, when I just put Classic, when I clicked on [DATE_INTERVAL], which is the most recent. Right. The only thing that came up for [DATE_INTERVAL] was the classic. And there is a couple standard mattresses and then there's a couple twin mattresses that they list. And the standard is the 60 by 75 width, [PERSON_AGE] inch radius corners adjustable. And then the twin is the 3680 with 3 inch notch adjustable right and left. And it doesn't matter if you're in the classic 30 RV or the classic 33 RB, it's like the same mattress. So that's just, you know, I don't know if the [DATE_INTERVAL]. They just don't have the [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] like listed yet. But it's basically the same dimension. So did you happen to measure your beds with them? I haven't done that. I just, I mean, I don't know if that's important, but I'm just trying to get all the information. Yeah, they do the custom. I, I think they do ask you to do that to verify, but I wanted to at least start with, you know, using their selector and it's just. Sure. I think they, it's a special order. So I think they're custom. Yeah, I may have to call them, you know, to reach out to them and see. Yeah, I'm not able to call them. Like I went on the [ORGANIZATION] website and it doesn't look like there's a phone number that I can call. Yeah, if you could ask them that, that would be great. Like I would like to know for those two mattress. I needed to put some kind of put not a mattress pad but like an encasement, you know, protector and then. Right. The other thing is the, you know how the table converts into a bed. Right. Is there anything I can put on that? Like, to protect what cushion? Protect the cushions? Yeah, like, other than look bad, is there anything. Because like my butt and my son, you know, he's [PERSON_AGE] and he can wet the bed sometimes and if he's sleeping on that, I mean, I guess I first need to know, like I don't even know did it come with, you know, when that's folded into a bed, does that even, does it even come with sheets for that or. I think I just saw Sheets for the two twins. But like, you know, when the table converts to a bed, I mean, where do you get those kind of sheets? Yeah, I don't know that you're gonna get a, like a fitted sheet. I don't know that you're gonna get one, but I could sure check on that too. Yeah. And like that would be like what the, you know, what the bedding is for that, you know, table that converts into a bed. I think it's like a double bed. Right. Like, I need like, you know, fitted sheet and then I need some kind of protector to protect those cushions. Yeah. The only thing I was thinking about, [PERSON_NAME] could put a light piece of foam mattress on there, you know, just so then, you know, you don't want rubbing on there. You know, rolling around on that bed. You know, I could see, you know, something maybe happened to that fabric on those cushions. I don't know. And I know that's your concern. Yeah, I just, like I said. Well, if you could just kind of find out those questions and. Yeah, I think I might. In the meantime, we're going to go out to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] this weekend and I might just go up to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and grab like a twin protector, you know, that's pretty cheap. You know, we can always use those in hotel rooms or something and just throw them, even though they won't fit, you know, perfectly. Like, just throw them. Especially where he's gonna sleep, throw it on that, you know, just to protect it. So we, we come up with the solution, you know, the long term solution. He's gonna keep it, you know, keep it new for a long time. Yeah, there are a few that's more fitted, that's more custom. Sure. Yeah. You get something loose on there and you know, just kind of rub. Yeah, good. Possibly. I don't know. And I think probably like this weekend, you know, if I can get something to cover the cushions and then put some kind of bottom sheet. I mean, he'll just, you know, you just throw a blanket on top of him, you know, and he'll be fine. But I just wanted something that was more fitted, like long term. No, I understand what you're cool. Looking for. Well, let me do some checking. Yeah. If I don't get back with you today, I'll definitely get back with you in the morning. And I'm not sure someone called us that there's some [ORGANIZATION] that you guys have. I think there was something, you know, with the shower and you know, you were wondering about when we were going to come up to get that taken care of. I'm going to try to look up and see what those [ORGANIZATION], you know, what. What's come in for. So [ORGANIZATION] ball. K O Z. Uh, got you here. Let's just see. So somebody called you and said that we had [ORGANIZATION] here for you. Yeah, because I remember whoever it was that did our show, there was something with the shower. And I think there was something with the table too. It's looking up these work orders here. She called us. I don't see where they got [ORGANIZATION] here. Shower head leaking. These. Replacement component failure. That's probably what it is. Let me just pull that up. If it's just a shower head, your [MARITAL_STATUS] can do that. I thought there was some kind of part because they were asking about when we were going to bring it. Yeah, I don't know if you want to follow up on that. I'm locked up now. So the part you here looks like that front ceiling fan rubbing and making excessive noise. Fan doing excessive noise. Thought fan was rubbing on the shroud. After removing. After removing the fan blade. Found that the motor is binding and needs to be replaced. So looks like we ordered a new fan motor. And then that shower head was leaking. Shower head leaking at the base of the threads. Maybe crack. Took pictures through our card. It looks like that part is here. So we got the shower head, and then we got a ceiling fan. The motor. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna have to. Because we're down here in [LOCATION]. I know. I mean, like, when we're gonna, like. See, we're not gonna. We're going up to [LOCATION] in [DATE_INTERVAL] and we're gonna stay. We're gonna stay a night at the [ORGANIZATION] on the way up to [LOCATION]. Here in [LOCATION]? Yeah, in [LOCATION]. Well, maybe we can get done. You get those two items done for you. I mean, I know the shower head, but I don't know about that motor. If your [MARITAL_STATUS] wants getting too involved with that. So. Yeah, and I don't know, I like if we can just get by. If not, you're having that done until [DATE_INTERVAL]. We're not really, like, doing anything. We're going to go to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. We're gonna go down to [LOCATION]. Well, what I could do is if you wanted to, we're just gonna do, like, some stuff around [LOCATION] here. And then our big trip is to go up to [LOCATION]. Yeah, I mean, I'd be more than happy to have somebody talk to one of the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] in charge, but I could have them send this motor and that shower head, that way you have it in your possession if you'd like, if that's what you're concerned about. Yeah, I don't know. I'll just have to ask [PERSON_NAME] because we don't. Can someone down here do it? Well, they wouldn't do it under warranty. I know that. I mean, yeah, that's true. We would, you know, we would be in a tenair stream, you know, if you bought this somewhere else, you know, we would do it. Let me just see what the deal is and see if we. When we can get up there, you know. Yeah, the gentleman you're supposedly working with in the services. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Yeah. But anyway, if you want to work something out with him as far as having the part sent to you, we can do it that way or whatever you want to do. I'm. I'm not super worried about, you know, I just. I know you'll hang on to the [ORGANIZATION]. I just. I think we just need to nail down, you know, when we can get it up there and. Sure. It may be something. He may have to just drive it up there, you know. Just drive up. Yeah. And back. No, in [DURATION] [DURATION] or whatever works best for you guys. Would you be able to knock that out pretty easily? Well, I would make sure we set up. I would let [PERSON_NAME] know that, you know, you don't. You're just traveling through and we could get her done for you. Okay, well, cool. Okay, I will. I'll let him know. And thanks. Thanks for looking into those sheets. And as I'm looking on their supply like site, they got all kinds of stuff. Yeah, yeah, they have all like specific, you know, to the camp for the [ORGANIZATION]. Well, that's cool. Yeah. Well, you've got a. The elite of travel trailers. I know that. I know. I am super excited. It's gonna be super fun. Yeah. Do you have any kids? We do. We have a [PERSON_AGE] [DURATION] old and [PERSON_AGE] [DURATION] old. So we're. Yeah, we're just, we're gonna just take it, kind of keep it close to home here in [LOCATION] and I don't know, like we've got, you know, our, you know, got our [ORGANIZATION] and then there's, you know, it's good to, you know, do your, do your truck camping too, you know, and do your backpacking. You got to do all your, all your different kinds of camping. My little [PERSON_AGE] [DURATION] old, we went up to [PERSON_NAME] down in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] down in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and he, he wanted to bring the new trailer And I don't think, you know, [PERSON_NAME] could have got it, you know, just the size of it, you know, to wear the. The camp is located in [LOCATION]. Oh, yeah, right. But I said. Yeah, I said, [PERSON_NAME], you know, you're a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], honey. You know, you. You gotta go stay in the cabin. That's what you do when your cup. Your [ORGANIZATION] better in the cabin. Well, I don't want him to get too small. I don't want him to get too. Too pampered. He's only gotta have all different kinds of experiences. Yeah. Pretty soon you'll know he'll be out hunting in it with all his buddies. Well, you know, [ORGANIZATION], that's good for, you know, for mommy, but, you know, Mommy has done plenty of, you know, sleeping in the truck and on the ground and all of that. The kids have to learn how to do that and enjoy that. Doors that way too, because. Exactly. All right, well, thank you so much. All right, [PERSON_NAME], appreciate your call. Okay, bye. Bye.

"Great day here. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I assist you? Could I speak to a [OCCUPATION] please? How can I help you today, sir? Okay, I'm getting ready to buy a vehicle. I don't want a new one. Well, I do want one, but I prefer a used vehicle. And my question is, do you have a. Or [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION]? What is it called? A palace. Dia. Palace. Dia. Palisade. Yeah. Do you, do you have them back? I mean, let me check if I have any for you. And what is your name, sir? [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How are they? Are they pretty? Do they. You know, I've always bought [NATIONALITY] cars. You know, Chevy and Fords and stuff like that. When I take it back, I bought a Volkswagen and I think it's a [DATE_INTERVAL] or [DATE_INTERVAL], something like that. And my, my son still drives it and I've never bought a [ORGANIZATION]. Well, lucky for you, I only own [ORGANIZATION] and I love them so. I mean I think they're pretty great cars. Are they? I mean I've never. I don't know and I don't even know anybody that has one. I really don't really, I don't know anybody. Every the people I know, they have the [NATIONALITY] models and they have the [NATIONALITY] and they have the [NATIONALITY], but I mean, you know, like the Toyotas and Hondas, but yeah, I don't know anybody's got a [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, well I do have like all my vehicles have been [ORGANIZATION] and I really don't have any complaints. I do have a Palisade right now and it's my favorite car. I even told my [MARITAL_STATUS] that I think I'm gonna keep it and just pay it off. But I do have some pre owned ones that have a [DATE_INTERVAL] that's actually still certified. It only has 19,000 miles. Wow. And I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] that has 36,000 miles. Okay. And there are trim levels on those. Yes Sir. So the [DATE_INTERVAL] with 19,000 miles is an selection. Then I have the [DATE_INTERVAL] is also an SEL. I do have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Limited which has more options and features. It has 50,000 miles. And then I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Calligraphy which is the top of the line one. It has 53,000 miles. Okay. I still have a few. Okay. And what do they go for? Like the first one you told me, the one that had the lesser miles. What, what does that one? That one is only at 36,296. Wow. 36. And, and like for that particular vehicle, does it have like display on the windshield? Does it have that. No. So you would be looking at the calligraphy, which. I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] calligraphy that has the heads up display. Oh, that's. Yes, right. That's what they call it, heads up. And does it have like that 360 camera where you can see everything? The calligraphy's gonna have that as well. And how about if there's a car in front of you and it, it kind of tells you there's something. Okay. Like, okay for that particular car that, that used. What. What do you ask? For that particular car. This one's at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And does it have [DATE_INTERVAL], 21 and does it still have warranty on it? This one is actually still [ORGANIZATION] certified. What does that mean? So if you, it means you pretty much get the warranty as this as a new vehicle. Pretty much, yeah. But let's say for another [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] or what? I don't. You see, when I buy something, I, I want to kind of. You see, I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] pickup. But the reason I'm looking for that, I owe [MONEY_AMOUNT] on it. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And I have people from out of town to come and they want to see [LOCATION] [LOCATION] and I gotta use their car. I hate that. You know what I mean? I can't take them in my pickup because it's only, you know, it's a two door. Yeah. And I love my truck. I love it, I love it. You know, but you know, and you know, I got. [ORGANIZATION] gonna retire. We want to go to [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION] and. Oh yeah. And you know, we got, I got a friend, she's got a friend and I can't take them in my truck, so. Yes, sir. So I'm looking for something. Okay, well, like I said, when I finish my truck paying, I'm gonna try to finish payment sometime this [DURATION]. I'm gonna double up on the payments and maybe I'll be going go check it out. How's the ride? The ride's good. Is it real? Yes. I, I love it. I mean we take our Palisade whenever we go on any trips like to [LOCATION] or to the casino and [LOCATION] [LOCATION] or. Yeah, we take, we take the Palisade everywhere. Okay. Were you gonna trade your truck in or were you gonna try to buy a different one? I'm gonna keep it. I'm gonna keep it because I figure if I need some to pick up something, you know, I got my truck. Okay. You know, you know like a refrigerator or something. I got my truck, you know. Okay, well, why don't you do this and, and, and, you know, like I said, I'm gonna go look at them, but I want to go pay the truck first. Why don't you send me take a picture of your. Of your business card and just send it to me, and then when I'm ready, I know who to talk to. How's that? Okay, I'll send that right out to you. I'm sorry. This. And I'll send that right out to you. And this is a good phone number here. Yes, ma' am. That's me. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, Mr. [PERSON_NAME]. And I'll go ahead and send that right out to you.

"Thank you for holding. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Hey [PERSON_NAME]. Hey. Wanted to inquire about the [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Y model you had for sale. In black of course. Yeah, I can confirm if we still have that one. And who am I speaking with? My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Give me one sec. I'm just trying to see right here if that one's still available. Were you looking to come by and take a look at it today? If it is? Quite possibly. I mean I just, I kind of wanted to really talk a little bit about the price because I know there's not going to be any rebate on it. It's [DURATION] [DURATION] old and [MONEY_AMOUNT] miles on it versus getting a brand new one. I'm trying to figure out. I mean what does for me. Yeah, what's nice about our system is it'll actually show what were ranked against other similar ones in the area. And it looks like within a 250 mile radius I was actually the best priced one out of 40. You know we try to put our best at four with our online pricing, of course, how competitive the market is. But yeah, looks like this one's actually one of the best deals out there. Yeah, I hear you. But if I were to go out and get a fried new one, a performance of 54,000, 54,000 let's just say. Right. And then I'm going to be getting. You said how much? Sir, I'm looking at [ORGANIZATION] right now pricing it out brand new [DATE_INTERVAL] model Y performance at [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, I mean shoot. This one right here, I mean it may have different features than the one you're thinking of because the window sticker on this one is actually $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that must be for a different model or less features. No, no, I agree. When they bought it in [DATE_INTERVAL] the prices have come down quite a again. I mean the performance is a performance. Right. It's a, it's, it's a model. Right. So and with the five, with the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] credit, I mean it brings it way lower than a used one mileage. Yeah, well I thought you said that you could buy a brand new one in the [DATE_INTERVAL] because like I said, I'm looking at the window sticker of this one and yeah, the window sticker, the base price is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] on this one that you're acquiring on. Yeah, yeah. Must have different features than the one of the brand new one you're looking at. Well, it's a. Why. Right. And I Looked at what I'm getting on yours, and it's. It's practically the same thing. And it's a brand new model. Have you. Have you tried website? Because the performance comes. Yeah, 100%. Yeah, yeah. And you can build them out so many different ways as well. But, yeah, I mean, you know, the. This one's a [DATE_INTERVAL] model. So if you're looking at a [DATE_INTERVAL], I mean, that MSRP on the window sticker, if it's the exact same features didn't change, you know, 10 to $[MONEY_AMOUNT], whatever, they dropped in price, number one. And then I'm considering the rebate. Right. Because when you buy a used car, you're not getting the tax credit of [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, no, I got you. Yeah. So it makes better sense to get [PERSON_NAME] when I was just trying to figure out. Yeah, I understand your pricing and all that. And when a [DATE_INTERVAL] was out there, it was priced a little higher. Things have changed. So they're down a little bit for a brand new one. So I was wondering what kind of negotiations I was looking to get about. Yeah, this one's a [DATE_INTERVAL] model. Yeah. And after all rebates, I mean, I can get a [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL] brand new. Zero miles, one owner. Zero owner. Really? I'd be the first owner for. Yeah, I gotcha. And again, you know, it have different features and. Or, you know, less than. Because like I said, you know, this one was built out to 71,000. Yeah. But I'm saying I'm looking at the features on it, and 90% of the features are standard features or performance model. Yeah, I got you. Yeah. I'm just trying to comment on. It's got to be apples, oranges. If the, you know, suggested retail price on that new one that you've built out or looking at is a, you know, 10 to $[MONEY_AMOUNT] difference in price. There's not a 10, $[MONEY_AMOUNT] difference in price based on yours versus when you go with the performance model, it automatically gives you everything except for the lane, the full driving, autonomous driving, which this one doesn't have. Gotcha. I guess. You know, what were you thinking as far as where, you know, we could earn your business on this one. Yeah, I mean, here's [PERSON_NAME]. I'm just starting straight up the way I'm thinking. Right. Indeed. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] wants to last on what you're asking there. Or I can get your used one. I was looking in the ballpark around [MONEY_AMOUNT] to $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, I got you. You wouldn't Be able to find a 22y performance, you know, model in that price range. Yeah, I got you, I got you. I mean it seems probably more feasible to get a brand new one because I do understand the color being black. It isn't up upgrade. So that's like [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] that they put into it in addition, you know. Yeah, I'm looking at all the features. Pretty much. It has everything except for the color. If you get a white, you can get it cheaper. But I appreciate it, man. I mean, if you. Yeah, if you'd like, I can actually send you the window sticker of this one. I mean, and show you that. Yeah, this one, brand new with all the features it has, you know, was just under $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. Would that be helpful by texting the window sticker? I mean, you could text it to me, but I think it still boils on to the same thing when I'm looking at it. Right. The only Difference is at [MONEY_AMOUNT], full self driving would be the difference. And you don't even have that from what I'm looking at because it would seem. Yeah. Did you, you know, want to come take a look at ours? Just, I guess because I know with [ORGANIZATION], you know, when you build them out, it could take, you know, upwards of [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] for your order to come in. I mean, would you like to at least come take a look at ours and see if it's what you're looking for? What's your, what's your humble opinion on price? I think ours, I mean, you know, we'll have no trouble selling it if we're the best price one within 250 miles. I mean, you know, my opinion is, you know, you called for the right one because it's the best priced one out there. All right. Because it was 200 stuff on, on your. So I'm kind of in. Yeah. Such a short period of time. [DATE_INTERVAL] in [DURATION] [DURATION]. Basically you had 200 already. I mean. No, that's not the case. It's actually been one owner showing us as the second owner. The second owner, [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah. It's a one owner vehicle. Absolutely. Yeah. That [OCCUPATION]. I agree with you on that one. So you don't think you'll do any lower? I mean, I'll let you know this, if you come out and take a look at it. I'll do everything I can to get some flexibility from my [OCCUPATION] on the price. But I mean, just to be transparent with you, I mean, you know, I don't, you know, I mean, you can, you would imagine this makes sense, you know how would it be able to discount the car to [MONEY_AMOUNT] when we're already the best priced one out there? You know what I mean? It doesn't make any sense. Yeah, well, I think. I think I'll. I have to think about some more because I mean realistically like I said, I'm positive I can get a brand new zero miles for that. Yeah, for the same price or less. Really after all the rebate. Just. Just help you understand as well those rebates, I mean you file on your taxes so I mean you won't see that rebate for almost [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah, you're. That's true but I gotta find out. But I think someone told me how pretty soon next [DURATION] [DURATION] are going to just take it off the top for some reason. Some kind of loophole that they can do that. I don't know. But yeah, you're right. I won't sweet till these till another year but. Gotcha. I'll just text it over to you just so you got some insight. Okay, you got it. The text message I'm going to send you, it's going to look like it's automated but if you just reply Y, E S that will allow us to reply back and forth. And how do you spell your first name? You kind of cut out there. It's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. You said [PERSON_NAME]. I'll fix it over you right now.

"[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. Are you in [OCCUPATION] or are you just like the [OCCUPATION]? I'm in [OCCUPATION]. Oh, awesome. I'm just calling in to give you some info. I'm looking to work on something slowly. It's going to go most likely one way instead of the other. It's going to be a card that my parents have most likely trying to get them out of besides losing on it. But before that, what? Because [DATE_INTERVAL] like going to be over by the time I'm ready to do something. I'm not looking to rush though, so you have that, you know, up front. We can stay in touch up until, you know, we get everything done. I'll bring them in with me. We're looking to get out of this. It's the [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] Trax. Miles are low. We've had it since it was new. There's a remaining balance on it of roughly high 12. Maybe I can give you the VIN. You can see where it sits at and we can keep in touch from there. Wherever we get is going to be like a [DURATION] [DURATION] lease because I know two is kind of hard nowadays. I'm sorry, people are turning completely the wrong way on this street. My apologies. She literally came the wrong way. But it's a [MEDICAL_CONDITION] sticker, Equinox or a Blazer, because I'm most likely going to be using it, you know, to run the errands and stuff. So nothing too fancy at all. The credit score for my mom's going to be in the mid-700s with no debt. So the lease is going to go into her name because I have other things that I'm running that I can't tie up my credit to right now. So what I'll do is if you want to create like a new thread, like a sms, text me with your name. I'll reply back, I know where you guys are located. I've actually been there delivering some vehicles for you guys a while while back. What's cheaper? Like the Equinox LTS or the [ORGANIZATION]. What do you guys usually have? Like, it all just depends because every [DURATION] they change, you know, the rates and then the rebate and incentives. So every [DURATION] it changes. I mean, there's been months where one's definitely been better than the other, so. Correct, I agree. Yeah, yeah. It just goes by that [DURATION] current programs. This [DURATION], [ORGANIZATION] are leasing out better than the [ORGANIZATION]. But like I said, I mean, just depending on what you qualify for and you know, what specific one you pick out because there's so many different options on them. I mean I would say [MONEY_AMOUNT] to 4/ [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Got you. So for example, for a [DURATION] [DURATION], I have [ORGANIZATION] employee from a family member. I can get it. It's not in my hands right now. I can get the [ORGANIZATION] number. Let's say. I'm not going to say we're going to lose or again on this. Let's say we broke even on this. For example, with 0 down, good credit, [DURATION] [DURATION], 12,000 miles there, the [ORGANIZATION] discount LT remote start, front wheel drive. What do you think will put us at for [DURATION] [DURATION]? High 30s to mid-400s if I had to guess. Gotcha. Okay. And that's just basic. Basic off of what I'm giving you basically, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Are you. You guys are pretty high volume there. You guys do quite a bit, right? Oh yeah, we're one of the largest [ORGANIZATION] dealerships. Yeah, I remember that. Just been about [DURATION] [DURATION] when I. You guys are in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I'm in this household area near [LOCATION]. Here's what we'll do. Are you, you guys. Because the [ORGANIZATION] tractors, did they stop making them? They're still making them, but they did a whole body revamp on them so they look completely different now. Oh, okay. Got you. So you think it'd be pretty doable if we guys gave this to you guys? We traded this basically and be pretty easy if we could just whatever we can gain something out of this to keep our other payment more done. That'd be pretty positive because I had dealerships reach out to me [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, all the way up to, you know, like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, saying that we're willing to, you know, give you more than what you guys owe on it. So I don't know if these are still like [OCCUPATION] are looking to get these out of, you know, people's hands for them to, you know, upgrade or just like walk away and not have a car depending like for my parents, they don't need it, but I need one for them because they can't get into it. So what do you think? I'm actually, you know what, I'm in the car wash right now. When I pull out, do you want me to give you the VIN number and we can work out that way slowly. So I could also know what to expect to them because you're going to want a lot of information to make it easier on you. And for myself I'll do my part. So I am just exiting out of the Car wash. If you want to get ready, I will read out the VIN number to you. And whenever you feel like reaching back with time, I know you have bills and stuff going on, reach out and let me know. I'll log into [ORGANIZATION] and I'll find out. But it's going to show you guys, so I know you guys have access to that. Let me just pull in these [LOCATION] [LOCATION] here and I'll read you out the VIN number. It's not a big deal. If you'd like, I can send you it. I can send you a text message. And that way when you're not driving, you can send me over the bin. Would that be easier for you? You want me to do that or. Yeah, the picture is gonna be kind of fuzzy. What do you prefer? Because I just actually pulled over. I could read it out to you if you would like. Sure, I can take it right now. Okay. Awesome. I'm pretty sure don't work. Oh, you're good. I think the easiest thing would be when do you think your parents would be ready to bring it in for an appraisal and to put some numbers together? Because everything changes so frequently so often. I think the most important thing is when you're ready, whenever that is, to reach out to me. And that way we can set something up to do an appraisal. We can run numbers and that way we're getting completely accurate up to the date or up to the moment. Pardon me? Information for them. Correct. Like that [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] time frame for that [DURATION]. We'll stay the same, basically, is what you're saying. What was that? I'm so sorry, the phone just cut out. No, you're fine. It's the area too. I said basically whatever the [DURATION] is. Like for example, we appraisal, for example, [DATE] [DATE]. We're good for that [DURATION] [DURATION] as well as, you know, the pricing and the interest rates and all that. All those numbers will be the same for the [DURATION], right? Just for the [DURATION] of [DATE_INTERVAL]. And then in June, everything, [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL], everything changes again. Yeah. So would I be dealing with you or are you. Do you work bidding somebody? Because I know sometimes I get transferred and it kind of throws me through a loop. Are you actually working directly with me? Yes, I'm a real [OCCUPATION]. Awesome. Thank you. Okay. You said [PERSON_NAME], right? Yes, [PERSON_NAME], thank you so much. Shoot me a text message. And what's your name, sir? I'm [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. What's your last name? Is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. All right, what's a good phone number for you, [PERSON_NAME]? Perfect. What I'm going to do, I'll send you that text message then, like I said, once you and your parents are ready to come in and we can do the appraisal and get all the information together, that'd be our best bet. And then that way they're going to have, you know, accurate current information and it'll be really simple to help them, you know, figure out what route they want to go. Yeah, because I know they don't really want to lose on this. They don't want to put anything out of pocket. So they do want whatever, you know, is. Because there was zero percent on this, and it's going to show up on you guys then, I'm pretty sure. So they kind of want something I just could put down for the other one because you're not going to be using the car as much. I'm going to be putting half of the miles on it before we return it back. So they kind of want, you know, like, something to work with them. And I'm basically holding their hands throughout all this because you're just, you know, you're [PERSON_AGE] [PERSON_AGE] and doing the best. So hopefully we can work out a deal between you guys, are happy and we're happy. You guys gain. We walk out with something, you know, for [DURATION] [DURATION], and I'll take it from there. I'll keep in touch with you. [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL], a little bit earlier. I'm not just gonna call and get information. I'd come back. I want to deal with you guys because the city over is too busy and I'd rather come out there. So I'll keep in touch with you and we'll do something. And I'll bring the current for appraisal and I will see what numbers we can crunch up. So everybody's happy. Thank you so much for your time, [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, absolutely. You have a good day, [PERSON_NAME], and I'll thank you so much. Okay, thank you. I'll reply back. Bye. Bye.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. It's [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Yes, hi, so I'm looking at a white G Gladiator, high altitude that you guys have. I'm looking at up on cargoes. I just want to know if you guys got it in stock. Give me one second. What's the stock number? Stock number is [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. I've had it here. I still have it in [EMAIL_ADDRESS] by [EMAIL_ADDRESS] white. Okay, and then also. Yes, G Gladiator. Yep. And then, so I'm looking here on [ORGANIZATION] and it says that you guys do that. You guys can deliver. We, we hire through a company, it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. We don't deliver, it's done through a third party that can. Okay, and. Okay, and then that third party, do they have any sort of insurance in case like the car gets destroyed or something during. Yeah, that's because we wouldn't use any companies that don't have the transportation insurance. That's why we can't do it directly. And that's why we use third parties because of that same reason. Okay, in the event that something like that does happen during shipment, who is the one that's supposed to like talk to them like you guys or I do? Something like half that happened in the shipment, it would be on you because it. Once we release it to them, it's on them. Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. All right. And another thing too, so on here I was looking that you guys actually had it for sale for [MONEY_AMOUNT] on [DATE] [DATE], is that correct? Let's see. [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, I'm just bringing up the. Hold on, let me see. New car, [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. Where's my Jeeps? There we go. Gladiator. Let me see. Why did they have it go so far out? 10 miles? Okay, seeing if it's this one. Hold on. Okay. 527032. No, it's five two, six. It's a different one. So we just got a light one that does not even allow me to filter them out. Easy, because we got a lot of dealerships around here, so brings up a lot of different things. Of course. Overland. Overland. Why isn't this showing? What price are you showing it for? Well, it says it's showing. Hold on, let me look at again because I kind of lost the place. All right, all right. It says [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It says [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE] [DATE], which was literally [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. Because I don't show it on our. The website. Any on [ORGANIZATION] anymore? I can't find it on Cargus anymore. Just give me a second. Okay. It's because if you're actually on [ORGANIZATION], you have to go to PRI, where it says price decreased or something like that. And then it says show price history. Yeah, but I can do it because. So I'm showing right now the one. The same stock are L 52732. Our Internet price right now is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes, that's why I definitely see there. But let's see. Because. Because I'm just trying to figure out why the price, you know, changed in like [DURATION] [DURATION]. Because [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's if that's the case. We just. Because we had a sale last week and we just raised our prices on Friday. And that would have reflected on the [DATE] on CarGurus because it's [DURATION] [DURATION] behind. Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, because that was the case I would have bought. Yeah. Where do you look? Where do you live at? I actually live over here. No, I'm in [LOCATION]. Yeah, because there's. Okay, let me get you with a [OCCUPATION]. Just bear with me one moment. I'm in my [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], so just bear with me one moment. Because there may. You know, there's different things. You know, we negotiate and stuff like that. So just bear with me. I'm gonna put you on a brief silence hold, okay? You'll probably hear music or whatever, but I'm just gonna put you on hold for a second. Okay? And your first name? First name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. Just give me a second, okay? Okay, sounds good. [PERSON_NAME]. Hello? Good afternoon. Thanks for calling. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, hi. So I was calling in about a white [ORGANIZATION] gladiator, high altitude. That vehicle is currently available, sir. Are you planning on coming to see it? How can we assist you? Oh, no, no, I can't. I can't see it. You guys are too far. But what I was asking about was. So I'm browsing here in cars, and it says that it's a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] delivery to [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Which is fine. Let's see. And then I know the vehicle is priced at [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And I saw in here that it was recently, like [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, on sale for [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Because I saw that price because right now I'm shopping two other white. White, high altitudes, but they're. They're certified Pre owned with 2000 miles and it's literally more expensive than that price. So I was like, well, that's the case, I might as well buy brand new from you guys, you know. Okay, the vehicle is here, sir. Tell me what we need to do to run your business. Okay, let's see. So since this is a price from [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, is that still something we can do? No, sir, because what that means is we. What it means is we had extra incentives on that car. And if you're aware, we do advertise with qualifying incentives. So let me just ask you a few questions to see if you qualify for any of those. Are you military? Yes. You're military? Yes. Okay, so all you have to do, sir, once we so included in this price, there's a military incentive. We also [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] in there. So if you qualify for any of those, you just got to go on the line, [URL] [URL]. And there's a form there, they're going to ask you a few question, you fill it out and it will send you a code. All you have to do is send me the code. That's it. So whatever you qualify for, say it again. So real quick. So then this price right now at [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT], is that including both the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and the military. So technically, yes, it's higher. Yeah, it includes. But again, let me ask you, if I can do this price online, can we move forward even if you don't qualify for anything? Which one? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yes. And what if I qualify? Then I still get. I still get nothing that's the same. I'm not sure, sir. I have to go to the desk. So you tell me if you qualify or down and I will go to the desk and I will present it for you. If they say no, I'll let you know. If they say yes, I'll let you know. If we make a deal, you get the vehicle. If we don't, you have our contact, I have yours, and we move forward. We said okay. We tried. Okay, can you send me the. Can I give him my email? So you can send me a breakdown then of what your [OCCUPATION] would say. I am going to need more than that, sir, so. Because again, I'm going to look for all qualifying rebates. So I'm going to need an address and I'm going to need your full name and your zip code. Okay. It's. Yeah. Okay, it's [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]. Yeah. [LOCATION]. Huh? No, [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay. [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. And then it's [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. What's the zip code? [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]. I'm missing one. You faded the [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. It's [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Okay, so for two. Yeah. Okay. And you said you're military. What's branch? [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. I have a lot of [ORGANIZATION] friend. My. My friend, I used to work for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] for [DURATION] [DURATION]. Oh. I was civil and I worked in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] there. I was down there maybe [DURATION] [DURATION] ago down in [LOCATION]. So I went down by the exchange close by to meet some of my friends that work in the exchange. So. Yeah. But I did accounting for the [ORGANIZATION] for the exchange for [DURATION] [DURATION]. I was in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. So I have a ton of military friends. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. What's your first name? Okay. First name is [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. What's your last name?

All right, my friend, let me see what I can do for you and then we move forward. And what's the email? Email is my last or [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. No. Okay, so let me sort of. So it's my last name and then [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Zero now. All right. Let me go to work for you, and I will send you a work quote and we go from there. Sound fair? Yes.

"Thank you for calling me. [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], can I talk to somebody in [OCCUPATION], please? Yep, I'm in [OCCUPATION]. How can I help? Oh, are you. Oh, great. I don't want to use up. I don't want to use up too much of your time because I know, you know, time is money. And I sold cars and I sold Volvos and. Oh, wow, very cool. I worked at. I worked at a dealership down here in [LOCATION]. I live in [LOCATION], and I worked at a dealership that we sold [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. You know what? You just described my life. Those are the two dealerships I've worked for. [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. We have a lot in common. Although I don't live in [LOCATION], I might be a little jealous. The one in [LOCATION] used to be owned by [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], and he owned it for [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION], and another group bought it. But anyway, so I'm really familiar with the product, and I'm on my. Right now. I'm currently on my fourth lease of my [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. And so I'm going into, like, [DURATION] [DURATION], I think. Three times. Three times four. Yeah, [DURATION] [DURATION]. I got about [DURATION]. [DURATION] [DURATION] left on. I mean, [DURATION] [DURATION] left on my current [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. And I. What I do is I just keep turning them in and flipping them and just getting a new one and. And, you know, I'm thinking. I'm thinking I'm ready for a change. And our local dealership down here is having it. The new owner, and they have really low inventory. And I used to live up in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION], and I used to sell four. I used to sell [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]. Oh, way back. Way back when. Yeah. I'm an old guy anyway. Right. Right when. Right when that auto center opened. Anyway, so I'm familiar. So I'm kind of. I'm just playing around on my phone and looking around because I. I'm [DURATION] [DURATION] away. I need to start doing a little research and thinking an XD60 is. You know, I like the [ORGANIZATION] product. I mean, I sold a lot of them, and they're. You know, there's so many great benefits of. Of that product. And I'm an SUV guy. So the SD60, and I've always liked the combination of the denim blue with a blonde interior, which you have on your website that I was just checking out, and you have it discounted down with a couple discounts at [MONEY_AMOUNT] or something like that. And I know that they changed. Have you been Selling [ORGANIZATION] for a while. So here's my funny story. I worked with [ORGANIZATION] for about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. I left during [MEDICAL_CONDITION] and went to [ORGANIZATION] for about [DURATION] [DURATION]. And I am now in my third month back at [ORGANIZATION]. So I am very familiar with. With [ORGANIZATION] as a whole. But some of the newer cars, obviously they've changed up the trims on us and the engines, but I learned quickly. So if you had any specific questions, I could probably still help you. Yeah, that's where I'm a little. Because I haven't done a whole lot of research. But I was real familiar with the trims and the nameplates of the trims and now they changed. It's like a B3 now or something instead of a. It used to be different. The T5 and T6 and T8. Yeah, essentially they're all now mild hybrids or plug in hybrids. So if you see the B5, that essentially kind of translates to the former T5 where you get about 250 horsepower. And the B6 would kind of equate to the former T6, so you get about 300 horsepower. And then of course the plug in hybrids now are referred to as recharge, as opposed to the T8. And then the true line core would be your entry level, which was before the momentum. Plus isn't exactly an equation to our design because there isn't really a sports package unless you get the dark trim. But plus would be the mid level and then ultimate is the higher end trim, more of what the inscription was. So if you think of the ultimate, having a leather dash, the heads up display, the heated and cooled seats, more bells and whistles on the ultimate. And then they let you choose between bright or dark. And that refers to your front grille and accents around the windows. Right, right, right, right. Okay. So that now it's all coming back to me now and how I kind of fell into the. It was back in the [DATE_INTERVAL] when I was selling the [ORGANIZATION], but I kind of fell into selling [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] in the same. On the same lot. They kept them separate, separate size of the building because [ORGANIZATION]. So [ORGANIZATION] is so regulatory, they don't want any other vehicles mixing with their vehicle. So we had to keep them on opposite sides of the lot. Anyway, but. Anyway. But yeah, so that bringing back the memories. So I fell into it during. Before [MEDICAL_CONDITION] because the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], I was in there for service, dropped my car off and the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] knew me, knows me real well and he asked me good, you know, Our car. So. Well, and you're in [OCCUPATION] because I am in [OCCUPATION] in a different industry, but. And he goes. He goes, you know, are you interested? We need some guys. And I go, well, I can kind of do it part time for you. All right. You know, if I could work my other job from my office when it's slow. And so, yeah, that's how I kind of fell into it. And that's how I kind of just kept repeating into the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] thing. But I really like the [ORGANIZATION] product. And you just reminded me of the different levels. That inscription is pretty much what we. We carry. Mostly momentum and. Inscription. Yeah, mostly inscription. Because of the high level in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. You know, the. Looking for the higher price point. The higher price point. Yeah. So what I caught was the B3. So they're all like mild hybrids now, but the B3 and the. You said B3. B6. B5. B6. So [DURATION] as in. Yeah, yeah. And B6. And so going up into the B6, is that a six cylinder or are they still four cylinders? No, [ORGANIZATION] only makes all four cylinder vehicles. That's right. That's right. That's. Yeah. Okay. All right. But they do have the turbo. Okay. And if you've got a bunch of people, you know, if you got people on your lot and you need to drop me, that's okay because. Because I'm. I'm doing little research now. And if you've got people walking in on a Saturday, I don't want to keep you from a sale, so. Well, I do have an appointment that's supposed to be here around [TIME], so, you know, she may show up early or may show up late. Never know. But I'd like to get your name and number though. That way in case I do have to. I can give you a call or text back. Yeah. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, perfect. And then your last name. My numbers. My last name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] Difficult. Okay. That's why I didn't even know. But anyway, anyway, so. So yeah, so that's what. And I'm kind of. I've been into leasing lately, you know, for the last [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] now, because I don't have to worry about anything. And then I can always option into just purchasing it outright at the end. At the end of the lease. I don't think I want to purchase this one outright. I have considered previous ones that I had to purchase outright, but I just rolled it up. I Just rolled right into a new lease. But anyway, yeah, so I. But I understand because I. The [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] at our local dealership and they have their little light on inventory, but I've been in touch with them recently because my lease is coming up and I've been talking with them and he says the [ORGANIZATION] leasing program is starting to look a little better. But it was really bad there for a while. The money factor was putting it up at around 8, 9% interest rate. You know, your incentives and lease programs, everything changes month to month and it is dependent on what exact not only model, but also which trim you're considering. So that obviously with the money factor equates to interest rates, which we all know interest rates have gone up, so I wouldn't know offhand exactly where they're at right now. They do appear to be a bit better, but to what extent? Yeah, it's hard to say. The [ORGANIZATION] are horrible right now. They're like nine. The money factor cranks it up to like over 9% interest rates. Hold on one second. But he said that the [ORGANIZATION] is getting a little better. And I know I have time, but I might as well start doing a little bit of research. Sure. Yeah. That way you can hopefully find the right car. Exactly. And especially since I saw that denim blue with blonde interior, I sold a bunch of that color combination, which I like. Beautiful. I think it's. I think the classy look. I also kind of like the pearl white. I had a pearl white Harley, but. Oh, sure. But yeah, I think that I would like the. The pearl. I mean the, the denim blue with the blonde interior. Blonde interior, yeah. And the one that is on your website. I don't. I'm not on your website. I'm on my phone right now. I could probably go to it and give you the stuff. You probably have it right in front of you. But anyway, you mentioned something that it was showing about [MONEY_AMOUNT] after incentives were imp. Applied. We do have two kind of in that price point. One is currently in our. Actually they're both in our loaner fleet. So I'm sure you're aware of being in the car business, when people bring cars in for service, we provide loaner vehicles for them to drive around in. So these vehicles are technically for sale. They're in our fleet. They just may be loaned out at the moment and we would have to pull it out. And many times because they have such low mileage, they would still be leasable. Yeah, well, because you can certify them. You can certify them. And turn them into leasable vehicles. Certify we would not be. We would not be able to apply the new car incentives, or they would not be leasable if. If we certify the car. But yes, if you choose not to lease or apply the new car incentives, then I don't believe we would certify it. Does that make sense? Right, right, right, right. Yeah. Both. Both. Both that I'm. Both. The cars you have in stock in that combination are. They're both loaners in that price point. I do have a few other denim with blonde. They're just a little bit higher. Let's see. Those are dark and cheery. I thought I saw one more. Yes. So I've got a B6 Ultimate Bright. That's denim blue with blonde. And that One has an MSRP of [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That I have a B5 Ultimate Bright with an MSRP of [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Okay. Well, now let's talk a little bit about my. The. The. The challenge that we're going to have. Again, I still have [DURATION] [DURATION]. I have until [DATE_INTERVAL]. Is that [DURATION] [DURATION]. Something like that sounds good. Yeah, something like that. [DURATION] [DURATION]. Anyway, so my challenge is. Is during [MEDICAL_CONDITION] you know, everybody had a hit. Everybody took a hit somehow, and I took a hit, and I. All the way through [DATE_INTERVAL], the. The worst year where it was sequestered and everything shut down. I luckily had. I had the means to be able to. All my payments today for the entire year of [DATE_INTERVAL]. And then [DATE_INTERVAL], I started. Yeah, in [DATE_INTERVAL], I started calling around and calling my. My credit card companies. And basically that's. That's. That is my problem is. Okay, I took care. I. I kept everything up to date, always. I didn't have. In [DURATION] [DURATION], I've never, ever missed a car payment. I always pay early, but my credit cards, I called the companies and I said, hey, you know, [MEDICAL_CONDITION], I. I kept it all the way through [DATE_INTERVAL]. Here we are in [DATE_INTERVAL], and I'm trying to stay on board, but can you work with me? And some of them just said, no, we won't work with you. So my bottom line is my score won't weigh down, and I don't know what it is. I haven't run hard yet, and I'm kind of a little scared to, you know, you get the, you know, from your bank. And I got a 401k and I've also got a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] account, but in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] account, and they always send me hey, check your credit score. And it ranges right around [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. I used to have an [NUMBER_SEQUENCE], [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] or something. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Yeah, like that. And now I'm at [MONEY_AMOUNT] because of these, these people that wouldn't. These credit cards that wouldn't work with me. And so I've got. I've got a little bit of a credit score issue, which might be a challenge to getting me into a. Getting me into a lease. But if you look at my, my car payment right, typically use [ORGANIZATION], and they use, obviously your auto [ORGANIZATION], I think number eight. So if you've got a good credit history based on your auto lo that your credit score may improve. Obviously, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] would be ultimately the decider if they would approve you for the lease. But if you've got good, [MONEY_AMOUNT] is kind of right on that border. Typically I say if you've got [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], you're good to go. If you're in the [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT] range, it's a little more up in the air. But we've gotten people approved with that score, so I wouldn't want you to be discouraged. [ORGANIZATION] may also just ask for a little bit more money down. It's hard to say. Once you put everything together on a specific car, that's when we would have our answers. But I don't want you to be discouraged. I've gotten people approved on leases with a score in the 600s before. Are you still there, [PERSON_NAME]? I may have lost you. Hello? I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I cannot hear you. I might hang up here until I give you a call back or a text.",failure,feature_question,XD60,medium,False,115477f1d574462cbef7de4920218751_transcript.json

"How do you tell myself. [PERSON_NAME] Speaking. I may help you. Yes, I'm calling in reference to one of the pre owned. A6 model. I have a stack number with me. I hope you question what color is it? Just tell me which car it is. The color is. Our exterior color is white. Hold on. A six. No, sorry. Black experiment. Black interior. Black and Black. All right. [DATE_INTERVAL] model. 16,000 miles. Yes, that's correct. 16,000 miles, that's correct. Yeah, that's Vesuvius gray which is like a really really dark gray. But it looks. Hang on the phone while confirmed availability. Okay, what are you talking about, [PERSON_NAME]? I know, but I need to qualify. Huh? Nothing. You should clarify what car it is before you. Yeah, probably nothing because. Well, Yep. Yeah, the car's available. So. Yeah. Is this car was a. Your kind of a demo car or any service car? What type of car was that? Because it doesn't look like it's. It was a service loaner. It was owned by us. Okay, so it was owned by you. Right, so. And what mainly generally is those car type of car used for? Like you know, generally. What are you used for? Have you brought your car to service and got a car for the day and then brought it back? Yeah, that's true. I mean something I have like for example, if I drop off my car for service or something like that and they give me the car, it's only used. It's only used to be loaned out to service customers that need a vehicle. Okay. And it will still have a. What do you call the factory warranty and everything? Well, it doesn't have a full factory warranty. It has [DURATION] [DURATION] or 33,000 miles left. Okay. So I think it's not the one which has your [DATE_INTERVAL] 30, it's a [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL], a 6 3.0. Looks like black on black, but it has 16,000 miles. We're talking about the right car. I don't understand why a pre owned car would have a full warranty. Now what I mean. Yeah, I think I know because I think you're right because because of [DATE_INTERVAL] you don't generally offer that thing as a recertified. Because it already has a factory warranty left. That's right. Because sometimes you know, they do offer. The extended car was certified. It would be advertised as certified. Okay. So it is not. Which is the certification adds. It adds a [DURATION] [DURATION] 50,000 miles. Right. So that would give you like you know, practically [DURATION] [DURATION] or a hundred thousand miles. So if you want that certification, you can do that. It's an additional cost of [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Understood. You know, I'll try to make a deal with you, but I'm not sure, you know, what do we have, you know, if you, you want to come in, look at the car, drive it. Yeah, no, I completely understand because this is for my daughter actually, and because I just, I'll try to make it, I'll try to make a deal with you. That's not a problem. Right, right, right. I think you guys are in a [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION], right? Yep. Why move for? Because I'm coming from [LOCATION] [LOCATION], so of course I have to first figure out everything looks good, then, you know, I can able to come over there because it is very far for me also. So, you know, of course, everything. I'm going to look at the car search reports and everything, but the way you said it, pretty much the [OCCUPATION] vehicle for your purpose only, internal purpose, so not going to be used by any permanent customer for longer duration. Going like that. Say the last part one more time. So I, I. Because you said generally most of the time you loan to the, your preferred customer for a shorter duration. I don't get it. So. Because what I'm, I'm, what I'm questioning is because it has a, this, a lot of miles in this shorter [DURATION]. So that's why it says car that's [DURATION], what, [DURATION] [DURATION] old was 16,000 miles. That means I was driven an average of what? Of 7,500 miles [DURATION] [DURATION]. How many miles [DURATION] [DURATION] you drive, right? You know, the average is 12,000 per [DURATION]. Yeah, no, I, I understand. Okay, let me look at it. And the way I says I have everything. Is this your cell phone number you call? Yeah, yeah, that's your number. What's your number? All right, I'll text you from my cell phone.

It was sent over by [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. It's a [DATE_INTERVAL] Titan. Okay, hold here. I believe they're dealing with my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [PERSON_NAME]. So I'll just put you on a quick hold for a moment here and she'll be able to can discuss what's going on for you. Give me one moment. First news answer is [PERSON_NAME] speaking. Hi, my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and I have a truck that's there that was sent over by [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] last week. And I'm just wondering if you have any information on. Yeah, so I gave them a call. I believe it was Thursday or Friday and we have to order a part for it and then we're just waiting. We had to get approval from them and now we're just waiting for the part to come in. It's about [DURATION] [DURATION] out and then we'll get it in for you. Okay, what is it that you had to order? Just give me one quick second. I assume they didn't call you. No, I've been dealing with [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] there. He's just a [OCCUPATION] and he's a super friendly guy and stuff. He just. I have to hound him to get anything out of him. But I didn't bother calling. I just didn't call them Thursday or Friday because I was in the city with my kids and stuff. Yeah. So we're ordering a bank to camshaft position sensor. So what happened is like the [OCCUPATION] moved the sensor to different banks and the code that the truck's presenting would jump like with it. So that's the starting point. From there we're hoping that that fixes it, but just with their like the codes that it's throwing, they're kind of all over the place. We have to kind of do process of elimination with it. So that's the first step. Hopefully that will fix it. But if not, then we've got it booked in and he'll dig into it further where the code keeps jumping. It's really hard to track it down. Okay. Yeah. But he did some tests and he found that this is probably the best place to start. So we got approval from them and I've got the part on order already. Okay. And you say it's probably [DURATION] [DURATION] out? It's about [DURATION] [DURATION] out. And then once it gets here, that's when we would book the appointment. Just because if the part is delayed then we've got to rearrange the schedule. And so. Yeah. Okay. All right. Because, like, I bought the truck [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, and I had it home maybe for, like, [DURATION] [DURATION] and brought it back to him. I haven't seen it since. Oh, yeah. That's frustrating. Yeah. Well, we've got it here. I guess if you have any questions, it might be easier for you to give me a call. Yeah, my Extension here is [TIME]. If I don't answer, just leave me a voicemail and I'll get back to you. Sometimes it's hard for me to get to the phone, but that's kind of where we're at right now with it. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Yep.

"Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. How can I direct your call? New sales for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. All right, one moment, please. Can I help you? Yeah, I need to talk to your [OCCUPATION]. Yeah, what's your name? My name's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, sir. How can I help you? Hey, this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I call in from [ORGANIZATION], and I bought my [MARITAL_STATUS] a new [ORGANIZATION] about [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. She's retiring in [DATE_INTERVAL], and I just can see what kind of trade in price I might be able to get just, you know, visiting with you over the phone. I got all the kind of information you need. Okay, so what's the good phone number for you? Hey, did you say your name was [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, and then which car was she trading in? We bought a. A brand new [DATE_INTERVAL] [ORGANIZATION] DX5 Touring. And, [PERSON_NAME], it wasn't a base model. I think it was one step above the base model because it has, you know, like the leather seat with the cloth inside the leather. Gotcha. Okay, so [DATE_INTERVAL] CX5 touring. And. Yeah. Okay, so I will. Because we're gonna do a site unseen, it's not going to be the most accurate, you know, appraisal, because you have to bring it in for the most accurate appraisal. But maybe we can give you, like a run, a rough estimate on it. Yeah, I understand that. I'm [DURATION] [DURATION] away from y' all, so. Are you in [LOCATION], [PERSON_NAME]? Yes, we are. Yeah. Yeah, I'm [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] away from you, but I've got all the information. She works [DURATION] [DURATION] away from where we live, so she drives about 100 miles a day. So it's got 40,000 miles on it. The color was that sole. Red crystal metallic. And when we bought it, it had five miles on it. We bought it from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. Gotcha. So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna send you a text message. And [PERSON_NAME], I'm [PERSON_AGE] years old and I'm old school. I don't do computer stuff or. I've still got a flip phone, so it'd be better. You can't really send me pictures or anything. I can't really get them. Okay. Yeah. Because if you wanted to do a sight unseen, I need pictures of the car, pictures of the odometer and all that. But it's gonna. If you want to make it easier for you, that then coming in would be the best. Would be the best. The best route to take. Well, if I thought we could get close to deal I would come in, but I'm just gonna. I'm giving you all the information you need over the phone right now. It's never been in a wreck. No hail damage, no dings, no dents. It's the. Okay, and then what's the exact odometer reading on it? Just. I think it just turned 40,000. I need the exact number. 40,100. [PERSON_NAME], I said I need the exact number, like down to every digit. Well, I mean, 40,100, that's the mileage on it. 40,140. Yeah, 40,100. You need the VIN number or anything? [PERSON_NAME]? Yeah, I'll need the VIN number as well. You ready? Yeah, go ahead. [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID] [VEHICLE_ID]. [VEHICLE_ID]. Gotcha. Okay, so have the VIN number. And you said it has been any wrecks, anything like that? No major dings, dents? No. No hail or anything like that. And it's the color. Was that sole? Red Crystal metallic. Sport utility. Body type. Sport utility. I gotcha. All right, so with the information you gave me, I'm gonna go talk to my [OCCUPATION] and see if. We'll see what we can do for your trade. Like I said, it's gonna be a rough estimate. Just because we haven't seen the car in person, we have no pictures, we don't have any. Anything for it. So I'm gonna see what I can do. Okay. Well, yeah, I mean, just let him know it's in excellent condition. You know, no dings or hail damage or anything like that. Because, I mean, it has to be. It's gonna have to be a good quote, you know, to get me to come in for [TIME], you know, for a [DURATION] [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION] trail. She's not retiring till [DATE_INTERVAL], but. So I didn't really want to get it to [DATE_INTERVAL], but I mean, if I got a good enough deal now, you know, I'd just go ahead and do it. Probably makes sense. Does it? I mean, I know you're giving me an estimate, but if I waited till [DATE_INTERVAL], it'd probably change some, wouldn't it? Yeah, it would. Just because of, you know, more miles on it. More. Yeah. More stuff could happen to it. Well, but to. At the same time too, I guess about [DATE_INTERVAL]. So y' all probably be getting a [DATE_INTERVAL]. So I would think you'd be. I mean, they're 24s, so I would think you'd be ready to, you know, try to get rid of the 23s, which, I mean, you are now. It depends. Whenever [ORGANIZATION] decides to release them. Yeah. Yeah. But, yeah, let me go talk to my [OCCUPATION] about that estimate on it and. Yeah, I'll get back to you. All righty. Thanks. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, sir? You got my number? I do? That's right. Yeah. Yeah.

I think tomorrow. My current car also needs to be evaluated. I just want to make sure that he still has the cars that I drove last week on the lot. They were. It was a black and a black and black car and it was a Miro hybrid. Okay, give me one moment. [PERSON_NAME], I'm going to transfer you to him to make sure that he can look that up for you. Okay? How's your [DURATION] going so far? You know what? I'm very grateful that I made this decision. Good. And I'm glad that we were able to accommodate you. So give me one moment. You guys were really sweet and I really appreciate that. There are some pretty rude people out there right now and I. Yeah, so it makes a difference when people are well mannered and polite. So thank you for that. Of course. Always. That's how everyone should be treated. Give me one moment and I'll transfer you to [PERSON_NAME]. Hello. Please state your name after the tone and [ORGANIZATION] Voice will try to connect you. Hi, [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME]. Hello, how you doing? Hey, [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME]. I'm good, thank you. How are you? I'm doing pretty good, [PERSON_NAME]. How you doing? Well, you already said you're doing pretty good, but. Yeah, Yeah, I. I think I'm gonna go for the black on black X. I think it's the middle trim for the. Okay. Yeah, I think it's not the base trim, but the middle. The middle trim. It'll be the EX Touring. The EX Touring, yeah. EX Touring. Okay. Yeah, I think that's what I wanted. That has the heated seats, right? Correct. Correct. Yes, I do want the heated seat in. If I went up the sx, what would be added to that? If you went up to the sx, so it would be added to the ventilated seats, which is cool to be heated. Steering wheel. You're going to have the front sensors in the car and also front sonars. Front sensor and sonar, you'll have the same. And you have. The leather will feel a little bit different as well. Okay. It looks like it's not real leather though. It's synthetic. Right. It'll still be the plant based synthetic leather just because it's recycled. Yeah. That's awesome. I'm so glad that they're doing that. That's really great. So I do need to get an estimate on my car. It has a book value of anywhere between [MONEY_AMOUNT] and $[MONEY_AMOUNT] and it's in pretty good shape. So I'd like to be able to trade that in if I could. Of course, of course. Now, are you available today or Wednesday? How late are you open today? So I'm here till about [TIME]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [TIME]? Yeah, I think it's going to be a little tight for me to get out today. I can come by tomorrow. So tomorrow I'm actually not here because I have a [OCCUPATION] appointment I've been planning for about [DURATION] [DURATION] now. What about, what about Wednesday? Sorry about that. Wednesday? I'm available [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah, let's do Wednesday. I think I have somebody that I'm seeing in the morning. So I'll probably be out there by, I don't know, [TIME], [TIME]. And it's okay for me to bring it? Bring it. I'm going to pay with two different checks. Both of them will be made out to. Both of them will be made up out to the dealership. But my mother is helping us out. So she's going to write a check from her [ORGANIZATION] account and give that to me. So she would write that out to try [ORGANIZATION]. Correct. So how would it work? Just because I know she's going to make. Are you going to. Are you paying cash to put them on the afternoon? Yeah, we're planning to pay cash. Okay. Okay. So how it's gonna work, Just so you know, So I would strongly recommend that you bring a bank check. Just because I know that you probably want to take delivery of the car that [DURATION]. Correct? Right. I can do that. So a certified bank check, that'll be okay. Can you provide? I think I can get you a bank check. That's not a problem. Her check is not a bank check though. It's. It's handwritten from her [ORGANIZATION] account. I don't know if they can do. They can do that. So that's going to be a problem. So again, if, if she can make the check out to you and then it go. It Processes that way only again. But, yeah, that's not gonna work. So. Okay. Yeah, I don't know how you would make a bank check out from [ORGANIZATION], because I don't know if they do that because they're not a bank. Right, right, right, right. So she's actually just writing a personal [ORGANIZATION] account, but from [ORGANIZATION]. From her [ORGANIZATION] account. Right. Okay. I'll have to ask my [OCCUPATION] how to go about that because this will be my first time actually. Actually doing that. But I'm pretty sure we can work around it. All right, let's. I can write a bank check for the difference. I can do that. That's not a problem. So we're looking at the car you showed me. Wasn't an ex, if I'm correct. Right. The car I showed you was. Wasn't ex. So black on black ex. Right. Correct. Okay, so just. Just give me a second. I'm just trying to pull up your profile as I'm speaking with you. So we're not going to be able to figure this out anyways, [PERSON_NAME], because you still have to look at my car and, you know, to trade that in, we're gonna. Yeah, I don't think. I don't think I can get. I mean, I can go to a bank in. You know, if my bank has. If my bank has an outlet in [LOCATION], I can do that when I'm out there on Wednesday. So I have a question just so I can kind of help you. So I can kind of help out with everything. Let me do this. Yeah. Can you give me your VIN number or send me. If I can text you, can you send me a copy of your. Your registration and then the exact mile. And I could try to do the preliminary things. So when you come in, it's more of like, all right, we have those out the way now. It's actually to confirm the number that we're able to give you on your car when we actually see it. Yeah, the car. The car's in. In. In good shape. It's just the bottom has some rust on it. But the. The car itself is. Has always been, you know, worked on by the [OCCUPATION]. And I've never been in an accident, so it's pretty straightforward. Okay. Yeah, let me get that for you. And. Yeah, let me get that for you. Okay, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to send you a quick text message, and then when you send that over to me, at least I can have that. Have that together. So when you do come in, I'm able To kind of give, give you all the numbers and not kind of be choppy with everything. Got it. Okay, that sounds like a good plan. Got it. And if there's any way they can like waive the. The surcharge because we are paying by cash, that would be great. Okay, so again, in terms of this, in terms of the story project, you're talking about the market adjustment. The market adjustment. I could do my best to work to work something out with you, but in terms of waving it, that's gonna be the more, that's not complicated. That's gonna be the more harder thing for us to do. Okay, I understand. I just wanted to put it out there. Of course, of course. So what I'll do again, I'll send you a text message right now and then you send that over to me and then, then I'll start working on my side. So when I do see you on Wednesday again, a smooth. Stay with me. Yeah, no problem. I will do that for you right now. Awesome. Well, thank you so much, [PERSON_NAME]. And I'm looking forward to speaking with you again or seeing you again. Yep, that sounds good. Can you put a hold on the car so it's not one? Yes, I'm actually going to talk with my [OCCUPATION] right now and then, yeah, I'll talk to my [OCCUPATION] right now and I'll actually put the whole side on, tag on there and also confirm that with you as well. That's beautiful. Thank you so much. I appreciate everything. Great. No problem. [PERSON_NAME], thank you so much. Yep, I'll send you the copy. I'll send you a picture of the registration right now. Okay, perfect. I'll see you on Wednesday. See you then. Bye. Bye.",success,price_quote,Miro hybrid,medium,True,11e926f8275c42b6ab3dc78c243ff1ba_transcript.json

I've got a flat tire and I'm wondering what the protocol would be to get my vehicle into the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to get it fixed. Yes. So we would first check with parts really quickly to make sure we have the tire in stock. That way we can replace it for you and then we can get you scheduled to get it put on. Okay.

Yeah, just one second. So it's [ORGANIZATION] PL450. Got an in and out. I didn't end. I'm not catching that. Are you still there? Do you hear me? I can't know. Okay, sorry. So It's a [ORGANIZATION] EL450. And then it says it's 245.45R19, 102V. Okay. I guess my question is, is there a way to patch it instead of like purchasing a new tire with the run parts? They're not actually patchable, unfortunately. They. They come just, you know, they're supposed to be able to be driven on for like 50 miles at low speed after the flat, but. Oh, so I can drive this home? Yeah, you should be able to drive it home. As long as you're going slow, like, you know, not over [DURATION], and you should be fine. Okay, Got it. Yeah. And let me see if I have that in stock. It doesn't look like I have it in stock. It looks like it should see it tomorrow if we order it tomorrow, you know, or today. We should be able to see it by the end of the day tomorrow. If we end up ordering it after [TIME] tomorrow, it would have. Would be, you know, Thursday will be the. Okay, what if. Let Me ask you this, man. What if I just brought the vehicle to shop and just like dropped it off? Well, you, you could do that. We do close at [TIME], so I don't think anybody would be here for you to receive it today. They do have an overnight drop off location after that service and then we can definitely verify that you know the exact tire. You have to make sure that it's not the exact tire I have pulled up here as well. If you do it that way. Okay. Because I, I just. [PERSON_NAME], because I don't want it to. I don't want to have to like get code over there later. You know what I mean? Right, right. I do. I do understand that. Yeah. So should I just drive it over there and drop it off? And if I do, where do I leave my keys? There is an overnight Dropbox that has. So you pretty much just pull up the service area and you should be able to see right there on the right left hand side. Okay. Okay, got it. Well, that's, that's what I'm gonna do. What do I need to do with you? Just order the part? Well, I'd rather verify when, after you drop it off to make sure we're getting an exact tire for you. So I'm not doing the wrong one. Okay. But yeah, the tires should be only like [DURATION] [DURATION] out. If we order it before [TIME], we should see it that same day. So. Okay, so just, just drive on the. Just drive on this bad boy slow. Do about [DURATION] to get to shop. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And I guess one other question. Should I call back tomorrow to let you guys know my vehicle is here? Are you gonna put it in the. Definitely. Definitely call back to the service and you know, make sure that they're processing your vehicle. That way you know, it gets through to us so we can get that tire going. Okay, that sounds good.

Don't hesitate. Get to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to take advantage of this spectacular deal or shop. Hello, this [PERSON_NAME] here with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How can I help you? Yeah, I'm either looking to place an order for a truck, two of them actually, or buy one of a lot. That's pretty close to what I'm looking for. Now I understand that sometimes you guys don't offer Internet price unless we do financing with you. So just wondering what kind of finance options you guys have as far as interest rates for business versus individual. Well, the interest rate for right now we got it at 2.9 right now for all [DATE_INTERVAL] half ton trucks. Are you looking at half ton trucks? The 3,500 dually. Oh, you're looking at a. Okay, he's looking at a one ton truck. Okay, okay. Rates would just all be based off credit, of course. Our goal is to get the best competitive rate that the customer qualifies for. And right now I don't want to just throw a random number out there because it's based off your credit. But with great credit, good credit, you would be anywhere between 5 to 6%. And how about for business? You guys do business transactions? Oh yeah, we do business transactions all the time. Absolutely. I always tell customers the first for the business. It just varies. It can go lower or higher. It just all depends on your Establishment with your. Your business credit. Okay. And then you'll use one of the [OCCUPATION] as a guarantor, Is that right? Repeat that for me one more time. You use one of the [OCCUPATION] of the business as like a guarantor or someone to back the loan, Is that right? You want someone's personal credit only if it's required by the bank. Because sometimes you can just do the straight business. The only time you need someone to co sign for your business, if you don't have credit establishment under your ein number. Okay, well let me give you the stock number and I'd love to see what's possible with getting this out the door for you guys. But let me ask you first, or you can go this route. What's required to put in an order for a truck and what's the turn on time looking like? Yeah, so you're looking at [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] for the turnaround time frame. And There is a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit to secure the order if you decide to go to custom order way. Okay. And you guys, I mean shoot me straight here. Once it gets in stock, I mean we're gonna be dealing with like a [OCCUPATION] markup, you know, like you guys will have what I want, but I can only have it if I pay you guys an extra $[MONEY_AMOUNT] or something crazy. Oh no, no, no. It's no [OCCUPATION] marker. Like right now. Do you see a one ton truck on our website right now? I do. Okay, so that price, what you see, we will honor that. You just have to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] here at our dealership. And that price would be honored, right? I guess, particularly I'm talking about a build. I do a custom build once it gets in stock because I mark up from there. Or how does that work on a custom build? I want a custom build. So it just all depends on what's the going rebate. So custom builds, what we do is we submit the order and at the time, we don't actually agree on number until the vehicle actually arrives because rebates change every [DURATION] [DURATION]. So we don't go off the rebates for the [DURATION] that you put the order in. We go off the rebates once the vehicle comes in and then we work the whole entire deal for you. Okay, what would be needed for me to put in the custom order? I already built what I want on the website. I know all the specs that I want. What's the first step from here? Okay, so if you would like to like, if you want to just do a whole custom order I can. It's easier to come in, but if you do it over the phone, we can't allow that. It just takes a little longer. But you just give us all the options you're looking for. We build it up, we tell you what the price is, and it should be what the MSRP is. And then if you. Okay with the MSRP, you put the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit down, you can do it over the phone. And then when the truck comes in, then work the whole entire deal. Okay. Okay. So about [DURATION] [DURATION] is what you're saying. Let's see here. Well, no, [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. It takes [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay, so if I ordered now, we're looking at the [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL]. We're looking at [DATE_INTERVAL], the earliest. Possibly about [DURATION] [DURATION] out. Correct, correct. So we. In [DATE_INTERVAL]. So you got [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], looking at [DATE_INTERVAL] at the latest. And it could be before [DATE_INTERVAL], but [DATE_INTERVAL] at the latest. Okay. Yeah, No, I am still interested. I think we can make it through the summer without the trucks, but we'll definitely need the trucks before the winter. So I guess I should put in my order now. I'm just kind of just processing out loud now. I'm sorry. You go ahead. My apologies. I thought you were finished. You go ahead. No, no, you're good. You're good. Let me. So, yeah, that's. That's kind of where I am. I got the vehicles that I want already built out. I've got them specked out the way I want them. It's just a matter of, you know, can I order two at the same time or am I obligated to just do one? How do you guys typically work there? No, no, you can do two at the same time. We get customers come in all the time doing more than just one order at the same time. It'd be required to put $[MONEY_AMOUNT] each to start the custom order for the deposit. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, cool. Talking to my guy right now. Let me make sure. Now you mention one on our website. Was it close to what you were looking for? If we can work something on an in stock unit. Yeah, it's pretty close what we're looking for. Let me see if I can pull it up again. Okay, I'll give you a stock. The only reason I bring that up, because if you can get a better deal on the in stock unit, it may be worth looking at before doing a custom order. No, the only reason I brought that up. Yeah, no, it's pretty close what we're looking for. The difference is going to be that it's not a Mega Cab and it's got a couple bells and whistles that we weren't interested in. But let me see. This is stock number. Now, I will tell you now it's going to. It may show up as reserved or I want you to know that I'm the one with the deposit on it just in case you see that. But it's [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. All right. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. Is that correct? That's correct. The [DATE_INTERVAL] Longhorn. Okay. Yeah. It's got it listed for [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I was going to bring some outside financing, but then you guys told me last minute that it has to be [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to get that price. So I've got it added deposit on it. But I'm trying to figure out if we're going to move on this one or just have ours built. I'm pulling up real quick. I want to pull the stock number on it and pull the window sticker while I'm looking at this. Do you. Did you see the window sticker on your end? What options is it missing if you were to do a custom order? Yeah, I'm looking for a Mega Cab for one. Oh, that's a big difference. Okay. Yeah, it's a big difference. Yeah. Yeah. Looking for bed and cap. I'm not really interested in the children's display. I'd rather have a bed liner in place of that. And I mean, it's just. It seems minor, but those are like the big things, you know. I mean, other than that, it is super close what we're looking for. It's got the high output engine, it's got the Eisen transmission and it's got the airbag suspension. Those are the big three. We do a lot of heavy hauling. And it also has a 50 gallon fuel tank. So I'm all on board with. See if we can work something out. But you know, I'm curious on what you can do. Absolutely, absolutely. One moment here. So would you say you would rather go the custom order way or. Because it sounds like the one I have doesn't have the Mega Cab on it. Right. Yeah. I need two of them. If I could secure one now and order the second, I'd be okay with that. If the price is right or if we can't work for the numbers, then I can just do two orders. I gotcha. I gotcha. How you like the online price because that'd be our best offer. We price all our vehicles super competitive within the market so we make sure we're below the market. Out of all our brand dealerships, we with the best price. Is that pricing attractive to you? Yeah, I mean that's what I'm calling like pretty close what I'm looking for. The price isn't too crazy. Once again, when I called earlier this week though, they're like, hey, the only way we can honor that price if you do it [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Secondly, you know, I'm not sure if it's just adding tax tag title to this or if there's like hidden fees, you know what I'm saying? We got to try to tack on $[MONEY_AMOUNT] tumble package, you know what I'm saying? So you know, I'd be curious what the out the door numbers are looking like and what kind of options for businesses your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] can put together. Yeah, for sure, for sure. I will suggest this since you are possibly may do a custom order and possibly looking at our loan. I believe it's the Longhorn Dually that you're looking at the Longhorn Limited. I would suggest take [DURATION] [DURATION] out your time to come in to see the vehicle in person just to make sure it checks out for you. And, and I do know my [OCCUPATION] can give you a great deal with you here in person because our online price, that's, that's just what it is. There's no, nothing hitting with that. It's before your tax title and license. Could you set some time aside to come in and we work a full deal for you? I mean I wouldn't mind coming in but I'm not going to waste my time. I'm down in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] so that's a [DURATION] [DURATION] round trip. Oh no, we can make, no, we're not going to waste, we don't make it work. We're not going, we're not going to lose business overpriced for sure. So for me, I don't even get emotionally attached to it either. The specs are there, they're not. And so I guess I'm just trying to figure out is, you know, what is, what can your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] do on a business loan? So that's a, that's a call where you get the transfer over to your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and we just start talking. That's fine. Just trying to see what the numbers are looking like here. Well, in order for us to give you an accurate number, we have to actually submit your credit app to the bank. Correct. And then at that point for me to finance then that's fine. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Well, I'm saying we have to first agree on the price first before you even get the finance. The finance just going to tell you to submit the credit app online for it and we can submit your business app is that the online price is the best foot forward. So we have the price. We're going to add 6.25% and any other tax fees that's associated with it. And that's the [ORGANIZATION] price. Just doing some quick calculating right now. 86.381times [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus [MONEY_AMOUNT] daily box fee. We're looking at about $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So I know where we are on the right. If you transfer to finance, it's fine. Either we're going to make money together or not. No, what I'm saying is we have to have your. We can't just guess what your interest rate is. That's why I'm saying you have to fill out a credit app. They can tell you [DURATION] [DURATION] what your rate can possibly be, but you don't really know. Maybe we're saying the same thing with different words. I'm saying I know what the price is. I know I have to do a credit app. If you transfer me through that credit app and talk to your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Let's do that. Well, they. I handle the credit app. I can send you the credit app to your email, your phone, however you prefer. Is that something you'd like for me to do? Let's do. Okay, one moment. What's a good callback number? This one here. [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER]. Okay. I have someone reach out to you to follow up on your questions just to see if they can give you an estimate. But in the meantime, I'll shoot you over the business credit app. Okay, Sounds good. Okay.",success,price_quote,unknown,medium,False,1219ac8be6eb4475a96e601c5dbe4464_transcript.json
"Hello? Hello, good evening, is this [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. Hello, [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], I'm calling from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I was calling in regards to your online inquiry for a new [ORGANIZATION] Corolla cross. Are you still in the market for that vehicle? Yeah, I'm just sort of, I'm just trying to figure out if it makes sense to, to trade in my used car for, for, for new one. My car's paid in full, so I just, I don't need to trade it in. Like, I'm fine without a car payment. I'm very happy about a car payment, but I just don't know if it kind of makes sense to do it now because of the way car prices are going. Like, I guess I won't get more than I am going to get now for my car. So that's what I'm looking into it. I don't know what I'm going to do really. Well, [PERSON_NAME], you hit the nail on the head with that last statement. You're never going to be able to get more than you can for it right now. And that's because the values are still high for used vehicles. And the reason being is because there's limited availability for good vehicles out there. So if you do find one, you're going to see that the price is high for used vehicles, so they're going to overpay for your vehicle right now. If you were to hold onto it and put more miles or if something happens to it, you're potentially losing out on [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] that you can get back from paying on that vehicle. So if you've taken care of your vehicle, if it doesn't have crazy high mileage, I would definitely recommend you come in to see what we can offer you both on that vehicle and a newer one of your choice. Also keep in mind the true cost to own on the, for services, for repairs, for maintenance, all that will come out of your pocket and be expensive if you keep on driving your vehicle because as time goes on, you have wear and tear items like hoses, belts, tires that will eventually need to be replaced. So even if you're not paying on the vehicle now, you will eventually have to come out of pocket later. And if you can get the most for your vehicle now and trade it in, you can forget about having to do all those repairs, having to invest more money into it to keep it on the road. When you can get into something nicer, newer, at an affordable payment that's going to have warranties, free maintenance for [DURATION] [DURATION] and free roadside assistance. So There's a lot of benefits. I need an opportunity to show you on paper how you can benefit. And that's all we ask for, is an opportunity to show you. At the end of the day, if you don't like those numbers or figures, you can always keep your vehicle. And we're still going to thank you for coming out and giving us a shot to help you. When would you have some time to come out and visit with us? I'll have to talk to my [MARITAL_STATUS] about that. Maybe Friday or Saturday we can try or. Yeah, I think it has to be Friday. So what time is it best for you? I am interested, so I don't know. I need to get with him. I'm not sure what his schedule looks like. No worries. I'm gonna be out tomorrow, but I'll be back Thursday at [TIME]. But what I'll do is I'll text you my information and I'll also email you. So that way you have three avenues. You can call me, you can text me, or you can email me and just update me and let me know what time is best for you to visit. We do have some Corolla crosses here on the lot that are pre owned. Those vehicles are hard to come by on the new side just because it's a new vehicle that was released and there's a high demand for it. So if you're looking for a new one, it will require a deposit of $[MONEY_AMOUNT] and a wait. We don't know how long the wait will be, but we do have plenty of incoming options that are not reserved that you can choose from. But at least by visiting you can get a feel for the vehicle. You can test drive the used ones, and if you want to go with used, we have low mileage ones here that offer certified warranties up to 100,000 miles. So the benefit of coming to us, [PERSON_NAME], is we're the top dealership in the region, in the city. We can offer more money for your vehicle and we have the best and most selection of vehicles to offer you at the best price. So I'm here to save you time and money, speak with your [MARITAL_STATUS], see what time is best for you all to come out on Friday. And if you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. I'm here to provide an excellent buying experience for you. Do you have any questions or concerns at this time? Well, yeah, I want to know. Those the pre owned that you're talking about, are they. What's the price range on those? Let me get that for you right now. I have you on the phone. Surprisingly, we have a good amount of these on the lot. Typically we only have like less than a handful most of the time. But the inventory has been fluctuating on this vehicle on the used side. On the new side it's still the same. They are pre sold before they arrive. But let me get you the pricing and the info on what I have available right now on the lot. The lowest mileage one I'm going to have on the lot is going to be [DATE_INTERVAL] Corolla Cross Le Sellistite exterior which is the blue gray color. It only has 681 miles. It's going for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Now that one is certified up to 100,000 miles, so you get a longer warranty and coverage because the new one is only [DURATION] [DURATION] 60,000 miles. But it is considered certified pre owned but only 681 miles, so practically still brand new. The next one I'm going to have is a [DATE_INTERVAL] Corolla Cross XLE which is a mid level trim or actually the higher level trim. And then you have 21,000 miles on this one. $[MONEY_AMOUNT] is what is showing. $[MONEY_AMOUNT] is the price. I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Corolla Cross XLE and Jet Black with 20,876 miles. That one's going for $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Chose to be certified one [ORGANIZATION] owner. Then I also have a [DATE_INTERVAL] Corolla Cross Xle with the convenience package and blue Crush exterior with 6,260 miles on for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I can send you a link to your email to where you can click on the picture. It will take you to our website and show you all these vehicles that are here. Sometimes if they're certified pre owned and they have a stock photo, sometimes those vehicles have not arrived or they're in process going through our shop. So if it has an actual photo, most of the time it's still here. But sometimes vehicles do sell fast and they're not quick enough to pull them down for the website and sometimes they'll take them down the next day. So just want you to be aware, I want to be upfront and transparent with you so you have the right expectations when you visit with us. Okay, so I was looking at [ORGANIZATION] website and they had brand new ones and maybe they're just like very basic and those that you're mentioning are They've got more features on them, but they were like starting at [MONEY_AMOUNT] or something. So I guess it was super basic. Right? So the question I'm trying to figure out is right now is it better to buy like I'm in no rush, right? So is it better to buy a brand new vehicle because they're like cheaper or not as are they cheaper or like better deals on them or. To be honest, the price that you're seeing on the [ORGANIZATION] website is the vehicle based model msrp. That price is going to be before factory installed packages and accessories. It's going to be before [OCCUPATION] installed packages and accessories. And then you have [OCCUPATION] installed packages and accessories and delivery, processing and handling fees. All those fees, except for the [OCCUPATION] install packages and accessories are out of our control. Those are the charges that come from the manufacturer. But the base model Corolla LE is going to have a MSRP on the website of around $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So after all those FE and the installed packages, you are looking at $[MONEY_AMOUNT] before tax, title and license. Tax, title, license, you're looking [MONEY_AMOUNT], around [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Now I do have to be honest with you. Some of these used vehicles, they cost just as much or sometimes a little less or a little more than a new one. But the reason is because those are available to buy off the lot the day that you visit. The new ones are not going to be readily available to test Dr. Or to buy off the lot unless someone doesn't show up in time to take delivery of the one that they put the deposit on. Because when you come in, if you want a new one, we have to do a credit qualification through [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Since the vehicle is not here in our dealership or at our dealership, but it's in our allocation, we can still mark it off as sold, but the only way to do that is to go through [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. We do the credit qualifying through them, show you what you qualify for. After you pick out a vehicle that you want to buy and then we come to agreement on the terms. And once we do that, then we accept your deposit of $[MONEY_AMOUNT] with cash, check or debit. That's going to take that vehicle out of the market, mark it off as sold, and then when it's in transit, we reach out to let you know that it's on the way. When it arrives, we tell you you have [DURATION] [DURATION] to take delivery or it goes on sale to the public. That [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], it can be used as a down payment. Upon taking delivery, or you can ask for it back when you're coming in to finish the contract. You can also finance with whoever you like. You don't have to finance with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], but in order to reserve it, we have to do the qualifying and come to an agreement and accept that deposit. That's the way these new in demand vehicles are being sold. So if you're not in a rush and you prefer new, you can come in and place a deposit, get what you're looking for as long as it's available in our allocation. Because they have not been accepting orders or builds due to the limited availability last [DURATION] [DURATION] because of [MEDICAL_CONDITION] affecting the manufacturer's production. So it's really a preference and what you're trying to accomplish. If you're looking to get something soon, I'd recommend those certified pre owns like the one with only 600 miles. Sometimes we get those, and those are incredible deals because it already comes with a certified Warranty, up to 100,000 miles for the powertrain warranty. So that's how you benefit with the new. With the used one. Okay, and that one, you said it was at [MONEY_AMOUNT] something or what? Was that the price on that one? It's okay. That one has 681 miles. It has a stock photo, so it might not be here yet. But that price is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's a great price. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so I'll talk to my [MARITAL_STATUS] and maybe we can go by Friday. I'm not in a rush and what I want is this, like, you know, I've got a car in really great condition and if I can get the most money for it now, I think I want to make the move now, but, you know, it's not like a big deal to me if I don't because I'm happy with the car. I hear you. Well, it sounds like you're in a great position because your vehicle is paid off. And then by coming to visit with us, you get transparency, you get honesty, and then you get the best price out there. Because I'm in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] here, we shop our price around. We know what the other dealerships have, we know what they're charging. So that's why I'm here to tell you that I'm here to save you time and money because there's no other dealership that can offer you what we have here. When you get here, you're going to see how many vehicles we have and how big our dealership is. And then you're going to know that we are the top dealership in this town. So I look forward to hearing back from you. Like I said, I'll be out tomorrow, but you can still text me, email me if you know a good time that you want to visit on Friday and I'll go ahead and set that up for you when I get back in on Thursday at [TIME]. But I can send you that link to your email [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Is that the best email address to reach you at? Yes. Okay, I'm going to send you a link for the use one. You got to click on the picture to go to our website. And then I'm going to attach the spec sheets for the new ones so you can see the pricing breakdown for the new one and then you can compare and decide whatever is best for you. But I do have to let you know vehicles with that low mileage, especially on this vehicle, the Corolla Cross, they don't last long because it's a popular vehicle and a lot of people are looking for it. Okay. Yeah. If you also have information on the CH R, what they stop, they stop making that one. Yeah. But if you have like any that have really low mileage, that's another one that my [MARITAL_STATUS] was recommending. So that's a great car that women love. It looks like I have a couple used options. It's showing on my website. They're both stock photos, so it might not have arrived yet and they might be, or they might be in process. But I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] CHR LE with 42,000 miles. It's Blizzard Pearl for $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then I have a [DATE_INTERVAL] CHR Nightshade, which is the blackout package with the black wheels and it's all black, 26,000 miles going for [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So I have plenty of options to offer you. I hope you can come out as soon as you can to get the best selection and best choice. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. You're welcome. [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Thank you for speaking with me. Have a good night. Thank you. Bye.

If you know your party's extension, you may dial it at any time. For [ORGANIZATION], press [PHONE_NUMBER]. For [ORGANIZATION], [PHONE_NUMBER]. For [ORGANIZATION], press [PHONE_NUMBER]. For [ORGANIZATION], press [PHONE_NUMBER]. Thank you for calling. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I help you? Oh, hi. I have a question. I received an email about a deal or sale or loyalty rebate. No, not rebate for leasing. Yes, it's called the lease loyalty rebate. Are you currently in a [ORGANIZATION] lease? Yes. Yeah, so if you, if you release a new [ORGANIZATION] because you have that current lease, the [ORGANIZATION] manufacturer is giving a up to a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], depending on which car, as a loyalty rebate, to lease a new one. So if you're interested in for instance, the Accord Gaff, or let me see, the Accord Gas. Hold on. I think I just realized, I misunderstood. So you're saying only if we turn in the current. Correct. Yeah. Lease a different vehicle in addition another [ORGANIZATION] or different brand [ORGANIZATION]. In other words, my daughter's Civic is going to be. Her lease will be up in another year. She's had it for [DURATION] [DURATION]. We. She wants to keep it and more than likely she's going to end up buying it at the end of the lease. But my son needs a car, but we've been shying away because of the interest has really gone up and he's trying to calculate the numbers on leasing. When I saw that email, I thought this is too good to be true. No, it does apply. Do all of you live at the same address? I'm sorry, what? Do all of you live at the same address? Yeah. Okay, so because of that and you already have a [ORGANIZATION] in your household, that would give you guys the loyalty rebates on and on the next car that you leave. Oh, without turning in my daughter. Yes. You just have to prove ownership. So like just take your daughter's registration card that shows the VIN in that address, then you would get the loyalty rebate. It's a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] on an Accord or a Ridgeline and it's. And [MONEY_AMOUNT] on every other car. He was looking. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. He was looking at one of the Civics. I mean it could be the base Civic, it could be a hatchback, I don't know, it depends what's affordable, but. Gotcha. My daughter has the base like line Civic, just the all Galaxy. Yeah. Just the gas, the, you know, the least expensive, but it's really nice. It's not the sport, it's not, you know. Yes, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, so with that said, my [MARITAL_STATUS] co. Signed with my daughter, so he's on the lease. He would be doing the same with my son. With that said, I already know his credit score because doesn't it kind of go by that too? On what kind of doing. No, you just need to qualify for tier one, which is. It's easy. With [ORGANIZATION], it's a 660 on Experian. Oh, he's 800. Yeah, I just was always told, like, you get a. A better. It depends on where you score. Yeah. Meaning you either qualify for the lease rate or you don't. But 800. Oh, okay. Oh, well, I'm really qualified. I didn't know if that affected the price. No, one thing has nothing to do with the other. Okay, so with all that said, you were not you. The email was showing examples of putting like [PHONE_NUMBER], [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], basically [MONEY_AMOUNT] down on a lease for [DURATION] [DURATION]. Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Well, we would custom tailor one for you, but remember, on a Civic, you'd have to pay for the accessories as well. Most dealerships are marking up their Civics because there's so little of them right now. The deals are really on the Accords and stuff like that. I mean, like I said, we can custom tailor a lease for you. Did you lease your car here? Yes. You're an [OCCUPATION], right? Yeah. Okay, I have a question. And I know, we'll come in and look because there was an extreme shortage when she got hers, interest was less. Okay, I have a question. I know the Accord is a bigger car. Is there another [ORGANIZATION] that we're not aware of, that popular with young with like [PERSON_AGE] year olds? I just only know civics. The HRV. Oh, yeah. You guys. You guys worked with [PERSON_NAME] last time. I'm sorry, what? You guys worked with [PERSON_NAME] last time. It looks like he's still here. Oh, you're looking at my phone number. Yeah. Mrs. [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. But I'm like, is that one less expensive or is it more the hrv? It's. It's probably similar to the Civic. Okay, so you're saying the deal really wouldn't or the. It's not really what. It's showing because it would go up because of accessories, you're saying. Correct. I'm just being transparent with you. I don't want. You don't know. We, my [MARITAL_STATUS] and I always go over all the hidden fees first. Yeah, yeah. No, yeah. Even in. I even saw in small print it said excludes taxes. Well, correct. Tax, title, license, and any additional accessories. Yeah, but this is what I want to do. I have about four [OCCUPATION] in front of me. I need to give them some numbers. But I got your number here, and when I get a second, I'll call you back and go over all the stuff that we have available and maybe even set up another time for you to come see us and give you the treatment that you deserve.

Thanks, [PERSON_NAME]. I do appreciate the patience. I do apologize. I got tied up with something here. What type of trim level you looking for in the four door Bronco? I'm not 100% sure. Right. So the two criteria for my [MARITAL_STATUS] are manual transmission, four door. We definitely don't want to go up to the raptor level. But as we've been looking around, we've seen like Badlands being good for us. Yeah, we're looking. Batlands seem to be the most available in what we're looking for. And I'm not sure if that's a trim level or a model. What exterior color are you open to? Lighter, darker, not black. Okay, what engine you looking to get, the [PHONE_NUMBER] liter or the 2.7 liter? Well, as far as I know in manual transmission you could only get the 2.3. But I could be mistaken because I have an [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] that I know. Have you guys seen how to test drive one? No, we were like wanted to make sure we could even find one that we're interested in before we go. I'm gonna. Here's what I want to do, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm gonna get you the information on the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] four door one that I have that's available for you to come and test drive. That's on the lot today. And I can even offer you a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] gift card for your time and travel. Let me get what's a good email. Cool. It's [PERSON_NAME] [EMAIL_ADDRESS] [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. But I'm actually on your guys website right now looking at the five models it says are available. Which one would this be? The one I'm looking at is stock number F is in Frank 30015 and it's [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is the exterior. So I see that one right here. Yeah, that's the one I'm referring. There might be others, don't get me wrong. And then we are getting them in day by day. Most of these are customer orders. And what happens is our job is to call the customer when they come in to inform them that they're Here. But sometimes, I mean, I ordered a vehicle, it took [DURATION] [DURATION]. I thought it was forever. I can't imagine waiting over [DURATION] [DURATION]. So, yes, it's not unlikely. They don't buy it and we stock it in, they're able to sell it public type of thing. Totally understood. Now, this one says it's a 2.3. Yes. With the manual, I think they all are. That's right. All right, cool. Now, as far as something like this goes, you know, I know there's like the sticker price and like, what it says msrp. What are you guys generally doing in regards to that pricing like this? Good question. This one's up [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. That's what it says up top. The msrp. Gotcha. And is that generally all of yours will be in that [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] range over msrp? Yeah, I mean, like I said, that's how we're getting inventory. So that's why I price it. We don't want to do that. But I mean, that's what. That's what's happening, I guess. Best way. I understand. I have another stock number here. Can you take a look at this one? She really likes this color as well. Yeah. What do you have? It's E 30175. Have you ever been to [LOCATION] at all the dealerships that we have here? Okay. Where you come from? [LOCATION], I guess. Yeah. [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. So, you know, you're not. Terrible distance. All right. You looking to turn anything in by chance? We have a car to turn in, but, you know, we're actually prepared to come, you know, with a canvas sack full of cash money to make this deal happen at the right price. [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. it didn't work. Gluck, [PERSON_NAME], this is you, right? Okay, I got it now. I had to click up, right. It's early Sunday morning. Taking it to me. [PERSON_NAME] got eight [ORGANIZATION] stores, but this is kind of like the main one. And what happens is online, it's hard to tell if it's a customer order or not. This is an inbound unit, and it probably, like I said, is a customer order. The [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] job is to call the customer once it hits the ground and inform them that their vehicle is here. And then if they want to take it, we sell it to them. If they don't, then we can stock it in to sell it to the public. We're closer than the other [ORGANIZATION] store this is at, and it's not there. Now. What I would recommend find a good day or time to stop in here at Least I have the [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. You can test drive it, get a feel for it and then the [OCCUPATION] can work with you guys if it doesn't work out for you to find something else as they come in. I can also take $[MONEY_AMOUNT] gift card. I understand that. And is the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] the only one you have on the lot or is there another one also? So we make the trip out there, she may be able to check out a couple different options. I got a red wild track I'm very familiar with. I got a two door white, white one that's 2.3. It's an automatic I think on the white one. Yeah, no, that is the one that's. We have others that are slated to come in. I have a green one. It's a badlands. I can give you the stock number for that. If you want to write this down, take a look at it while you. No, I see that on your website too. That's here too. That's a manual also. 2.3 liter. So we have inventory. This is like [PERSON_NAME] main store. So we seem to have always do pretty well with inventory. Let me do this. I'm going to. I emailed you my information so you have it. [PERSON_NAME], I'm going to text you too. If you want to talk to your [MARITAL_STATUS], see if there's a good day or time, just let me know. We'd love for you to take the trip and put things together. We're hot today, right? So we're calling around, see what's available and where we're going to go and you know, make this trip. So let me just go see. I haven't got your email yet so I want to make sure I get it before we. It could go to the junk junker spam folder. Just double check that. All right, let me. Let me do this here too. See I can resend it too just in case. Make sure I got the address right. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] I mean to be honest with you, we get deliveries like once a [DURATION] and if you come down today and it doesn't work, the [OCCUPATION] knows your name. A new one comes in, they call you the end of the [DURATION], say, hey, we got another one just came in. Do you want to do this? It seems like more. That happens frequently too. That's what we did. Just get your email here. So I guess my next question is I'm going to show this to her. Like I said, we're kind of hot to trot today. Realistically with that arc up on the msrp. How negotiable is that? You know, because obviously we're not looking to get, we're not looking for [EVENT] [EVENT] sale below msrp. We know that's not even a fat chance. But you know, trying to get as close to MSRP as possible, it makes us feel good. Yes. I can't change anything, to be honest with you. And I think we are known to price them pretty aggressively based upon the market inventory and things like that. Got you. So the price. And they were priced. And they were priced a lot more than that at times too. As high as that [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] on top. So they have come down a bit already, it seems. Awesome. That one you're selling for [MONEY_AMOUNT] and has a sticker of [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yep. Cool. Yeah, we're a large volume [OCCUPATION] so we're pretty transparent in what we do. A lot of repeat customers. We've been here. It's a very large store too. We've been here. We have eight cars in the showroom. We've been here since [DATE_INTERVAL]. Yeah, I text you too and stay in touch. I'm here for you. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Hopefully you're from me. I'm going to go show you guys. Can you send info on the green one also, if you wouldn't mind, the same type of email you sent. Yes, definitely. I can do that as soon as I get off the phone. Thank you so much. You got a nice [DURATION] with you. Stay in touch. Awesome. You take care of.",success,inventory_check,Bronco,high,True,123c8d0e523641d0a5e2d6b535dc1a30_transcript.json
