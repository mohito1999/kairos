I am a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] on a recorded line. Okay. Hi, I have Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. She lives in a very beautiful state of [LOCATION] with the zip code [LOCATION]. Is there any other information that you would require? Does she have Medicare A and B? She has part A and part B on her Medicare. Sure.

Thank you for your patience while you were transferred in. How is your day going so far today? So far so good. Well, it is nice to meet you again. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and I am licensed in your state of [LOCATION]. I do work here at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and I help folks select Medicare Advantage as well as Medicare supplement options to save every month on their Medicare costs. Maybe even get additional healthy food, over the counter vision dental benefit. So I would be happy to help. I would love to see what you're eligible for and entitled to. Well, I'm glad that you get over the counter. I am a [OCCUPATION]. I work with all the major carriers and I'd be happy to compare options in your area, see if there's a plan that can upgrade your benefits. There's no health information required unless for enrollment. And this call is recorded. So it sounds as though you have part C of Medicare. Medicare Advantage, is that right? What? Say that again. So you have Medicare. You said that you interjected that you have over the counter benefits, is that correct? So you have a Medicare Advantage plan. Okay, great. So you already know how it works with part C, right? So you have your A, hospital and B, medical. You have C instead, right? Yeah. Okay. And what's currently your copay when you. When you have to see a specialist what are you seeing? What are you paying for that? I haven't been paying anything lately. I gotta go this month. Okay, so you don't got it. So you don't pay a copay for a specialist at all? Zero copay. That's pretty good. I don't pay my. My medicine. I haven't paid anything on the medicine. Okay. Oh, well, that's great. So it sounds like you're taking some prescriptions and you don't have any CO pays, Is that right? Haven't had any yet. I mean, this year. Okay. Well, that's definitely nice. It sounds like you might have some extra help besides just Medicare. Do you have main care? Is that right? Yes, I do. Okay, so you have both Medicare and Medicaid. So you are dually eligible for benefits. Okay, so you mentioned that you have over the counter with your plan. Do you also have a food benefit that gives you a grocery card? Let me see. No, I guess not. You don't have a grocery card. Okay, and then what about dental benefits? You receive dental? Yes. Okay, and then eyeglass benefits. Do you have those? Transportation. Okay. And you said no CO pays on prescription. Oh, that's nice that your daughter lives nearby. It's good to have family. For sure. That's wonderful. How many daughters do you have? I have three and three boys. Three daughters? Oh, my goodness. Six kids. I was busy there way back. Wow. Well, it sounds like you were having fun, huh? That's a lot of fun. You had like, a baseball team, huh? Wow. I can't even keep the house clean with three kids. That's what we used to do, play ball. Oh, that's so cool. Six kids. Do you have any grandkids? I bet you have grandkids too, too, right? I got them. I got them in every state, I think. Oh, talk about being fruitful and multiplying. Good for you. What a blessing, huh? Yes. Yes, they are a blessing. Wow. Yeah. No, that's cool. How's it hard? It's probably hard not to have a favorite, huh? Yeah, it is. You be quiet. Yeah. We won't talk about who your favorite is, though. Everybody wants to be Mom's favorite. No, you love all of them, I'm sure. Okay, so you said you have over the counter, you have dental, you have [MEDICAL_PROCESS], you have zero copay. Sounds like your plan is pretty good. Are you with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Do you have [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION]? You have [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, got it. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yeah, [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is pretty big. Yeah, I wouldn't or anything unless they kick me out well, we could see. I mean, if you could get it. Oh, no, I don't want to mess anything up for you. It sounds like you have a good thing going. But if you have Medicaid and Medicare, you should be getting a food card through [ORGANIZATION]. Are you on their dual plan? Did you just recently get your main care? Well, I can't remember when it started. When it started. Did you go to a dual plan? No, they just added it. I didn't have anything to do with it, really. Okay. Well, I mean, I'd be happy to check. I'm starting to have the [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah, I forget a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that. Did one of your kids help you with your. Oh, yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. No, I'm very lucky. Your daughter helps you. Oh, yeah, my daughter [PERSON_NAME], she helps me a lot. Well, if you are eligible for a food card through [ORGANIZATION], then you should definitely see, because if you don't have any CO pays as of this year, if you've gotten main care, then you would qualify for the dual plan. Now, because you have [MEDICAL_CONDITION], obviously, I wouldn't make any changes for you, of course, without your power of [OCCUPATION] or not the right [OCCUPATION] there. But you can take down my information, Ms. [PERSON_NAME], because you may be able to upgrade to the dual plan. And the [ORGANIZATION] has a dual plan? Yeah. I don't understand all that, you know. So I don't get a dual. Oh, yeah. No, it is. It is hard to follow. Right. So there's regular Medicare Advantage plans. What? Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah, you were saying something? No, I can't. No, no. I'm just worried because I don't know if I'm doing the right things or if I'm missing out or whatever. I'm not complaining. Right. I don't want you to miss out on anything, for sure. I mean, I could look up your plan if you'd like. Do you have your red, white and blue Medicare card? I could see what plan you're on. I don't know where it is. Right behind it. No, don't worry. Don't bother. Well, if you have your ID card. Member ID card for [ORGANIZATION], what I would suggest you do. If you're confused about your benefits, and obviously you don't want to make any changes because you won't remember them, you have [MEDICAL_CONDITION], you can call [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and see if you're eligible for the food card because you may very well be missing out on benefits that you didn't even know you were entitled to. So I would definitely give them a call. Okay. All right. Well, I appreciate your time, Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. So if you have [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah. You were going to call [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I'm so confused. God. Yeah, no, I don't want to confuse you for sure, but if your daughter has health cards, I mean, you could just say. Yeah, no, I get it. You could just say that. Ask your daughter to call [ORGANIZATION]. Maybe. And maybe see if you can get the grocery card, because they do offer a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] grocery card for folks that have Medicare and Medicaid. Yeah. So you may be eligible for it, but if you're confused, I don't feel comfortable proceeding. So you can call the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] number, and I'll just put a note in here not to give you any more calls about your insurance. Okay. Okay. I guess so. My daughter's coming over there. Wow. Is your daughter coming over? Okay, well, you can definitely have her give us a call. Okay. All right. And that's the number that you just called, right? As I call. I don't know what. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Have you got your. Want to give me your number? Are you there? Oh, she hung up.",failure,True,False,True,True,2076160516_P2_transcript.json

And Ms. [PERSON_NAME], do you only see a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] or do you also see specialists? I see a specialist. I see two. I said yes, I see a specialist. A [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. I see him once [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. Okay. All right, [OCCUPATION], is that this for, like, a checkup? Yes, the checkup. Okay. Now, do you have any major [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION], [MEDICAL_CONDITION], [MEDICAL_CONDITION], [MEDICAL_CONDITION], [INJURY], anything like that? No, I'm not. No [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. They've been checked. They don't check for that. I'm not. No, [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. Okay, good, good. All right, so it does look like you're currently on the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Medicare Advantage. Okay. And looks like you've been on that since [DATE_INTERVAL], but you've had [ORGANIZATION] since [DATE_INTERVAL]. Before that, it looks like you were on [ORGANIZATION]. Do you know why you switched from [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION]? I had. Because I had [ORGANIZATION] deal last year. I've been having all. Was this [ORGANIZATION], Medicare Advantage from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. Right. I didn't have get out of here all this year. All righty. Now, do you know why you switched though, from [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION]? No, not really. Okay, no worries. In quite a while. So I didn't. Yeah. Yes, it's. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME]. You were with [ORGANIZATION] all of last year and you've been with [ORGANIZATION] since [DATE_INTERVAL]? [DATE_INTERVAL], yes. All right. Now I'm going to check on it for you though. Okay. All right. Because I do actually represent all of the companies available to you, including [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], a lot of them. So I'm going to look to see. Alrighty. What we're doing here. All righty, let's see now. Do you still use the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yes. Okay, and then [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], is that your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]? She was the one seen after [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] passed. Okay. Primary position now is. Let me see, I'm gonna. Let me spell it. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. So and [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Got it. All right, and then what's the name of your [OCCUPATION]? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, got it. All right. Okay. And so let me just continue here. Mail [ORGANIZATION] [PHONE_NUMBER] and you go to the [ORGANIZATION] that's on [LOCATION] [LOCATION], right? Yes. Okay. All right, so let's see what I can do to best help you. All righty. Okay. No premium. Okay. Look at a couple things. Full dental vision, hearing. Perfect. Oh no, this wouldn't count for you. All righty, so I'm going to pull up what you currently have so I can compare everything to see which one truly is best. You're in [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. Okay, here we are. You have Medicare Advantage HMO documents. Summary. Okay. S300 OTC, you get [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Okay, so it'll be a 35. All right, well, character, Alexa, Liberty, nurture. Get that? New plans. Alrighty, summary. Okay. F3 Dental. Alrighty. Lifetime. Yes, this is definitely going to be a lot stronger. OTC [MONEY_AMOUNT] grocery. No. All right, so like your plan, currently, like you, yes, you do have full dental. However, they only give you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] in dental benefits. Whereas I'm looking at another one that would give you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] in benefits for [MONEY_AMOUNT] dental. Now you do get an [DRUG] [DRUG] [DRUG] allowance to be which is like a mail in already. And, and they give you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] every [DURATION] [DURATION] where this one would give you $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right. And this one would also give you what's called a flex card. Well, it's not [DRUG] [DRUG]. It's also for the kind of medicine. So I, I have that and when. But other than that. But. Right, right. So now this is not just for [DRUG] [DRUG] [DRUG] [DRUG]. This is also for your toiletries. You can use it for like toothpaste, deodorant, toilet paper, things like that. Yeah, I have it. Yeah. Right. So right now that you give me [MONEY_AMOUNT], this will give you [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Now this is, but this is also just a lot stronger, like for your dental and vision and hearing. So like your dental, you're only getting [MONEY_AMOUNT] where this would give you [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So I really don't, I don't want to change. No insurance or nothing like that, just for that. So, so. Oh no, I understand. Okay, that's fine. We don't have to. I'm going to say that these plans are just a lot, a lot, a lot stronger. Now it does show that you do. So you don't pay like you don't pay the premium, but you do still have co pays. You do still have to pay like co pays. So let me see. See Plan. The only school payment I pay is that special. And it's a small, it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that's. Yeah, it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Correct. Okay, that's it. The [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and, and the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Right, right, right, exactly. Now let's see. Now it is just like, it is just good because like God forbid you did ever end up in the hospital and got admitted, you know, right now it would cost you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per [DURATION] for the first [DURATION] [DURATION], whereas the one that would give you more back and all the other benefits would only cost you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per [DURATION] per [DURATION] for the first [DURATION] [DURATION]. So that would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT] a [DURATION] savings. But that's the worst case scenario if you ended up [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So it really just depends, you know. Yes, it would be a new insurance carrier. However, of course I always check to make sure your [OCCUPATION] accept it. So that way it doesn't affect any of your [DURATION] to [DURATION] life, you know. So that would be the only thing that would change is the actual name of the carrier. Not your [OCCUPATION], not your pharmacy or anything like that. All right. Because this truly is a much better plan. I mean, I know if you want to stay with [ORGANIZATION], I can look just at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I just know you. [ORGANIZATION] doesn't have a strong benefit. The only good thing about [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, I'm sorry. This one I have is aarp, Medicare Advantage from [ORGANIZATION]. Right. It didn't. It been dormant. Right. So for. So you know. Right. I hear you changing. I, I understand completely. No, I will. Obviously I'm not going to do anything that you don't want to do. It's just a matter of, you know, a matter of saving money. It's saving money and getting more back. So that's what we do here. That's the whole point of looking for additional benefit. Now, again, I can tell me about the money back on my Social Security check. And I've been told that all down to [DURATION] [DURATION], but I never got nothing back on it. So I just said I don't even think about it no more. Well, that's why I'll explain that to you then right now. So some people do qualify for the money back into their Social Security check. Now, those people are people who do not have extra help or partial extra help. So what happens is everybody who has Medicare Part B who do not have extra help, they pay $[MONEY_AMOUNT] every month for their part B. That's just regulated by the government. So what all these insurance carriers, did they. That it's called a part B reduction. So they put money back into the check as a part B reduct. Now, since you do not pay for your part B, it would not qualify you for a part B reduction. So that's the only way you can get the money back is if you pay Medicare. So if you Medicare, which people do not have extra help, they pay $[MONEY_AMOUNT] every month for their part B. Because you have part extra help, you do not pay the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that's, that's, that would be the only way you would qualify to get money back is if you did pay for part B. I paid, paid that. $[MONEY_AMOUNT] is out of my check every month. Let me see here. Let me look here. Because it tells me and I do get the extra help on my going to medicine. I don't pay anything for that. So. Okay, let me check here. So if you do, I'm gonna have someone look at this then. So if you do, then yeah, of course I'm gonna look at the extra money to get you back because I know [LOCATION] does have plans. Let's see. Premium details. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [PERSON_NAME] enrollment, [EVENT] amount. Okay. Alrighty. It does look like you do all right. Yes. Usually people, when I see extra help, they don't pay it. So let me look then. Definitely should qualify if you pay that. Let's see, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, so let's look then. Gotcha. [PERSON_NAME]. Here. Plans compare. Now you say you see your [OCCUPATION] once [DURATION] [DURATION], right? Yeah, once [DURATION] [DURATION]. Oh, yes. You pay 50% of premium, max. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so let's see what we can do here because it looks like the drugs you're taking are pretty generic and common, so those aren't going to be a big cost. Okay, let's see here. Okay. Give back hmo.
