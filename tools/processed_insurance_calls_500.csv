I am a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] on a recorded line. Okay. Hi, I have Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. She lives in a very beautiful state of [LOCATION] with the zip code [LOCATION]. Is there any other information that you would require? Does she have Medicare A and B? She has part A and part B on her Medicare. Sure.

Thank you for your patience while you were transferred in. How is your day going so far today? So far so good. Well, it is nice to meet you again. My name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and I am licensed in your state of [LOCATION]. I do work here at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and I help folks select Medicare Advantage as well as Medicare supplement options to save every month on their Medicare costs. Maybe even get additional healthy food, over the counter vision dental benefit. So I would be happy to help. I would love to see what you're eligible for and entitled to. Well, I'm glad that you get over the counter. I am a [OCCUPATION]. I work with all the major carriers and I'd be happy to compare options in your area, see if there's a plan that can upgrade your benefits. There's no health information required unless for enrollment. And this call is recorded. So it sounds as though you have part C of Medicare. Medicare Advantage, is that right? What? Say that again. So you have Medicare. You said that you interjected that you have over the counter benefits, is that correct? So you have a Medicare Advantage plan. Okay, great. So you already know how it works with part C, right? So you have your A, hospital and B, medical. You have C instead, right? Yeah. Okay. And what's currently your copay when you. When you have to see a specialist what are you seeing? What are you paying for that? I haven't been paying anything lately. I gotta go this month. Okay, so you don't got it. So you don't pay a copay for a specialist at all? Zero copay. That's pretty good. I don't pay my. My medicine. I haven't paid anything on the medicine. Okay. Oh, well, that's great. So it sounds like you're taking some prescriptions and you don't have any CO pays, Is that right? Haven't had any yet. I mean, this year. Okay. Well, that's definitely nice. It sounds like you might have some extra help besides just Medicare. Do you have main care? Is that right? Yes, I do. Okay, so you have both Medicare and Medicaid. So you are dually eligible for benefits. Okay, so you mentioned that you have over the counter with your plan. Do you also have a food benefit that gives you a grocery card? Let me see. No, I guess not. You don't have a grocery card. Okay, and then what about dental benefits? You receive dental? Yes. Okay, and then eyeglass benefits. Do you have those? Transportation. Okay. And you said no CO pays on prescription. Oh, that's nice that your daughter lives nearby. It's good to have family. For sure. That's wonderful. How many daughters do you have? I have three and three boys. Three daughters? Oh, my goodness. Six kids. I was busy there way back. Wow. Well, it sounds like you were having fun, huh? That's a lot of fun. You had like, a baseball team, huh? Wow. I can't even keep the house clean with three kids. That's what we used to do, play ball. Oh, that's so cool. Six kids. Do you have any grandkids? I bet you have grandkids too, too, right? I got them. I got them in every state, I think. Oh, talk about being fruitful and multiplying. Good for you. What a blessing, huh? Yes. Yes, they are a blessing. Wow. Yeah. No, that's cool. How's it hard? It's probably hard not to have a favorite, huh? Yeah, it is. You be quiet. Yeah. We won't talk about who your favorite is, though. Everybody wants to be Mom's favorite. No, you love all of them, I'm sure. Okay, so you said you have over the counter, you have dental, you have [MEDICAL_PROCESS], you have zero copay. Sounds like your plan is pretty good. Are you with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Do you have [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION]? You have [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, got it. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yeah, [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is pretty big. Yeah, I wouldn't or anything unless they kick me out well, we could see. I mean, if you could get it. Oh, no, I don't want to mess anything up for you. It sounds like you have a good thing going. But if you have Medicaid and Medicare, you should be getting a food card through [ORGANIZATION]. Are you on their dual plan? Did you just recently get your main care? Well, I can't remember when it started. When it started. Did you go to a dual plan? No, they just added it. I didn't have anything to do with it, really. Okay. Well, I mean, I'd be happy to check. I'm starting to have the [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah, I forget a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that. Did one of your kids help you with your. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. Yeah. No, I'm very lucky. Your daughter helps you. Oh, yeah, my daughter [PERSON_NAME], she helps me a lot. Well, if you are eligible for a food card through [ORGANIZATION], then you should definitely see, because if you don't have any CO pays as of this year, if you've gotten main care, then you would qualify for the dual plan. Now, because you have [MEDICAL_CONDITION], obviously, I wouldn't make any changes for you, of course, without your power of [OCCUPATION] or not the right [OCCUPATION] there. But you can take down my information, Ms. [PERSON_NAME], because you may be able to upgrade to the dual plan. And the [ORGANIZATION] has a dual plan? Yeah. I don't understand all that, you know. So I don't get a dual. Oh, yeah. No, it is. It is hard to follow. Right. So there's regular Medicare Advantage plans. What? Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah, you were saying something? No, I can't. No, no. I'm just worried because I don't know if I'm doing the right things or if I'm missing out or whatever. I'm not complaining. Right. I don't want you to miss out on anything, for sure. I mean, I could look up your plan if you'd like. Do you have your red, white and blue Medicare card? I could see what plan you're on. I don't know where it is. Right behind it. No, don't worry. Don't bother. Well, if you have your ID card. Member ID card for [ORGANIZATION], what I would suggest you do. If you're confused about your benefits, and obviously you don't want to make any changes because you won't remember them, you have [MEDICAL_CONDITION], you can call [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and see if you're eligible for the food card because you may very well be missing out on benefits that you didn't even know you were entitled to. So I would definitely give them a call. Okay. All right. Well, I appreciate your time, Ms. [PERSON_NAME]. So if you have [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah. You were going to call [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I'm so confused. God. Yeah, no, I don't want to confuse you for sure, but if your daughter has health cards, I mean, you could just say. Yeah, no, I get it. You could just say that. Ask your daughter to call [ORGANIZATION]. Maybe. And maybe see if you can get the grocery card, because they do offer a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] grocery card for folks that have Medicare and Medicaid. Yeah. So you may be eligible for it, but if you're confused, I don't feel comfortable proceeding. So you can call the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] number, and I'll just put a note in here not to give you any more calls about your insurance. Okay. Okay. I guess so. My daughter's coming over there. Wow. Is your daughter coming over? Okay, well, you can definitely have her give us a call. Okay. All right. And that's the number that you just called, right? As I call. I don't know what. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Have you got your. Want to give me your number? Are you there? Oh, she hung up.

And Ms. [PERSON_NAME], do you only see a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] or do you also see specialists? I see a specialist. I see two. I said yes, I see a specialist. A [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. I see him once [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. Okay. All right, [OCCUPATION], is that this for, like, a checkup? Yes, the checkup. Okay. Now, do you have any major [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION], [MEDICAL_CONDITION], [MEDICAL_CONDITION], [MEDICAL_CONDITION], [INJURY], anything like that? No, I'm not. No [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. They've been checked. They don't check for that. I'm not. No, [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. Okay, good, good. All right, so it does look like you're currently on the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Medicare Advantage. Okay. And looks like you've been on that since [DATE_INTERVAL], but you've had [ORGANIZATION] since [DATE_INTERVAL]. Before that, it looks like you were on [ORGANIZATION]. Do you know why you switched from [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION]? I had. Because I had [ORGANIZATION] deal last year. I've been having all. Was this [ORGANIZATION], Medicare Advantage from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. Right. I didn't have get out of here all this year. All righty. Now, do you know why you switched though, from [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION]? No, not really. Okay, no worries. In quite a while. So I didn't. Yeah. Yes, it's. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME]. You were with [ORGANIZATION] all of last year and you've been with [ORGANIZATION] since [DATE_INTERVAL]? [DATE_INTERVAL], yes. All right. Now I'm going to check on it for you though. Okay. All right. Because I do actually represent all of the companies available to you, including [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], a lot of them. So I'm going to look to see. Alrighty. What we're doing here. All righty, let's see now. Do you still use the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yes. Okay, and then [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], is that your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]? She was the one seen after [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] passed. Okay. Primary position now is. Let me see, I'm gonna. Let me spell it. [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. So and [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Got it. All right, and then what's the name of your [OCCUPATION]? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, got it. All right. Okay. And so let me just continue here. Mail [ORGANIZATION] [PHONE_NUMBER] and you go to the [ORGANIZATION] that's on [LOCATION] [LOCATION], right? Yes. Okay. All right, so let's see what I can do to best help you. All righty. Okay. No premium. Okay. Look at a couple things. Full dental vision, hearing. Perfect. Oh no, this wouldn't count for you. All righty, so I'm going to pull up what you currently have so I can compare everything to see which one truly is best. You're in [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. Okay, here we are. You have Medicare Advantage HMO documents. Summary. Okay. S300 OTC, you get [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Okay, so it'll be a 35. All right, well, character, Alexa, Liberty, nurture. Get that? New plans. Alrighty, summary. Okay. F3 Dental. Alrighty. Lifetime. Yes, this is definitely going to be a lot stronger. OTC [MONEY_AMOUNT] grocery. No. All right, so like your plan, currently, like you, yes, you do have full dental. However, they only give you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] in dental benefits. Whereas I'm looking at another one that would give you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] in benefits for [MONEY_AMOUNT] dental. Now you do get an [DRUG] [DRUG] [DRUG] allowance to be which is like a mail in already. And, and they give you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] every [DURATION] [DURATION] where this one would give you $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right. And this one would also give you what's called a flex card. Well, it's not [DRUG] [DRUG]. It's also for the kind of medicine. So I, I have that and when. But other than that. But. Right, right. So now this is not just for [DRUG] [DRUG] [DRUG] [DRUG]. This is also for your toiletries. You can use it for like toothpaste, deodorant, toilet paper, things like that. Yeah, I have it. Yeah. Right. So right now that you give me [MONEY_AMOUNT], this will give you [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Now this is, but this is also just a lot stronger, like for your dental and vision and hearing. So like your dental, you're only getting [MONEY_AMOUNT] where this would give you [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So I really don't, I don't want to change. No insurance or nothing like that, just for that. So, so. Oh no, I understand. Okay, that's fine. We don't have to. I'm going to say that these plans are just a lot, a lot, a lot stronger. Now it does show that you do. So you don't pay like you don't pay the premium, but you do still have co pays. You do still have to pay like co pays. So let me see. See Plan. The only school payment I pay is that special. And it's a small, it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that's. Yeah, it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Correct. Okay, that's it. The [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and, and the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Right, right, right, exactly. Now let's see. Now it is just like, it is just good because like God forbid you did ever end up in the hospital and got admitted, you know, right now it would cost you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per [DURATION] for the first [DURATION] [DURATION], whereas the one that would give you more back and all the other benefits would only cost you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per [DURATION] per [DURATION] for the first [DURATION] [DURATION]. So that would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT] a [DURATION] savings. But that's the worst case scenario if you ended up [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So it really just depends, you know. Yes, it would be a new insurance carrier. However, of course I always check to make sure your [OCCUPATION] accept it. So that way it doesn't affect any of your [DURATION] to [DURATION] life, you know. So that would be the only thing that would change is the actual name of the carrier. Not your [OCCUPATION], not your pharmacy or anything like that. All right. Because this truly is a much better plan. I mean, I know if you want to stay with [ORGANIZATION], I can look just at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I just know you. [ORGANIZATION] doesn't have a strong benefit. The only good thing about [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, I'm sorry. This one I have is aarp, Medicare Advantage from [ORGANIZATION]. Right. It didn't. It been dormant. Right. So for. So you know. Right. I hear you changing. I, I understand completely. No, I will. Obviously I'm not going to do anything that you don't want to do. It's just a matter of, you know, a matter of saving money. It's saving money and getting more back. So that's what we do here. That's the whole point of looking for additional benefit. Now, again, I can tell me about the money back on my Social Security check. And I've been told that all down to [DURATION] [DURATION], but I never got nothing back on it. So I just said I don't even think about it no more. Well, that's why I'll explain that to you then right now. So some people do qualify for the money back into their Social Security check. Now, those people are people who do not have extra help or partial extra help. So what happens is everybody who has Medicare Part B who do not have extra help, they pay $[MONEY_AMOUNT] every month for their part B. That's just regulated by the government. So what all these insurance carriers, did they. That it's called a part B reduction. So they put money back into the check as a part B reduct. Now, since you do not pay for your part B, it would not qualify you for a part B reduction. So that's the only way you can get the money back is if you pay Medicare. So if you Medicare, which people do not have extra help, they pay $[MONEY_AMOUNT] every month for their part B. Because you have part extra help, you do not pay the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that's, that's, that would be the only way you would qualify to get money back is if you did pay for part B. I paid, paid that. $[MONEY_AMOUNT] is out of my check every month. Let me see here. Let me look here. Because it tells me and I do get the extra help on my going to medicine. I don't pay anything for that. So. Okay, let me check here. So if you do, I'm gonna have someone look at this then. So if you do, then yeah, of course I'm gonna look at the extra money to get you back because I know [LOCATION] does have plans. Let's see. Premium details. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [PERSON_NAME] enrollment, [EVENT] amount. Okay. Alrighty. It does look like you do all right. Yes. Usually people, when I see extra help, they don't pay it. So let me look then. Definitely should qualify if you pay that. Let's see, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, so let's look then. Gotcha. [PERSON_NAME].

Actually, yeah, your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] accepts it, so there would be no problem there. Nope, you wouldn't have to change a [OCCUPATION]. The only thing you'd ever. You'd have to do is give a [OCCUPATION] a new card after [DATE_INTERVAL], because this would be effective [DATE_INTERVAL] so you wouldn't have to change your [OCCUPATION] there.

I didn't enroll. I just called for information. The next thing I know, I'm getting, you're enrolled in this, you're enrolled in that. Then I had to call and find out how to get disenrolled. So with all that, I just keep what I had the year before because I knew what I had, and this was crazy. Yeah, yeah. That's why I'm. At least they kept you busy there. Oh, was a nightmare. I see. I see. All right, so Let me look at [ORGANIZATION] here to see if they have anything updated here. [ORGANIZATION] been taking good care of you there. So any benefits that's very important to you like getting glasses or [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] done? Well, yeah. That's nice. That's nice. I do need a new. I do need my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and then new glasses and well, I'm due for some [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], have that checked out. So that would come in handy. Definitely. Okay. All right. And how many [OCCUPATION] do you see right now total? So far I've only seen my regular [OCCUPATION] and I saw a specialist, SO2, but I don't know when. I don't expect to see them again too soon down the line. I'm scheduled for a reappointment in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Okay. Just a regular checkup, follow up visit. Right. Okay, so you say just one. So you have a zero copay when you go visit primary. It's a look like it's a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] copay for a specialist visit. And looks like you get some vision, dental and hearing. Do you use any over the counter products, things like [DRUG], [DRUG], toothpaste, things like that? Well, occasionally. Okay. Do you use it through your plan with [ORGANIZATION] or do you pay for it out of pocket? Well, I haven't used it with my plan yet. Okay. All right, so looks like the [ORGANIZATION] plan. Go ahead. I was just going to say if I needed it, I just bought it out of pocket. Mm. Yeah, they have it set up the way you can purchase so much every quarter. Kind of help you save money there because price of things now every little [MONEY_AMOUNT], you know, can help to save and use it. Yeah, but look, like all the [ORGANIZATION] plans, that one has, the lowest co pays 0 and [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Everything else is going to be higher. They do have 1 here that's 0 and 35, but it does have a monthly premium. So you want to keep you at a zero monthly premium also. So it looks like you've been with [ORGANIZATION] for Quite a while, since [DATE_INTERVAL], since you got your Medicare. And evidently they've taken good care of you at [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, and unfortunately, you know, I'm just really getting checkups, basically. You sound like you're staying healthy. Let me see. It doesn't look like you're I taking that many medications at all. How lucky I am. Well, I have [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. That's basically what I'm taking. Well, hey, you know, a lot of people, what we do, that's from what we eat and we got to put up with all these high prices, you know, at the pump and at the grocery store. That makes your [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION] go up, too. That's true. Yeah. So pretty much, overall, you know, you're pretty healthy. That is the better plan, the lowest copay plan. I was trying to see if [ORGANIZATION] had anything with lower co pays, will save you money, but pretty much that's the best one that they have. So it look like you're all set. Okay, great. Well, thank you for your time. Hope you enjoyed the rest of you. Thank you. Yeah, that was easy. Makes you feel better. Makes you feel better that you just don't have to listen to anymore. Get all you're entitled to. You know, you feel that you're comfortable where you are, so. Well, thank you for five more plans. Yeah, no more. No more. All right. Have a good time.

"Thank you for holding. This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] with the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] giving you a call regarding a Medicare review. How are you doing today? Pretty good to you? So, yeah, the call, like I said, is mainly for a Medicare review so we can make sure you're not missing out on any benefits in your area. I'll get that done for you today.

[HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. No, there's a [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] after [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okay, [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER], easy [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okay. Yeah, I knew it was missing some kind of number. All right. And do you know who you're covered under at the moment? Like [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]? No, I. I don't know if. If I'm covered under any of those. Okay, [ORGANIZATION], I'll take a check into it. That's part of what the review is for today. We'll see what you have and we'll see what's out there. We see what you need, and we'll go from there. All right. Sorry, my system's a little bit slow. It's ran by the government, so bear with me. Okay. All right. So I do see that you have [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] at the moment. Let me see what else is out there for you. Because the welfare plan, this plan usually costs, so I hope you're not getting charged for this. I don't. I don't know, really. Okay, let me check. Yeah, I want to make sure you're saving. Yeah, it does look like you're being charged for this [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] plan. So you're being charged $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. There is another plan in your area. I mean, the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is a good plan, but I can. You know, usually people don't want to be charged for their healthcare if they have another choice. So let me pull up an option in your area that's at $[MONEY_AMOUNT] and compare it to the one that you're paying [MONEY_AMOUNT] for. Okay. So the plan you have is called [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. And just to make it easy, the plan that I'm pulling up that is no cost monthly, is called [ORGANIZATION] no premium. So it says in the name that it doesn't cost you anything. Alright, so just comparing plans side by side, looks like the CO pays are pretty similar. Like if you were to stay [DURATION] [DURATION] in the hospital, looks like the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] assist is [MONEY_AMOUNT] per night. The [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] no premium is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So just about the same. The primary. Yeah. So they're just about the same for the co pays. Looks like the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] visits are both $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for both plans and both $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for specialists on both plans. All the other co pays look exactly the same. Now, since the co pays are the same, let's go ahead and look at the benefits. Looks like for the dental, both come with two [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and two [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] at no cost. And looks like they both cover dentures. Okay, so it looks like you get $[MONEY_AMOUNT] in dental with the [ORGANIZATION] Assist, but the no premium still gives you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] for your dental. So it's half the dental, but it's still $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. They both get $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for your eyeglasses, but as you see, they're pretty similar. Really, the only difference is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] compared to [MONEY_AMOUNT] for dental. But the one with 1500, you're not paying 2160amonth. So you're saving $[MONEY_AMOUNT] of real cash every year. So does this look like. Yeah. Does this look like something you want to look into? Just going from the assist to the no premium. So we could lose that premium monthly? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Really, the only difference is that dental. But it's still enough dental for you to get everything done. Unless dental is super important for you. Do you see yourself doing a lot of procedures this year? No, probably not usually. From my experience, $[MONEY_AMOUNT] is usually a whole lot. Anyway, let me go ahead and check something for you. So it's still with [ORGANIZATION]. So you're not really changing carriers, you're just changing the name of the plan. Now I want to verify the. Make sure everything goes through smooth. Do you see a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]? Not. No, I don't go to the [OCCUPATION]. So I would have to. It would be a new one if I did, I mean. Okay. Would you like me to help you find. Well, I don't know any, so I guess that would be a good idea. Yeah, I'll Help you find one. Do you prefer [GENDER_SEXUALITY] or [GENDER_SEXUALITY]? [GENDER_SEXUALITY]. [GENDER_SEXUALITY]. Okay, so the first one I see is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. He's very accredited. He's on [LOCATION] [LOCATION] in [LOCATION]. If you want to write his information down, I can give that to you. You. That's [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yep. Correct. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. On [LOCATION]. Yes. [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. That's in [LOCATION]. Yeah. Huh. [LOCATION]. Okay. And their direct phone number is [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PHONE_NUMBER], did you say? Yes, the last four numbers. Yeah, [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Yes. Okay. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Correct. All right, so, yeah, if this [OCCUPATION] accepts the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] plan. So you're going to lose that premium monthly going forward, but you're still going to keep all the copays. Exactly. Well, just about the same. And the benefit is just about the same as [ORGANIZATION], except for the dental. Now another thing I want to verify is your medications. How many medications do you take? Well, right now I'm not taking any. I suppose I. If. When I see a [OCCUPATION], I'm sure he'll prescribe something, but I don't have any at the moment. But for now you don't have any. Gotcha. All right, [ORGANIZATION], if you ever have any, like. Yeah, like you said, if you ever get any, they will. This, this plan will cover it. So you are all set on. Okay. All right. All right. So if you have a pen and a piece of paper, I want to give you some important information. I want to give you my name and my number. Yeah, I've got a pen and paper here. All right, perfect. So my name is [PERSON_NAME]. That's going to be spelled [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, that's unusual. It's usually with a [PERSON_NAME], isn't it? Yeah, yeah, that's why I usually just spell it out. Yeah. And yeah, my last name is going to be [PERSON_NAME]. That one. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. That one's a little bit less unusual. Oh, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm sorry, I didn't understand that at first. Okay, yeah, [PERSON_NAME]. And my direct phone number is going to be [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PHONE_NUMBER]. That's [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Did you say [PHONE_NUMBER]? Correct. All right, that's correct. All right, sounds good. So I'm setting everything up for you. You don't take medications we verified and got you a [OCCUPATION]. So do you have any questions for me at this time? Oh, I don't. Did you tell me the name of the [OCCUPATION]? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, yeah, I. I wrote it in another part of the piece. Okay, I've got it now. All right. And he's the one on [LOCATION] [LOCATION], right? Yes, he's the one. Correct. Okay. Correct. So, yeah, I'm getting everything set up for you. If you allow me to put you on a brief hold. I'm just going to. Oh, wait. Actually, let me verify your address. I have [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. That's right. [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]. Yep. That is what I got as [ORGANIZATION]. So I'm just about all set. Let me put you on a brief hold. I just got to verify a couple other things. I'll be right back for you. Okay? All right.

"[DURATION] [DURATION]. I'm here. I'm still here. Just [DURATION] [DURATION]. You've reached [PERSON_NAME] at the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Do I have the pleasure of speaking to [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]? Yes, that's me. Good. My job here is to make sure that you've got the best Medicare policy picked out for your needs this year so that you don't miss out on any benefits or savings. Was that your understanding as well? Yes, yes. Okay, good. I just need to make sure that you do make all your own health care decisions by yourself. Yep, yep. Perfect. My national producer number is [NUMBER_SEQUENCE]. All my calls are recorded here for your protection. Do you have your red, white and blue Medicare health insurance card on you? Yes, I do. Oh, great. Let me go back to my desk now so I can collect that and save it. Excuse me. You are excused. Alrighty. I am ready for your red, white and blue card number. Okay, it's the Medicare number. [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER], [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER], [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER], [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER], [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER], [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER], [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER], [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. And then right underneath that, there's going to be a date next to the word hospital, part A. What's the date you see there? [MEDICAL_CONDITION]? Starts at [DATE] [DATE]. [DATE]. [DATE]. Yes. Okay. All righty then. Let's see here. Bear with me about [DURATION] [DURATION]. I'm going to pull up your profile and we'll be able to get started. Meanwhile, I'll just kind of tell you that my goal is to truly find you the very best policy to suit your needs. Because I know how many calls you guys get and how confusing and frustrating. I'm glad you appreciate that. That's why I haven't been answering the phone. Because just these, all these calls just overwhelm me. I found out last year if I just answer one of these calls and do this, just thought for a while, all I get done [DURATION] [DURATION] does. [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] to [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] eat is chase my thing. I know, I know. I'm glad you understand. I can't stop them from calling, but I can give you the peace of mind knowing that they can help you. Okay. Even if we find a plan that's just as good as the plan that you're on right now, we might want to go for it. Because it sounds like you don't have an agency that you can turn to to get your plan working the way that you want it. Is that right? I don't know. When I had, I was doing pretty good with. But then I talked to another [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. He said the better plan for me was AARP, and that started on [DATE] [DATE]. Since I had. Since I switched to AARP, I've been just kind of lost. Was just overwhelming. I mean, they want to make an appointment to have a [OCCUPATION] come and see me, which they did with you. Man, that was great. But all these calls are just too much. Yeah. Well, we definitely teach you how to use your insurance after we put you on it, and we'll make sense of all that stuff. Mm. Did. So you're. What I think I'm hearing you say is that you like [ORGANIZATION] better. Yeah. Okay. I mean, so far, I've never had to use my AARP card yet because I never had to refill any prescriptions yet. But I have to pretty soon. And I've already been to the [OCCUPATION], the hospital, since I have this new AARP card. It says here I've got, like, a specialist $[MONEY_AMOUNT] copay. Er, $[MONEY_AMOUNT] copay. [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] copay. It lives a little better than [ORGANIZATION]. What I'm finding out, sir, is that every plan in your area is subpar. That's unfortunate. It's not your fault. They're not very good insurance policies. No. Okay. Yeah. I was [TIME] [TIME] hospital. I was [TIME] [TIME] hospital, and I got, like, $[MONEY_AMOUNT] worth of medical bills to pay there. Now, one thing might save you because it looks like you got full extra help. Okay. Yeah. So what we need to do is figure out your level of Medicaid. Okay. And that's easy to do if you don't have a Medicaid card, which I'm expecting you not to have one because I think you only get slmb, which is partial Medicaid. You can provide me with your social if you don't have your Medicaid card. And we'll pull it up and we'll. And if you have a real level of Medicaid, we can do wonders on your account. I don't have the Medicaid card, which is, like, through the state of [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. But what the state of [LOCATION] does for me, they make my Medicare premium insurances for me. You understand that they part B premium, and then they. They help you on your drugs? Yeah. Yeah. I had a pretty good drug plan. Like, each prescription, like, $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], something like that. So it's not too bad. That's good. What can I ask you for your social, anyway? Just to check your Medicaid? Sure, yeah. You ready? Yep. [US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER] [US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER], [US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER], [US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER], [US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER] [US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER], [US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER]. [DATE_INTERVAL]. Still just kind of spinning there. Weird. He said take time to hoy. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Yeah. [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PHONE_NUMBER]. All right, I'm just going to assume that you have SLMB then. Let's see here. Wonder if you can get on that typey. Pretty cool. Wow, those deductibles are ridiculous. $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deductible on almost every policy [TIME] [TIME] area. The only policy that didn't have a deductible was that [ORGANIZATION] plan. I like the [ORGANIZATION] plan best. Even though it's got a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] premium or copay for the, for the primary. You want to, you want to just go back to [ORGANIZATION]. I think that you would be better off. Yes, do that because. Yeah, let me get in touch with the [ORGANIZATION] [OCCUPATION] real quick. Yeah, okay. I hope not mad because I switched. I didn't know what I was doing. Yeah, no, I totally get it. You know, they'll tell you all these things. They're not really, they don't really need to tell you the deductible in order to do their job. That's [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] that you were about to spend. So definitely we're going to get you back. Okay, good. Another thing I liked about [ORGANIZATION], they give you like, I don't know, [MONEY_AMOUNT] or $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] to spend up like the pharmacy. That really helped me here, you know. Yeah, that does help. Different kind of over the counter things like [DRUG] [DRUG] and you know, creams and stuff. That really helped me a lot. I like that. I miss it too. My friend has AARP and she says she gets that, but I haven't seen it. Well, I've got a gentleman that is a whiz kid at [ORGANIZATION] and he's definitely going to help you. His name is [PERSON_NAME]. He's just getting ready to take your call here in a moment. Okay. All right, I'm going to go ahead and send you on over. Okay, bud, God bless you. Stay safe. I'm glad we're able to do this for you. This is the right move for sure. Here's [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, thank you, bud. Thank you for calling the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hello, thank you for holding. This is [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] to the pleasure of speaking with [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yes, you do. Hey [PERSON_NAME], looks like we're on the phone here so we can go ahead and take a look at your old [ORGANIZATION] plan that you used to be on before. Let's take a look at this really quick. Do you know why you got off of it? Had a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], call me at [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. I'm just getting up. I wasn't wake up and listen to him. He said a RP was better for me, so I let him switch me. Alright, so what I want to do now is I'm actually going to run a Medicaid verification check. Okay. So this is going to tell me what level of Medicaid you have. All right. And then from there I'll be able to take a look. So you're in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], correct? Yes. All right. And that's [LOCATION] [LOCATION], correct? Yep. All right. And your date of birth, let's see, [DATE_OF_BIRTH] [DATE_OF_BIRTH], [DATE_OF_BIRTH] [DATE_OF_BIRTH] [DATE_OF_BIRTH] [DATE_OF_BIRTH] [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. That's correct. Excellent. Let's see here. Yes, [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. All right, let's see here. All right, looks like your Medicaid is inactive. So that's okay. You still have full extra help. Alright. And let's see what we can do about that. Okay, so out of all the plans in your area, you're currently [TIME] [TIME] one with a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] annual health deductible. That's insane to say the least. Yeah, you're paying so [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So do you know what a deductible is? On what? Do you know what a deductible is? Like just any deductible. Do you know what that is? It's what I got to pay up front. Right. So you got $[MONEY_AMOUNT], you got to pay up front right now. And if you haven't yet, probably getting a bill for it. If you've used the plan. Have you used AARP anywhere besides your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] office? I haven't used it anywhere because I got it [DATE] [DATE] and I haven't been anywhere. Yeah, I've never used it. That's good. So do you have any [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION] like [MEDICAL_CONDITION] or a [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION]? No. All right, so yeah. Then what we're going to do here is. I mean it looks like the best bet is probably that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], PPO, no deductible. Okay. [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] visits are $[MONEY_AMOUNT], specialist visits are [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But again, you save the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. That again, the deductible is trying to charge you with aarp. What's the name of your [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. You want the phone number? No, it's okay. Got it. Is this the only [OCCUPATION] you're seeing? Yes. All right, perfect. We got [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] here and this is the only [OCCUPATION] that you're seeing currently. So that's good. All right. All right. And you See her in [LOCATION] [LOCATION], correct? Yes. All right, excellent. So very easy here, then. Only [OCCUPATION] that you're seeing. Let's go over a few things. Let's take a look at your address really quick. So I've got your address as [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION], right? That's correct. All right. And [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Yes. All right, excellent. So, again, with this plan, it's called the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] PPO. No deductible. So therefore, it saves you $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. Drug plan is $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. $[MONEY_AMOUNT] copay for the prescription drug plan. Again, [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] visits are $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. [OCCUPATION] visits are [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] are 0 to 100. [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] are 0 to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MEDICAL_PROCESS] are [MONEY_AMOUNT] to 380. [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] are [MONEY_AMOUNT] to 105. [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Inpatient is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per [DURATION] for days one through five. After that, [DURATION] six through [MONEY_AMOUNT] are 0 to 91 and beyond are 0. Outpatient hospital coverage is [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT], copay per visit. Preventative services are 0. And it looks like all 11 of your medications are covered. So that's all good news. Yeah. Again, it's probably outdated the number of medications I have. I know you know that. We have 11 medications on file for you here, and it looks like [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG] [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG]. Again, the other two are [DRUG], so they don't even count. So you think I got all your medications? Yes. All right, perfect. So, yeah. So then I guess. Do you have any questions about anything? No, I don't. Can I just use my old [ORGANIZATION] card and throw my [ORGANIZATION] card away? So, basically, this you can, but they're gonna send you a new one. And the plan is not going to start until [DATE] [DATE], but that's, again, only about. Only about [DURATION] [DURATION] from now. So let's do this. First, I need to give you my name and my phone number to write down. Whenever you're ready. Give me one second. Okay, I'm ready. All right, so my first name is [PERSON_NAME]. So that's going to be [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, I got that. Phone number is [PHONE_NUMBER]. And you're with. You're with. You're with. You're with Medicare. I'm not. No, I'm licensed and appointed with. With [ORGANIZATION]. And I work for a company called Medicare [ORGANIZATION]. But if it's. It's easier for you, if it's easier for you if you just put [ORGANIZATION] next to my name. So here's the deal, [PERSON_NAME]. What's what we're going to do next year. Do me a favor. I gave you my phone number, right? Yes. All right, read that back to me real quick. [PHONE_NUMBER]. Perfect. So here's we're going to do next. So per [ORGANIZATION] guidelines [TIME] [TIME] state of [LOCATION] [LOCATION], all enrollments must be done on an inbound line. So all that means is that I need to hang up and I just need you to call me back immediately on my [PHONE_NUMBER] number that I just gave you. We're going to do a quick application with [ORGANIZATION] and then you're going to be good to go starting again starting [DATE] [DATE]. Back with [ORGANIZATION]. So I'm going to hang up now. Just call me back immediately. I'll be waiting on your call. Are we on your home phone or a cell phone? I'm doing cell thing. All right, perfect. So I'm just gonna hang up now. Just call me back immediately. Okay, will do. All right, I will speak with you in a second. Call me back immediately. Bye.",success,False,False,False,True,3048158500_P2_transcript.json

You know, usually they're working off of commission. Alrighty, Now I am not a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] nor do I commission. I'm not commission based. Alrighty. So I do represent some of the largest insurance carriers like on [ORGANIZATION] that you're on currently. Well, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Everything that you've been on I represent.

[LOCATION]. Have you started taking any brand new prescriptions in the last [DURATION] [DURATION]? [DURATION] [DURATION]? No, not the last [DURATION] [DURATION], no. Okay. All right, have you taken a couple [DRUG] [DRUG]? Have you taken [DRUG] [DRUG]? [DRUG], [DRUG] [DRUG]. Does that sound right? About six or seven medications. What pharmacy do you go to when you pick up those medications? [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. All right, I can give you the list of medication I take. Yeah, we'll definitely double check that in a minute if we need to. All right. So how many [OCCUPATION] do you go and see throughout the year regularly? My [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. His name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] answered the [RELIGION], the best I can pronounce it. And my [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Now, those two [OCCUPATION], I see them throughout the year. But all the others, that may be like a spectrum, something happened, I go to the hospital or something like that. They come in, come in. Those are two [OCCUPATION] that care for me right now. Okay. All right. And are you happy with the, you know, with the insurance company that you're with? [ORGANIZATION]? Well, no, I can't say I'm happy. They got me paying a co. Pay. I ain't happy with that. For your medicine, you're saying medication is very, very expensive. So let's see if we can find you. Yeah, let's see if we can find you. Some better drug coverage. Let's go ahead and verify the medications that you're taking. I have a list here, but if you want to grab your list, let's go ahead and update it. And, you know, I'll. I'll plug in a couple pharmacies, I'll plug in a couple different policies, and we'll see if we can't save you some money. If we can, we'll go over it together. You can call out what I'm taking, and I know if I'm taking or not, and I'll verify you call out what you. Okay, yeah, we'll do. We'll do. Let me just pull up the list here. All right, so I think this first one here is [DRUG] for cholesterol from a [DRUG]. [DRUG]. It starts with an [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG]. [DRUG], [DRUG]. I don't take that anymore. I did one time, but I don't take it anymore. All right. [DRUG]. Like an [DRUG]? No, I don't take that either. That was the problem was when I ate a [MEDICAL_CONDITION] or [MEDICAL_CONDITION] or something. No, I don't take that no more. All right. [DRUG] [DRUG], [DRUG] [DRUG], [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER], [DRUG], [DRUG], [DRUG] [DRUG]. For [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. Is that the one that costs a lot? That's the one that they expect. All right, next one is [DRUG], also for [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. That's the next one. No, two PO's caused me a fortune. All right. Are you still taking [DRUG]? Yes, they not too expensive, but I still take them. All right. What about [DRUG] [DRUG]? No. What about [DRUG]? No. All right, so just three medications. The two, [MEDICAL_CONDITION] and the [DRUG]? That's right. Yeah. That's what I'm taking now. And it's [ORGANIZATION] that you go to, [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. Okay. All right. All right, let me see here. It. When you had [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in the past, were your prescriptions pretty high with [ORGANIZATION]? Do you remember? Oh, I remember. I remember [ORGANIZATION], But I didn't use them too much because I was confused between them and [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] or whatever. So I was back and forth until I got this straightened out last [DATE_INTERVAL]. I got it all straightened out, but I. Okay. It was pretty much the same as what I'm paying now with. With the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], whatever they call themselves. They were pretty much the same thing. Okay. Yeah, I'm looking at it here. Looks like, unfortunately, those medications are just fairly expensive. Looks like they're going to be pretty expensive with almost every company. So you know. Did you have problems with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Do you like [ORGANIZATION] better than [ORGANIZATION]? I mean do you want to stay with [ORGANIZATION]? Do you want to look at. At the time? So I guess I would use them both but they, they would blue. I mean [ORGANIZATION] had my medicine and they. I don't know if they were using both of them or not, but I know I was getting prescription field and, and sometime I get a statement from [ORGANIZATION]. But I, I closed out [ORGANIZATION] at [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and I only have a mini food cross out. So that's who I'm with now. I understand all that. But before I didn't understand. I know I was just going getting a prescription field and, and they were feeling it and I wasn't on top of what was going on, but I finally got a insight on what was happening last year in [DATE_INTERVAL] when I got. Got all that mail and stuff explaining to us. I know, yeah, cool, cool, that's great. Okay. And the reason why I went with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] over [ORGANIZATION] because my [MARITAL_STATUS] when she was working, she. She was using [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] through her job we have wound up with them. So I just stuck with. Okay, sure. Let me double check one more thing for you. Hang, hang on. Okay, it. Yes, sir. So it's like far as everything goes, you know, those medications I feel like are just going to be fairly expensive. You know, it looks like they're about the same with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], you know. Are you okay with just staying with [ORGANIZATION], you know, where you're at for the rest of the year or do you want to try and make a change? Well, I just don't.

Thank you for calling [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. How can I help you? Hello, I have [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] on the line looking to get information regarding their medicare plan options. [PERSON_NAME], you're in a good hands, and the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] will take care of you from here. Hope you both have a great day. Hi, [PERSON_NAME], can you hear me okay? Yes. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm a [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] here with [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I'm glad you were transferred to me. We're helping medicare beneficiaries get more benefits and save money on medical costs, so I'm happy to help. Before we get started, Medicare law does require that I read your privacy disclosure first, so bear with me just a moment, okay? Okay. Okay. So just so you know, our costs are recorded for quality and you do not have to provide any health information unless it's used to determine your eligibility to enroll. I also need to let you know that we may collect personal information like your name and zip code in order to view the plans in your area. For more information, you can view our full terms and privacy policy at. [PERSON_NAME], are we discussing medicare options just for you or you and somebody else? Yeah, you may discuss it with me. Right, [PERSON_NAME]? But is this just for you or is it for you and somebody else? Just me. Okay. Does anyone help make your healthcare decisions? No. Okay. And, [PERSON_NAME], if we get disconnected, is it okay to call back this number? [PHONE_NUMBER]. Yes. Thank you. Is that a landline or cell phone? Landline. Okay. And I'm happy to look up some benefits here for you. What is your zip code? [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Yes. Okay. And, [PERSON_NAME], I assume you already have medicare part A and part B, right? Yes. Okay, good. So, [PERSON_NAME], our main job is to just make sure you're receiving all the benefits you qualify for and save money on your medical costs. So what are some benefits that you would like to see on your. On your medicare plan? I ain't giving anything. You haven't given any thought by me. Okay. Did you say you haven't given Any thought I don't know, I had. Okay, well, that's fair. Most people don't. I mean, it's not something they think about every day, so that's fair. Well, let's see if we can give us some thoughts today. How about, for example, dental? Is dental coverage something that's important to you? When was the last time you went to your [OCCUPATION]? I didn't understand what you were saying. Is [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] something that's important to you, [PERSON_NAME]? No, I think I have most of everything I need. Okay, well, like I said, our job is to make sure that you're getting not just what you have now, but make sure that you're getting everything you're qualified for. So if you had your plan for a while, for example, there may be some upgrades that you're missing out on. We want to make sure that you're getting everything that you can, right? I think so. Okay. And honestly, if your plan is the best one that's available for you in your area, perfectly fine, we can leave it alone. But if there's a plan that would offer you more benefits, like more dental or more vision coverage or better prescription drug coverage, whatever it is that you want, we can help find those plans and get you signed up for those plans. Does that make sense? Yeah, I hear what you're saying. I think I have a good plan. Yeah. And again, it's possible that you have the best plan that's available for you, but if there is something that's better for you in your area, then obviously we want to sign up for those plans. Right. Okay. And I can help you do that. Oh, okay. Well, I think I'm satisfied with what I have. Okay, well, [PERSON_NAME], you're certainly under no. No obligation or anything to make any changes that you don't want to. Like I said, all we wanted to do is see if there's a way that we could help you get some more benefit if you're lacking something or if you're not taking advantage of something that was available to you today. Okay. So are there any benefits that you think are lacking that you would like more of? I'm sorry? I hear what you said. So are there any benefits that you would like more of on your medic plan? No, I don't think so. Okay. No extra prescription plan or dental plan or vision plan that would help you out? No. No, I still don't. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, like I said, you're not under any obligation to make any changes, but if something changes in the future where you do want to see some more extra benefits on your Medicare. Feel free to give us a call, okay? I sure will. Okay. Any other questions or concerns I could address for you before you go? No. All right. Well, thank you for your time, [PERSON_NAME], and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Bye. Bye.",success,True,False,True,True,3232950392_P2_transcript.json
